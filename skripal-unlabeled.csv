https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-finally-finds-reasons-to-punish-russia,0,0,after fourteen months of mixed signals and confused policy on russia the trump administration took twin actions on thursday to address the increasingly aggressive moves by the government of vladimir putin washington slapped sanctions on nineteen prominent russian individuals and five entitiesincluding russian intelligence servicesfor meddling in the presidential election and for malicious cyberattacks that targeted a stunning array of americas infrastructure from the us energy grid and nuclear plants to aviation water systems and manufacturing in an intriguing twist thirteen of the russians who were sanctioned were indicted last month in the investigation by the special counsel robert mueller president trump has repeatedly dismissed allegations that russia tried to sway the electionas a hoax or fake newsdespite the unanimous consensus of the intelligence community when the president met putin in vietnam in november he even embraced the russian leaders denial of any role in the us presidential vote he said he absolutely did not meddle in our election he did not do what theyre saying he did trump told reporters aboard air force one four months ago that whole thing was set up by the democrats the new sanctions stop decidedly short of charging that russia actually influenced the outcome of the vote in trumps favorsomething trump has vehemently argued did not occur but they are the most significant of limited actions the administration has adopted since taking office the white house imposed the sanctions as the times reported that mueller had recently subpoenaed documents from the trump organization related to russia as well as other topics that the special counsel is investigating the trump organization oversees the business ventures the president amassed before taking office if true the move by mueller brings the investigation closer than ever to the president and his family circle in addition to the sanctions the white house issued a joint statement with the three big european powersbritain france and germanycondemning russia for using a chemical weapon in a recent assassination attempt on a former spy sergei v skripal and his daughter yulia in britain this use of a militarygrade nerve agent of a type developed by russia constitutes the first offensive use of a nerve agent in europe since the second world war the statement said it threatens the security of us all britain reported that skripal was exposed to novichok which was developed by russia more than thirty years ago but has never been used on a battlefield scientists report that it is more dangerous than vx and sarin the two other betterknown nerve agents and is harder to trace skripal a former militaryintelligence officer who was arrested in russia in for spying for britain was released in a spy swap in he and his daughter collapsed on a public bench in salisbury england on march th both are still in critical condition the attack was widely considered a warning from moscow to russian dissidents exiles and spies on a broader level however the attack in britain and the meddling in american elections are considered signs of putins boldness in spreading his influence globallywell beyond ukraine which his forces invaded in or syria where it dispatched new military advisers warplanes and other major military equipment in putin is moving deeplyand blatantlyinto the west now too on a scale similar to the soviet union during the cold war the joint statement called the skripal assassination attempt which also seriously injured a police officer and others an assault on britains sovereignty as well as a breach of international law and russias commitment under the chemical weapons convention we call on russia to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the un security council to uphold international peace and security the four governments said the statement followed heated attacks on russia at the un security council on wednesday but it opted not to try to adopt a formal resolution because russia holds one of the five vetoes trumps public comments on the poisoning have not been quite as tough as the white houses statement pressed on russias culpability in the attack on the former russian spy he told reporters it looks like it i spoke with the british prime minister and we are in deep discussions a very sad situation it certainly looks like the russians were behind it something that should never ever happen were taking it very seriously as are i think many others the trump administration said its moves this week do not reflect the full scope of its response by no means will this constitute the end of our ongoing campaign to instruct mr putin to change his behavior a senior nationalsecurity official said during a white house teleconference briefing treasury secretary steven mnuchin specifically warned russian officials and oligarchs against destabilizing activities the department of homeland security and the fbi issued an alert accompanying the sanctions that detailed the wide scope of russias cyberattack on american infrastructure it described the attack as a multistage intrusion campaign by russian government cyber actors who targeted small commercial facilities networks where they staged malware conducted spear phishing and gained remote access into energy sector networks the russian organizations sanctioned include the federal security service which is the successor to the soviet unions notorious kgb as well as russian military intelligence or gru both were also sanctioned by the obama administration for their role in election interference also cited were the internet research agency and twelve people working for it in various capacities russia said thursday that it was preparing a response and blamed the us move on washingtons political dysfunction it is tied to us internal disorder tied of course to our election calendar deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov told the news agency tass russians holds a presidential election on sunday that putin is expected to win in a landslide the only real question is the turnout

this story comment gift article share president trump seemed distracted in march as his aides briefed him at his maralago resort on the administrations plan to expel russian diplomats and suspected spies the united states they explained would be ousting roughly the same number of russians as its european allies part of a coordinated move to punish moscow for the poisoning of a former russian spy and his daughter on british soil well match their numbers trump instructed according to a senior administration official were not taking the lead were matching the next day when the expulsions were announced publicly trump erupted officials said to his shock and dismay france and germany were each expelling only four russian officials far fewer than the his administration had decided on the posts anton troianovski and louisa loveluck explain why the joint united states military strike against syria on april will likely have little effect video anton troianovski louisa loveluck joyce leethe washington post the president who seemed to believe that other individual countries would largely equal the united states was furious that his administration was being portrayed in the media as taking by far the toughest stance on russia advertisement his briefers tried to reassure him that the sum total of european expulsions was roughly the same as the us number i dont care about the total the administration official recalled trump screaming the official like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations growing angrier trump insisted that his aides had misled him about the magnitude of the expulsions there were curse words the official said a lot of curse words after airstrikes against syrian chemical weapons facilities on april lawmakers and trump administration officials weighed in on the attack video jenny starrsthe washington post photo susan walshthe washington post the incident reflects a tension at the core of the trump administrations increasingly hardnosed stance on russia the president instinctually opposes many of the punitive measures pushed by his cabinet that have crippled his ability to forge a close relationship with russian president vladimir putin the past month in particular has marked a major turning point in the administrations stance according to senior administration officials there have been mass expulsions of russian diplomats sanctions on oligarchs that have bled billions of dollars from russias already weak economy and for the first time a presidential tweet that criticized putin by name for backing syrian leader bashar alassad advertisement on friday night the united states acting with britain and france attacked assads chemical weapons facilities as punishment for what they say was his use of agents on civilians un ambassador nikki haley said sunday that the administration plans to announce additional sanctions against russia soon a white house spokesman stressed that trumps russia policy has been consistent and tough from his earliest days in office and that the president supports the recent moves while we would like to work with russia when faced with their malign activities on the international stage the president will hold them accountable raj shah said some close to trump say the recent measures are the product of an ongoing pressure campaign to push the president to take a more skeptical view of the russian leader advertisement if youre getting briefed by the cia director on all this stuff theres a point where even if youre donald j trump you think hmm putins a really bad guy said former house speaker newt gingrich an informal trump adviser others note trumps ongoing unease with his own policy even as his administration has ratcheted up the pressure on putins inner circle trump has continued in recent weeks to make overtures to the russian leader congratulating him on his election win and in a move that frustrated his national security team inviting him to visit the white house i think i could have a very good relationship with russia and with president putin trump said at a news conference just days after the largest expulsion of russians in us history and if i did that would be a great thing and theres also a possibility that wont happen who knows advertisement trump came to the white house believing that his personal relationships with other leaders would be central to solving the worlds thorniest foreign policy problems administration officials said in trumps mind no leader was more important or powerful than putin they said a cooperative relationship with the russian leader could help trump find solutions to problems that bedeviled his predecessor in places such as ukraine syria and north korea former president barack obama had a tense relationship with putin trump said he could do better but felt stymied by the media congress and special counsel robert s mueller iiis probe into russias interference in the election any conciliatory move he made toward putin came under heavy scrutiny when will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship is a good thing trump tweeted in november they are always playing politics bad for our country advertisement privately he complained to aides that the medias fixation on the mueller probe was hobbling his effort to woo putin i cant put on the charm the president often said according to one of his advisers im not able to be president because of this witch hunt as the months passed the presidents options for improving relations with russia narrowed in late july congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions on moscow that were widely seen as a rebuke of trumps efforts to reach out to putin it took aides four days to persuade trump to sign the bill which had cleared with a vetoproof majority trump advisers were reluctant to even raise the topic of russian interference in the election which trump equated with democrats efforts to undermine his victory its just kind of its own beast a senior national security official said its been a constant from day one advertisement gingrich and other trump advisers said cia director mike pompeo the secretary of state nominee was one of the few advisers who could address russia without raising the presidents ire in january pompeo told the bbc that he had every expectation that russia would make an effort to disrupt the midterm elections privately he pushed trump to take a tough line on moscow one area where aides worked to change trumps mind was on a proposal to sell antitank missiles to ukraine obama had opposed the move for fear of angering moscow and provoking a russian escalation trump initially was also hesitant to support the move which had the backing of the pentagon and state department he would say why is this our problem why not let the europeans deal with ukraine a us official said advertisement aides described a lobbying effort by pompeo haley and defense secretary jim mattis in support of the lethal aid i just want peace trump would say when pressed on ukraine his aides countered that the weapons would help achieve peace by deterring further russian aggression to bring the president around us officials argued that the million military aid package could be a boon to us taxpayers if cashstrapped kiev stabilized and someday became a reliable buyer of american military hardware to the surprise of even his closest advisers the president agreed late last year to the weapons transfer on the condition that the move be kept quiet and made without a formal news release aides tried to warn him that there was almost no way to stop the news from leaking when it broke russia hawks in congress praised the president another significant step in the right direction said sen john mccain rariz a frequent trump critic but trump was still furious an administration official said advertisement for some reason when it comes to russia he doesnt hear the praise a senior administration official said politically speaking the best thing for him to do is to be tough on that one issue he cannot hear the praise the poisoning in britain in early march of former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia with a nerve agent upped the tension between trump and his advisers initially the president was hesitant to believe the intelligence that russia was behind the attack a fact that some aides attributed to his contrarian personality and tendency to look for deeper conspiracies to persuade him his advisers warned that he would get hammered in the press if he was out of step with us allies officials said there was a sense that we couldnt be the only ones not to concede to reality the trump adviser said the next task was convincing trump that he should punish putin in coordination with the europeans why are you asking me to do this trump asked in a call with british prime minister theresa may according to a senior white house official whats germany going to do what about france he was insistent that the poisoning in the english city of salisbury was largely a european problem and that the allies should take the lead in moving against russia trump told aides in an oval office session on march that he was confident french president emmanuel macron would deliver on promises to expel russian officials but that he was worried about german chancellor angela merkel whose country depends on russian oil and gas the next day at his maralago resort trumps aides gave him the final memo with the precise number of american expulsions the president signed the order on the plane back to washington trump was furious as news reports described the expulsions as the largest purge in us history and noted the wide gap between the united states and its allies if you had told me france and germany were only doing four thats what we would have done one official recalled him saying some officials said it was a simple misunderstanding others blamed the presidents strained relationship with his top aides including hr mcmaster his former national security adviser anytime mcmaster came in with a recommendation he always thought it was too much the trump adviser said they were just oil and water on everything so his natural impulse was if this was your recommendation it must be too far in the days since the expulsions trump has continued to take tough new actions to punish russia early this month the administration sanctioned senior russian officials and seven oligarchs and their companies prompting russias foreign ministry to threaten a harsh response the sanctions were followed by an alleged chemical attack that killed dozens of syrians in the rebelheld town of douma east of syrias capital president putin russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad trump tweeted in his first byname criticism of the russian leader big price to pay the relatively modest airstrikes that trump ordered friday were designed to deter assad without provoking a broader military conflict with russia some european diplomats in washington question whether the tough moves have trumps full support this wouldnt be the policy unless trump supports it yes asked one ambassador russia analysts seem just as mystified this is a man who if he had his druthers would be pursuing a much more open and friendly policy with russia said angela stent a former white house official and professor at georgetown university the united states essentially has three russia policies the presidents the executive branchs and congresss less than a month after trump shocked his foreign policy advisers by inviting putin to the white house the prospects for a visit anytime soon seem remote no date has been set white house officials said were not rushing to do this meeting a senior administration official said our team wasnt thrilled about the idea julie tate contributed to this report giftoutline gift

https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/with-expulsions-of-russians-the-westen-masseconfronts-putin,11,11,in sweeping retaliation for russias growing aggression in the west the united states and nineteen other nations expelled more than a hundred and thirty russian intelligence officers and diplomats on monday the coördinated rebukegalvanized after moscows alleged assassination attempt on a former double agent living in britainis unprecedented since the cold war which ended more than a quarter century ago it sends a muscular message from the west to president vladimir putin that he cant attack one western country without generating a broad response from them all a western diplomat told me but it also signals the potential for a deeper confrontation that could ripple across other global flashpoints where western and russian interests compete the showdown also has serious implications for president trumps hopes of improving relations with putin whom he congratulated just last week on his reëlection to another sixyear term this is in many ways the end of an illusionthe illusion of some sort of grand bargain with putin under which trump has seemed to operate for so long william burns a former us ambassador to russia and now the president of the carnegie endowment for international peace told me further actions by the western alliance are also on the table a western diplomat told me today was a pretty extensive set of measures well see what russia does in response he said we and our allies are constantly talking to each other about how we deal with this strategic threat the locker is not empty the white house said that it had not ruled out sanctions against putin himself washington took the biggest step ordering sixty spiesfortyeight in washington and twelve in russias mission to the united nations all of whom had been operating under diplomatic coverto leave the country within seven days it also ordered the closure of russias consulate in seattle which is close to a us naval base and the headquarters of boeing on monday a sign on the consulate door said that it was no longer taking applications for passports or visas other nations from canada and croatia to spain and sweden also followed britains decision earlier this month to expel twentythree russians in all twentyone western nations have now ordered the ouster of a hundred and thirtyfive spies and diplomats the united states takes this action in conjunction with our nato allies and partners around the world in response to russias use of a militarygrade chemical weapon on the soil of the united kingdom the white house said in a statement in a briefing a senior administration official said that the actions make the united states safer by reducing russias ability to spy on americans and to conduct covert operations that threaten americas national security russia announced that it would respondin kind in washington where early on monday he was summoned to the state department for official notification the russian ambassador anatoly antonov called the expulsions provocative very little still remains in terms of russianamerican relations he told a russian news agency in a strange twist the russian embassy tweeted us administration ordered the closure of the russian consulate in seattle gkseattle what us consulate general would you close in russia if it was up to you to decide it offered options to check the us consulate in vladivostok yekaterinburg or st petersburg twitter content this content can also be viewed on the site it originates from in moscow the foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said on national television that britain had not provided any evidence to support allegations that russia had used novichok a lethal chemical weapon that has never been used on the battlefield to poison sergei skripal and his daughter yulia in the british cathedral city of salisbury tensions between the west and russia are likely to escalate at least in the short term in what could look like a cold war on steroids nina khrushcheva who is the granddaughter of the former soviet premier nikita khrushchev and who now teaches at the new school in new york told me putin is judoesque to the core of his being for him this is all a game whos he going to screw next he wants the upper hand he doesnt give up he doesnt stand back he sees an opening and strikes he punches ten times what he receives hes a brilliant tactician but a petty man weve seen that for all his eighteen years in power the danger down the road khrushcheva said is putin taking broader retaliationpulling out of international agreements complicating foreign businesses operations or expelling more diplomats and even foreign journalists we cant predict exactly she said seizing crimea may seem shortsighted from the rational point of view russia got a hit in international affairs but for putin it was a rise in russian patriotism the poisoning of skripal was shortsighted and the timing was badbefore the elections on march thbut given putins view that enemies traitors must be punished russia unlikely regrets it in essence from a position of bettering the country putin is always shortsighted but with his tactical victories he is always willing to say russia is going to be strong even if it means being punished by the west even going hungry others say that the diplomatic crisis could over time force russia to rethink its strategy it faces a growing economic morass troubling demographic trends the cost of foreign military interventions in crimea and syria and diminished international standing putin literally cant afford another cold war william taylor a former us ambassador to ukraine told me this is not the cuban missile crisis tom pickering a former us ambassador to russia and the un added but there are a lot of lessons from the cuba crisis that we should pay attention to such as overreaction overreliance on nuclear weapons talking about them as if theyre something anybody can use and a clear sense that unless adults are truly in charge of the relationship it can get worse without control he warned that the united states and its allies need a strategy with a combination of pushback and messaging through diplomatic channels at the highest level to find ways to avoid real peril at the moment its a game of chicken with no offramp pickering told me and we need to be looking at the offramp the new diplomatic démarche differs from previous rounds former us ambassadors who worked in both republican and democratic administrations say in december president obama unilaterally expelled thirtyfive russian diplomats for moscows meddling in the us presidential election seven months later in july moscow ordered us missions in russia to reduce their staffs by seven hundred and fiftyfive people the majority were russian nationals banned from employment in us missions at the time trump thanked russia for cutting back on the expense of keeping a larger us diplomatic presence in moscow the largest expulsion since the cold war ended in was the deportation of fifty russian diplomats after the arrest in of the fbi agent robert p hanssen who had spied for moscow for more than fifteen years it used to be expulsions were handled with a very precise decorum stephen sestanovich a former us ambassadoratlarge for the former soviet union told me this has a different look its not tit for tat youve got expulsions taking place in a kind of freeform way that is meant to send signals about the broader relationship the biggest difference in the new response to russia aggression is western unity which is significantly stronger than its response after the russian intervention in eastern ukraine or after a russian missile shot down malaysia

pregnancy coincidentally my friend the poet john hegley was in the same carriage i remember and we said goodbye and good luck at oxford where the train surrendered to rapidly worsening weather and the railway company bundled us into optimistic black cabs towards our respective onward destinations my son and i found ourselves sharing our ride through the suddenly siberian cotswolds with a groomed

this especially interesting nor were they engaged by my eloquent and delightful infant whose cherubic curls and indefatigable innocence created an angelic counterpoint to the black mood of the taxis interior i asked the russian what he thought of gay rights at home and of putin whom i found newly comical as he had recently been photographed wrestling a bear naked while shooting an assault rifle or something the russian explained forcefully that i needed to understand that there was a vodkafuelled crisis of manhood in russia and that putin was selflessly providing a role model to inspire the men of the nation the discussion was closed to me the pair seemed shrouded in shame as if they had committed a crime the presence of a chirruping child magnifying their corruption i think the kid

of a bad record of violating international law and misleading the international community russia he added cant take british words for granted he continued history shows that british statements must be

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/the-guardian-view-on-expelling-russian-diplomats-spies-and-collective-strength,64,59,whatever the balance of motives in the attempted murder of former russian spy sergei skripal and these may never be precisely ascertained one consideration is likely to have been key this is the weakness of the uk which decided against a strong response to the fatal poisoning of alexander litvinenko is planning its exit from the european union and is trying to manage a transatlantic relationship that looks less special than ever britain like other us allies must deal with an unreliable american president who has displayed extraordinary sympathy for his russian counterpart and whose campaign is under investigation for possible collusion with the kremlin yet more than western allies are ejecting over diplomats believed to be spies in what the prime minister called the biggest collective expulsion of russian intelligence officials in history it came days after eu leaders agreed that it was highly likely russia is responsible for the poisoning of mr skripal and his daughter yulia most strikingly the us is expelling russian diplomats including posted to the un headquarters in new york and closing the consulate in seattle donald trump is allowing his administration to take a decisive stance probably because he has been made to feel he has little choice even if he remains reluctant to criticise vladimir putin or acknowledge russian meddling in the us election these measures are in large part symbolic though they will likely damage russian intelligencegathering they do not cover those who are spying without diplomatic cover some of the countries involved are expelling a single official only half of the eus members are acting and there are notable omissions most glaringly austria which says it is a neutral country and wants to remain a bridgebuilder between east and west keeping communications channels open nonetheless the breadth of this response is much greater than might have been anticipated moscow has sought to fracture the west and undermine multilateralism this display of unity is to the credit of the prime minister and the foreign office who have achieved it despite the counterproductive posturing of the foreign and defence secretaries theresa mays foreign counterparts have proved more helpful despite the concerns that key players such as france might be reluctant to sign on the joint statement from the us uk germany and france saying there was no plausible alternative explanation for the poisoning was the turning point allies have acted from sensible national interest the collective message both indicates anger at russian actions targeting them in recent years such as cyberattacks and puts down a marker unleashing a chemical weapon on the streets of a city is hardly a marginal issue it crosses a line few would want to ignore the brazenness of moscows reaction further helped mrs may no measures are costfree these do close off already limited channels they may if anything bolster domestic support for mr putins claims that russia is ringed by hostility few in russia appear to believe that moscow was responsible and in any case they are far more preoccupied by the horrific fire in siberia they will doubtless be followed by titfortat expulsions and probably something more mr putin understands the power of asymmetric reactions but the west too has options in reserve a critical question will be whether they involve targeting the assets of mr putins oligarch friends there are complaints elsewhere that london even as it seeks support from allies is reluctant to pay too high a price for challenging moscow mr trump last week congratulated the russian president on his reelection against explicit advice and did not raise mr skripals case and prior to the poisoning a nameandshame list of corrupt russian oligarchs with ties to mr putin was replaced at the last minute with an allinclusive list of rich russians apparently cribbed from forbes maintaining any kind of unity of response in these circumstances will be extremely difficult but in a world of imperfect options this weeks measures have sent an important message

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/russia-tested-nerve-agent-on-door-handles-before-skripal-attack-uk-dossier-claims,66,61,russia had tested whether door handles could be used to deliver nerve agents and had targeted the email accounts of sergei and yulia skripal since at least according to previously classified intelligence over the salisbury attack that has been made public the uk released the intelligence on friday linking russia to the attack on the former double agent and his daughter the door handle and email claims were made in a letter from sir mark sedwill the uks national security adviser to the nato secretary general jens stoltenberg it is extremely rare for the uk to make such intelligence public in the letter sedwill who has an overview of the work of all british spy services filled in some of the intelligence that theresa may referred to when she made a house of commons statement saying russia was highly likely to have been behind the attack allow scribd content this article includes content provided by scribd we ask for your permission before anything is loaded as they may be using cookies and other technologies to view this content click allow and continue allow and continue in response the russian ambassador in london alexander yakovenko announced that the embassy would be publishing its own report on the attack the british government still hasnt produced any evidence in support of its position that would confirm their official version he told a press conference at which he showed footage of tony blair apologising for intelligence mistakes made in the runup to the iraq war we get the impression the british government is deliberately pursuing the policy of destroying all possible evidence in his nato letter sedwill said the nerve agent novichok had been developed at the russian research facility in shikhany as part of an offensive chemical weapons programme with the codename foliant sedwill said russia regarded at least some of its defectors as legitimate targets for assassination with the suggestion that they could include skripal a former member of the gru russian military intelligence who was convicted by russia of espionage in after working for mi we have information indicating russian intelligence service interest in the skripals dating back at least as far as when email accounts belonging to yulia skripal were targeted by gru cyber specialists sedwill wrote he also said during the s russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents and to train personnel from special units in the use of these weapons this programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents including by application to door handles within the last decade russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks under the same programme he said russia had continued developing small amounts of novichok over the past decade russias chemical weapons programme continued after the collapse of the soviet union by when russia signed the chemical weapons convention cwc it is likely that some novichoks had passed acceptance testing allowing their use by the russian military he said russias cwc declaration failed to report any work on novichoks russia further developed some novichoks after ratifying the convention in the mids president vladimir putin was closely involved in the russian chemical weapons programme it is highly unlikely that any former soviet republic other than russia pursued an offensive chemical weapons programme after independence it is unlikely that novichoks could be made and deployed by nonstate actors eg a criminal or terrorist group the decision to release the intelligence is partly in response to russias repeated denials that it is responsible for the attack and suggestions of alternative scenarios the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons which is linked to the united nations confirmed on thursday that a novichok nerve agent had been used in the salisbury attack sedwill wrote i would like to share with you andallies further information regarding our assessment that it is highly likely that the russian state was responsible for the salisbury attack only russia has the technical means operational experience and the motive the term highly likely is one commonly used by the intelligence agencies when they believe something is certain since they are unwilling to express that opinion without a caveat in case of error russia has a proven record of conducting statesponsored assassination sedwill said concluding there is no plausible alternative explanation as well as questioning the uks evidence the russian ambassador to london complained at the continued refusal of consular access to yulia skripal we are not allowed to see our citizens talk to doctors have no idea about the treatment the russian nationals receive he said we cannot be sure that yulias refusal to see us is genuine we have every reason to see such actions as the abduction of two russian nationals

behind the attempted murders downing street has publicly declined to say what action might be merited if any insisting that nothing can be decided while the police investigation is still ongoing but the meeting of the nsc which brings together senior ministers with intelligence and security officials among others is expected to see some ministers warn the prime minister that a tougher stance is needed than that seen after the poisoning of alexander litvinenko in london in the foreign secretary boris johnson who took a robust line on russia in the commons last week is understood to be pushing for strong action along with the defence secretary gavin williamson and the chancellor philip hammond a government source said the nsc meeting was expected to mark more concerted action over

restaurant where the russian spy sergei skripal may have been poisoned to wash their clothes and possessions has triggered concerns about the speed of official responses to the salisbury incident the advice from public health england phe released on sunday morning was aimed at as many as customers who ate at the zizzi restaurant or were in the mill pub in the centre of salisbury last sunday and monday the precautionary guidance reinforces suspicions that the nerve agent used on skripal and his daughter a week ago was first administered inside the restaurant traces of contamination have reportedly been found on and around the table where the two russians sat some of the furniture and other items are said to have been destroyed to prevent further poisonings scotland yard which is running the investigation would neither confirm or deny claims of contamination at the restaurant police activity was also visible at the nearby mill pub where traces of the substance have also been found the public health notice said that although the risk was very low repeated contact with clothing or items exposed to the nerve agent could still be a danger jenny harries phes regional director for the south of england told a press conference on sunday we have learned that there has been a limited contamination in both the mill pub and in zizzi restaurant in salisbury asked about the delay in issuing the notice harries insisted it had been done in a timely fashion once the contamination was known about quick guide timeline the poisoning of sergei and yulia skripal show pm police have confirmed that skripal and his daughter were in salisbury city centre by pm it is not known if they walked from his home or whether they drove or were driven in between pm and around pm skripal and his daughter strolled around salisbury and visited the zizzi restaurant on castle street and the nearby mill pub they are believed to have been in zizzi for about minutes from pm pm a cctv camera at snap fitness in market walk captured two people initially thought to be skripal and his daughter the woman appeared to be carrying a red handbag later it became clear the pair were probably not the russian and his daughter police have been keen to speak to the couple pm the same camera caught personal trainer freya church she turned left out of the gym and in front of her saw skripal and the woman on a bench at the maltings shopping centre she said the woman had passed out and the man was behaving strangely church walked on pm footage that emerged on friday from a local business showed that people were still strolling casually through market walk approx pm a member of the public dialled the friday footage shows an emergency vehicle racing through the pedestrianised arcade shortly after pm a paramedic also ran through police and paramedics worked on the couple at the scene for almost an hour in ordinary uniforms pm the woman was airlifted to hospital skripal was taken by road pm images taken by a passerby show that officers were still clearly unaware of the severity of the situation they did not have specialist protective clothing and members of the public also strolled nearby pm police told salisbury journal they were investigating a possible drugrelated incident at about this time officers identified skripal and his daughter and by sunday evening they were at his home in normal uniform or street clothes at some point ds nick bailey now seriously ill in hospital visited the skripal house but it is not known where he was contaminated approx pm officers donned protective suits to examine the bench and surrounding areas by pm officers were hosing themselves down it was not until the next day that a major incident was declared photograph ben stansallafp was this helpful thank you for your feedback we work with our colleagues here on a continuous riskassessment basis she said when we get new information we continuously riskassess groups of people who may have become exposed from the evidence we have in front of us as new evidence becomes available we act on that immediately harries said that most people who were at the pub would have already washed the clothes they were wearing anyone who suffered symptoms such as nausea or blurred vision was more likely to have flu than be a victim of chemical warfare she declined to reveal how the skripals had been given the nerve agent whether it was in powdered form in their food or dispersed as a liquid spray cara charlesbarks the chief executive of salisbury nhs foundation trust said the two russians remained in a critical but stable condition she added that ds nick bailey who was taken ill after attending the scene was in a serious but stable condition kier pritchard acting chief constable of wiltshire police said bailey was conscious and engaged with visitors the phe statement said while there is no immediate health risk to anyone who may have been in either of these locations it is possible but unlikely that any of the substance which has come into contact with clothing or belongings could still be present in minute amounts and therefore contaminate your skin over time repeated skin contact with contaminated items may pose a small risk to health it recommended reducing the risks in several ways the statement said wash the clothing that you were wearing in an ordinary machine using your regular detergent at the temperature recommended for the clothing any items which cannot be washed and which would normally be dry cleaned should be put in two plastic bags tied at the top and stored safely in your own home who is the salisbury spy sergei skripal video explainer wipe personal items such as phones handbags and other electronic items with cleansing or baby wipes and dispose of the wipes in the bin ordinary domestic waste disposal other items such as jewellery and spectacles which cannot go in the washing machine or be cleaned with cleansing or baby wipes should be handwashed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed with clean cold water skripal and his daughter ate in the restaurant hours before they were found unconscious last sunday on monday wiltshire police said the restaurant on castle street had been closed as a precaution and it remains cordoned off the home secretary amber rudd said police had identified more than witnesses and pieces of evidence the ministry of defence said armed forces personnel would return to salisbury to assist for a third day on sunday commenting on the latest development alastair hay professor emeritus of environmental toxicology at leeds university said the sites may reveal where the agent was administered it is important to note that nerve agents do degrade in the environment so you want to collect any evidence as soon as possible contact with moisture will lead to breakdown of the nerve agent this is why people having visited the restaurant or pub in question last sunday afternoon or monday are being advised to wash their possessions the advice to wash belongings is a precautionary measure if no one has had physical symptoms suggestive of nerve agent contact by now it is unlikely that they are a risk different nerve agents decay at different rates he added sarin breaks down more rapidly whereas vx is more persistent although the unusual nerve agent used in salisbury has been

http://observer.com/2018/04/british-spies-have-evidence-that-russia-poisoned-sergei-skripal/,79,72,when the histories of cold war are written the attempted assassination of sergei skripal on march of this year will appear as a turning point with that act of madcap aggression unleashing a militarygrade nerve agent in a provincial english city the kremlin made its lawlessness plain to see no longer was president vladimir putin making any effort to hide his regimes gangster nature with the failed hit on skripal and his daughter both of whom nearly died moscow signaled to the world that it could do whatever it liked there is a happy ending of sorts today after five weeks in the hospital much of it in intensive care yearold yulia skripal was released to continue her recovery at an undisclosed location better yet reports indicate that her father who was not expected to recover in fact is doing so at a faster rate than anticipated word in intelligence circles is that the skripals will be sent to the united states under assumed identities to live out the rest of their lives where the kremlin cant find them one hopes they are luckier than mikhail lesin it remains mysterious why the kremlin decided to murder a yearold former russian military intelligence officer and mole for british intelligence who had been traded to britain in giving no appearance of having much to do with espionage anymore skripal eschewed the lights of london for the quieterand he thought saferenglish countryside rumors that skripal became a target by getting involved in an investigation of cambridge analytica the seedy bigdata firm that has gotten itself in hot water over our election remain tantalizingly unconfirmed its even more mysterious why the kremlin chose such an unsubtle killing method as novichok a nerve agent invented by the soviet union in the sto say nothing of the assassins placing the lethal poison in a public place reportedly on skripals door handle in the middle of salisbury even for the putin regime which has previously used obscure poisons and radioactive agents to assassinate its exiled opponents in britain the skripal hit was extraordinary in its murderous cheek it didnt take long for the british government to assess that novichok had been used which was tantamount to the kremlin leaving a calling card at the crime scene to moscows unpleasant surprise the government of prime minister theresa may suddenly grew a backbone calling out the kremlin for its shockingly aggressive act in salisbury to putins astonishment may was able to get the backing of the european union and even president donald trump whose normal putinphilia was put on temporary hold as the united states joined in the unprecedented expulsions of russian diplomats in western countries by declaring russian spies personae non gratae and closing moscows consulate in seattle washington sent an indelible message true to form the kremlin reacted with hysterical denunciations of britain and the west its usual propaganda outlets such as rt and sputnik went into overdrive moscows position has veered among myriad ridiculous conspiracy theoriesthe attempted assassination was a british false flag operation andor it was really an american plot to abduct the skripalsbut the kremlins core position that poor innocent russia is the victim of sinister western malfeasance has stood firm as evidence of moscows hand behind the failed hit has mounted russias official media coverage has grown increasingly shrill and mythical whats significant however is that the sudden souring of relations with the west since march clearly took the kremlin wholly by surprise after getting away with so many outrageous crimes in the west especially in britain it seems not to have occurred to putin and his chekist retinue that there might be a limit somewhere to what london could tolerate with some shock then recently the kremlin has conceded that were in cold war to use the term i coined just over four years ago after putin stole crimea last week sergei naryshkin publicly accused the west of unprecedented hypocrisy in the skripal case to justify their hegemony he went on countering the inexistent russian threat has become fixation in washington its grown to such a scale and has acquired such silly features that we can speak about a return to the dark pages of the cold war since naryshkin isnt some obscure moscow functionary rather the head of russias foreign intelligence service this is an official kremlin pronouncement finally that cold war is upon us central to moscows disinformation about the skripal hit is the notion that london and washington are simply making things up to blame the blameless russians for how after all could prime minister may be so certain that the kremlin was behind the attempted assassination notwithstanding the use of a nerveagent that could only have come from russia to anyone versed in how highlevel highstakes diplomacy operates in the real world its obvious that london is in possession of solid intelligence to back up its claim of kremlin culpability in the march attack theresa mays insistence that russian intelligence is to blame for the attack on the skripals is the tell that the brits know something important behind the scenes the sort of highly classified information that cant be shared with the public but what finally we may have an answer to that vital question yesterday the express a british tabloid reported a bombshell british spies on cyprus had intercepted a series of secret kremlin messages that were related to the assassination on the day of the poisonings march one was sent from a location near damascus in syria to an official in moscow including the phrase the package has been delivered and saying that two individuals had made a successful egress this prompted a young flight lieutenant to recall a separate message that had been intercepted and discounted on the previous day furthermore according to the express the secret messages were forwarded to britain where government communications headquarters gchq britains nsa partner and equivalent realized their significance and forwarded them to prime minister may this explosive intelligence was also shared with the white house moreover these topsecret intercepts were but one piecealbeit a crucial oneof the classified information london possesses about what happened in salisbury so to break this down a british signals intelligence site in cyprus intercepted a series of secret messages between damascus and moscow that seemed to indicate russian foreknowledge and responsibility for what happened to sergei and yulia skripal but is any of this well true lets discuss what we can confirm first there really is a british sigint site in southern cyprus run by the british military for gchq which currently goes by the euphemism joint service signal unit cyprus it has been there since the early days of the last cold war and over the last few decades it has provided a lot of useful intelligence for both gchq and nsa second thanks to its location the cyprus sigint site has good access to intelligence targets in the eastern mediterranean so its interception of russian government communicationsin this case from one of russias many spy bases around damascusis inherently plausible indeed this is exactly the sort of highvalue intelligence that western sigint services look out for moreover its very common in the espionage trade to intercept information the importance of which only becomes clear a day or two after therefore we can conclude that the express story has a ring of truth to it and several friends inside the five eyes intelligence alliance have confirmed to me that it is true there are also hints that other western intelligence agencies intercepted russian communications relevant to the skripal hit and those likewise have been shared with london and washington british codebreakers are highly skilled and this would hardly be the first time that londons spies intercepted hushhush foreign communications that changed the world back in early royal navy codebreakers got their hands on a bombshell secret german diplomatic cableit would go down in history as the zimmermann telegramwhich got the united states into the first world war and altered the course of history these more recent cyprus intercepts may prove less earthshaking though the kremlins official admission that were in cold war surely looms as a major historical event yet again sigint has demonstrated why it has been the worlds most valuable intelligence source for more than a century john schindler is a security expert and former national security agency analyst

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/16/police-launch-inquiry-over-death-of-nikolai-glushkov,83,76,police have launched a murder investigation into the death of the russian businessman nikolai glushkov after a pathologist concluded he died from compression to the neck suggesting he may have been strangled by hand or ligature the metropolitan polices counterterrorism command is retaining its lead role in the investigation because of the associations mr glushkov is believed to have had but has cautioned that there was no suggestion of a link with the attempted murders of the russian former spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia in salisbury almost two weeks ago the political row between britain and russia was mounting after the russian foreign ministry said it was summoning the uk ambassador laurie bristow for a meeting on saturday russian news agencies reported at the time of his death glushkov was about to defend a claim against him by the russian airline aeroflot at the commercial court in london where he was accused of fraud in during a trial in absentia in russia he was sentenced to eight years in prison for stealing m from the airline which then pursued the case in london glushkov failed to show up at court in central london on monday and his body was discovered in southwest london that evening the met said detectives are retaining an open mind and are appealing for any information that will assist the investigation officers want to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious at or near his home in clarence avenue in new malden between sunday march and monday marchthe polices belief that glushkov was killed will increase scrutiny over the safety of russians in the uk and is likely to stoke tensions in an escalating diplomatic dispute over whether the kremlin played a role in the skripal attack which involved the nerve agent novichok on friday the foreign secretary boris johnson blamed the russian president vladimir putin for the attack telling an audience at the battle of britain museum in uxbridge we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his putins decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the uk on the streets of europe for the first time since the second world war putins spokesman dimitry peskov denounced the comment as a shocking and unforgivable breach of diplomatic rules of decent behaviour the two nations have already announced titfortat expulsions of diplomats including embassy staff in london at a meeting of european foreign ministers on monday johnson is expected to urge allies to clamp down on russian espionage and money laundering but will not table a barrage of new euwide economic measures against russia the german chancellor angela merkel played down the possibility of her country boycotting the football world cup in russia in june saying right now its important that theres an investigation a russian chemist who worked for years inside the secret military installation where novichok was developed told the guardian it was impossible that a nonstate actor could have been behind the poisoning vil mirzayanov said the agent was too dangerous for anyone but a highlevel senior scientist to handle and he did not see how a criminal organisation or other nonstate group could pull off such an attack its very very tough stuff he said from exile in new jersey i dont believe it the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw is now formally involved in the process of investigating the nerve agent that has left the skripals fighting for their lives and a police officer nick bailey seriously ill in a salisbury hospital downing street confirmed that a team of scientists from the opcw would come to the uk early next week the process is to be agreed between the opcw scientists and the lab at porton down which originally identified the agent under article of the chemical weapons convention the opcw team is expected to take its own samples that could be either environmental evidence from the skripal home their car or possibly the pub or restaurant that the pair visited or biomedical samples from the skripals themselves earlier the opcw said russia had not declared information about the existence of the novichok group of nerve agents possibly because stockpiles were thought to have been destroyed in a postsoviet clampdown on old chemical weapons there is no record of the novichok group of nerve agents having been declared by a state party the opcw said in a sign that the glushkov case is also becoming politicised russias investigative committee announced on friday that it had opened a murder investigation into the death in a statement released just hours before the scotland yard announcement the committee which handles highprofile cases said it would manage the investigation in accordance with the requirements of russian law it said investigators were ready to cooperate with british law enforcement the met stressed that at this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in salisbury nor any evidence that glushkov was poisoned police were called by the london ambulance service at pm on monday after the yearold was found dead at his home in new malden a special postmortem began on thursday in the s glushkov was a director of the state airline and of boris berezovskys logovaz car company in as berezovsky fell out with putin and fled to the uk glushkov was charged with money laundering and fraud he spent five years in jail and was freed in fearing further arrest he fled to the uk and was granted political asylum in he gave evidence in a court case brought by berezovsky against his fellow oligarch roman abramovich who remained on good terms with the kremlin glushkov told the court he had effectively been taken hostage by putins administration which wanted to put pressure on berezovsky to sell his stake in the tv station ort in march berezovsky was found dead at his exwifes home in berkshire police said they believed he had killed himself but a coroner recorded an open verdict the former world chess champion and russian opposition leader garry kasparov said he was not surprised glushkov was murdered i think this is a message addressed to russians with significant interests abroad who are thinking of cooperating with robert mueller the special counsel investigating alleged collusion with the trump administration its a preemptive strike tragically its not even about glushkov they pick someone who is expendable and recognisable he said speaking to the guardian in glushkov said he did not believe berezovsky took his own life im definite boris was killed i have quite different information from what is being published in the media he said he noted that a large number of russian exiles including berezovsky and alexander litvinenko had died under mysterious circumstances boris was strangled either he did it himself or with the help of someone but i dont believe it was suicide glushkov said too many deaths of russian émigrés have been happening

pair had been poisoned by russian agents trying to silence skripal a former russian intelligence officer who had been a double agent twentysix countries expelled more than russian diplomats in response to the poisoning according to current and former us officials the russians had violated one of the unwritten rules of espionage no assassinations especially not on another countrys soil one current official said there is a gentlemens agreement honor among thieves in which there are lines spies should not cross if a line is crossed the offended party can expel as pngs those diplomats it thinks may have some link to the violation people carrying luggage leave the russian embassy in london on march and board a van bearing diplomatic plates daniel lealolivas afp getty images file in addition to murder the official said offenses that have sparked past expulsions from western nations include internal political meddling like russias interference in the us election preparations for the outbreak of war acts of sabotage stealing or trying to steal a nations continuity of government plans ie how the top levels of government would react after a nuclear strike fbi mole robert hanssen gave the us plans to the russians and the us expelled russian diplomats after he was caught in the phrase itself png comes from the vienna convention an international treaty that defined rules for diplomatic relations article of the treaty says that without having to explain its decision the host nation can notify the sending state that any member of the diplomatic staff of the mission is persona non grata when the russians summoned us ambassador jon huntsman to the foreign ministry they were notifying the sending state that they planned to expel americans when the foreign ministry announced publicly that the americans had been chosen for expulsion for activities incompatible with diplomatic status they were calling them spies without giving details once declared persona non grataa diplomat must leave the country within a reasonable period or risk losing diplomatic immunity russian consulate in seattle lindsey wasson reuters the us expulsion of diplomats in march was the second such purge in less than months the obama administration had pnged diplomats in late in retaliation for russian cyber meddling in the us presidential election according to the current and former us officials in both cases the fbi and cia had previously identified the operatives and gave the list to policy makers who made the final decisions many of the russians who fill diplomatic positions in the us are actually operatives working for the countrys various intelligence services on tuesday state department spokesperson heather nauert said that the us gave russia the names of the pnged individuals after an interagency process that included the weighin of many us government partners like the fbi we believe our country is safer by making these russians go home said nauert we know that they were not here to do good but rather they could have done something potentially bad i think if you look at the actions that took place against the british citizen and his daughter its clear that perhaps our citizens were not safe this months expulsion also included the shuttering of a consulate in seattle the trump administration had shuttered the russian consulate in san francisco in and the obama administration shut russian recreation facilities in maryland and new york in december consulates and embassies can serve as hubs for human and electronic data collection say the officials the most recent purge said a current us official was meant to put a dent in russian spy operations both by creating chaos in russias us operations and limiting their geographic reach officials say that by closing the diplomatic and recreation complexes the administration has made it easier for the fbi to tail suspected agents in new york and washington the us had also been concerned that the seattle and san francisco consulates which are close to centers of the nations cyber industry had been used to gather info on us technology the effect of the expulsions however will probably not be longlived this may put a temporary dent in their capability said former acting cia director john mclaughlin now an nbc news analyst but russia is a national security state that puts great emphasis on espionage and deals with or brooks no public controversy about it they will replace their losses and we also have to factor in how many illegals they have here which i dont know even without accounting for illegals meaning agents who are not under diplomatic cover the expulsions actually leave a large complement of operatives behind the generally accepted number of russian spies operating undercover in usbased diplomatic facilities and at the united nations is meaning more remain in the us than were ejected those who were ousted meanwhile will be rapidly replaced they will try to replenish and they have a cushion to start with said dan hoffman a former cia russian expert and former cia moscow station chief mclaughlin thinks after a shortterm loss in skills and experience and ontheground street savvy the russians will be back up to speed in three to six months the current and former officials also say they dont expect the expulsions to deter russian president vladimir putins from aggressive actions the price has already been factored into his calculations he will gladly accept it said one current us official in return for what he got out of the election interference and the skripal poisoning a former official says putin may have even invited the reprisals as a way of proving he is the defender of fortress russia against the west and not everyone agrees with the strategy mclaughlin calls the expulsions a very cold war thing to do and thinks they are too reflexive and symmetrical richard haas the president of the council on foreign relations tweeted out his objections monday saying expulsions are less than optimal and will likely lead to moscow responding in kind meaning expulsions of us diplomats an accurate prediction of what occurred thursday haas suggested instead an asymmetrical response ie targeted economic and travel sanctions increased public diplomacy vs putin etc otherwise he suggested the costs will fall mainly on the us in the form of reduced capabilities in moscow and elsewhere inside russia hoffman agrees the us is likely to be hurt by ay titfortat response since russias authoritarian culture makes it far better able to restrict us intelligence operations in moscow he noted that the russians already make life miserable for us diplomats suspected of being spies even beating them up on the streets of moscow but he said he believes the us expulsions despite the russian response are the best alternative particularly if as president trump really wants a summit with the russian leader its the right message you want to deliver before a summit said hoffman that we are going to hold you responsible it had to be done you cant have a summit without doing it

nonsense still the poisoning and now the unexplained death have resurfaced talk of what many see as a pattern of russians who run afoul of the kremlin and later die under suspicious or criminal circumstances just two years ago the official report emerged about the death of mikhail lesin a former russian press minister and putin adviser whose death had originally been reported by russian media outlets as the result of a heart attack despite the fact that lesin had died in a hotel in washington dc and that his death was eventually ruled to have been caused by blunt force injuries the

emerge from the collapse of the soviet union berezovsky had been an early ally of putin but their relationship changed drastically culminating in the tycoon leaving russia and being locked in a multibilliondollar legal battle with another oligarch roman abramovich over proceeds from the sibneft oil company that dispute was eventually settled in abramovichs favor describing the suspicions around berezovskys death in the financial times reported he had after all long claimed president putin ordered the poisoning with radioactive polonium of one of berezovskys protégés alexander litvinenko the former kgb agent he was set to be a witness in a potentially explosive inquest in october into litvinenkos death glushkov refused to believe there had been no foul play in berezovskys demise particularly as it came years after the death of another ally the georgian billionaire badri patarkatsishvili who had died of an apparent heart attack in surrey you have the deaths of boris and badri over a short period of time too many bodies are happening i would say this is a little bit too much glushkov told the guardian in he added that the list of prominent russians who opposed putin was continuing to shrink i dont see anyone left on it apart from me berezovsky also controlled the aeroflot airline and glushkov ran it for him they were accused of embezzling from the enterprise and in a russian court ordered them to repay millions of dollars but by then berezovsky had moved to london glushkov wasnt as fortunate he served five years over money laundering and fraud the guardian

loosehanging jeans with his clarks shoe and liam gallagher style hair it took my breath away his manly beauty i would even say his aristocratic beauty seemed simply ideal to me i had neither the

recently appeared in playboy i dont know whether he was forced by someone to do this or was paid for it she said i dont want to blame anyone before i know that frankly speaking i dont think i want to go into finding out but its clear whoever organised this has definitely achieved his goal it made me so miserable it actually made me cry for the first time in a very long period so congratulations you have done it pictured former wife of alex chapman anna poses with a gun she was shocked and horrified when told by her new york lawyer that shots taken by mr chapman had been published while she

http://theconversation.com/russian-spy-attack-how-likely-is-a-british-cyber-offensive-against-putins-regime-93318,97,88,the tension between the uk and russia following the poisoning of former spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia has escalated with british prime minister theresa may indicating that a cyberattack could be one option of retaliation against the alleged involvement of vladimir putins regime serious concerns have been expressed about the potential risk to people living in the english city of salisbury who may have been exposed to the poison which the british government has confirmed is a sovietmanufactured militarygrade nerve agent known as novichok the prime minister recently told mps that extensive measures could be unleashed against russia if the country failed to offer up a clear explanation about the events surrounding the use of the nerve agent on the skripals but besides the sanctions and political manoeuvring which include the expulsion of russian diplomats there are other options on the table the conservative mp mark harper asked may on march will she confirm that if her majestys government conclude that there was unlawful use of force by the russian state we possess a considerable range of offensive cybercapabilities that we will not hesitate to deploy against that state if it is necessary to keep our country safe to which the prime minister responded we of course will look at responses across a number of areas of activity should it be that we conclude that this action does amount to an unlawful use of force by the russian state here in the uk a statesponsored cyberattack from the uk could lead to severe consequences for russias digital infrastructure which underpins its machinery generating propaganda and disinformation read more russian spy attack why britain is limited in how it responds to russia but its incredibly rare to hear such strong rhetoric from the british government in response to an incident in the full glare of public scrutiny as opposed to a covert espionage effort so is the uks official position on offensive cyber operations finally shifting given the history of information warfare the russians have been embroiled in such a vocal threat from mays government doesnt come as a complete surprise for over a decade now putins regime has been associated with an increasing weaponisation of the web from a fullblown botnet attack on estonias digital infrastructure in to notpetya a major malware attack that hit the globe just last year with the largest number of incidents being reported in ukraine britains possible cyber options russias statesupported media outlets and information portals are an obvious first target they have been known to spread hate and propaganda on social networks and provoke civil society into online malicious campaigns any such effort to nefariously propagate and magnify influence in cyberspace should be weakened any russian asset used to carry out intelligence espionage and cyber warfare operations from government websites to internet connectivity infrastructure could be deemed a legitimate target various parts of the dark web could also be potential targets for the uk it has been linked to russian mafia and organised gangs many of whom operate thriving criminal syndicates and have the backing of oligarchs who profit from cyber crime drug smuggling and human trafficking but challenges remain around the international laws that govern any declared targeted response and talks on the need for cybersecurity coordination on a global scale are only just emerging the tallinn manual a nonbinding consensus of legal experts on cyber operations merely suggests that targets should cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects its left open to wide interpretation meaning any choice of a target such as russia is problematic in a world where telecommunications and internet infrastructure is increasingly under joint public and private ownership cyber warfare if the uk were to respond to the skripal attack with an offensive cyber operation against russia it would ultimately serve as a blatant provocation in the current climate a retaliatory attack is highly plausible which has a real risk of escalation given possible hype around cyber warfare political rhetoric may get carried away but a sense of reality should prevail over the uks critical dependency on digital infrastructure be it from ordinary broadband access and mobile phone services to systems of critical and national importance including energy grids water treatment plants transport systems and healthcare in a welltimed if presumably coincidental announcement the uks ministry of defence recently said it was opening an academy to train military personnel to help them respond to cyber threats read more critical infrastructure firms face crackdown over poor cybersecurity mark lancaster who is the armed forces minister said cyber threats to the uk are constantly evolving and we take them very seriously thats why the defence cyber school is so important its a stateoftheart centre of excellence that will train more personnel across defence and wider government in dealing with emerging threats the ministers remarks came just four days after the nerve agent attack on sergei skripal and his daughter both of whom remain critically ill in hospital

handed over to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons investigation the uk says the russiandeveloped nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to vladimir putins government being behind the incident in salisbury on march this year russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are slanderous groundless and difficult to explain and has said that any stockpiles of novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties eu foreign ministers joint statement stopped short of directly blaming russia in the way the uk government has however only stating that the european union takes extremely seriously the uk governments assessment that it is highly likely that the russian federation is responsible foreign ministers were briefed by boris johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement european commission foreign affairs chief federica mogherini said arriving at the summit that the eu pledged full solidarity with the uk and said there was extreme concern about what happened the european union is shocked at the offensive use of any militarygrade nerve agent of a type developed by russia for the first time on european soil in over years the joint statement says the use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us

the uk and the international community and to provide immediate full and complete disclosure of its novichok programme to the opcw the european union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the uk

had been heartened by support for the uk and that britain was acting in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons in contrast he said to russia officials from the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons are arriving in the uk today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of sergei skripal and his daughter yulia he confirmed the british government says the substance is novichok a russiandeveloped weapon but russia has denied have any stockpiles of it the russian denials grow increasingly absurd at one time they

but some of them have mysteriously escaped to sweden the czech republic slovakia the united states or even the united kingdom he told reporters on the summit doorstep boris johnson addresses reporters in brussels ap i think what people can see is that this is a classic russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation what really strikes me talking to european friends and partners today is that years after the assassination of alexander litvinenko in london theyre not fooling anybody anymore there is scarcely a country around the table here in

months of disagreement and picked cia director mike pompeo to replace him video the washington post gift article share its another insane day at the white house giving us further proof that in the trump administration everything comes down to the president his hurt feelings his anger his demands for loyalty and his bizarre unwillingness to ever utter a discouraging word about russian president vladimir putin opinions to start the day in your inbox sign up arrowright today president trump announced he has ousted secretary of state rex tillerson and will nominate as his replacement cia director mike pompeo little by little were learning more about how the decision came down ashley parker philip rucker john hudson and carol d leonnig at the post bring us this reporting on how tillerson heard the news white house officials said that as tillerson traveled through africa last week white house chief of staff john f kelly called to wake him up in the wee hours there saturday to alert him that trump had decided to replace him kelley then suggested tillerson return to washington as soon as possible the story coming from the white house has changed over the course of the morning at first officials were saying that trump fired tillerson on friday while now we have the account of kellys call and in some versions kelly didnt actually tell tillerson he would be fired instead just warning him darkly that you may get a tweet advertisement then today the state department released a statement casting some doubt on whether its actually true that tillerson was fired on friday the secretary did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason it said follow paul waldman s opinions follow add and then early this afternoon peter alexander of nbc reported that the official who issued that statement undersecretary of state steve goldstein is being fired for contradicting the account of rex tillersons dismissal what other interesting thing happened recently that might help explain tillersons ouster on his way back to the united states either after he was fired or after he knew he was about to get fired but hadnt actually been fired yet tillerson told reporters that the recent poisoning in london of former russian spy sergei skripal was clearly the work of the russians a sentiment shared by the british government skripal had become a double agent for the british was caught and was eventually handed over in a spy swap advertisement this is not some kind of controversial opinion indeed the idea that russia wasnt behind skripals attempted murder is simply laughable on its face he was poisoned with an exotic chemical in a fashion plainly meant to draw maximum attention and make russian responsibility clear in order to send a deterrent message to anyone who might be thinking of crossing putin and yet trump and those who work for him are acting like it could have been russia but it could also have been the government of liechtenstein or a one direction splinter group were speaking with theresa may today trump said as soon as we get the facts straight if we agree with them we will condemn russia or whoever it may be heres a prediction the president will not be condemning russia but lets back up the firing of tillerson was hardly a surprise and many people have been expecting it ever since it was reported in october that tillerson had called trump a fing moron in a meeting with other administration officials which tillerson then refused to deny nobody likes to be called a moron of course but it had to have been particularly painful for someone as obviously insecure about their intellect as trump is and back in november the new york times reported that the white house had developed a plan to replace tillerson with pompeo advertisement but whats most notable is that tillerson wasnt fired because he has been eviscerating the state department crushing staff morale and leading to an exodus of experienced diplomats as dexter filkins of the new yorker wrote in november in only ten months tillerson the former ceo of exxonmobil has presided over the neardismantling of americas diplomatic corps chasing out hundreds of state department employees and scaling back the countrys engagement with the world that didnt seem to bother the president speaking today trump cited the fact that tillerson didnt want to tear up the iran nuclear agreement then he grew contemplative for whatever reason chemistry whatever it is why do people get along he asked ive always right from the beginning from day one ive gotten along well with mike pompeo president trump spoke march after it was announced he ousted secretary of state rex tillerson and planned to tap cia director mike pompeo to replace him video the washington post photo jabin botsfordthe washington post there were many reasons for his lack of rapport with tillerson but its hard to imagine that at a moment when trump feels so enormously threatened by the investigation of special counsel robert s mueller iii tillersons criticism of russia didnt play a role in the presidents thinking as anne gearan and carol morello of the post note advertisement tillerson emerged as one of the administrations strongest voices critical of russia for months he had been saying that russia clearly interfered in the us election even as trump shied away from any critical remarks so the fullest summary of tillersons service may be that he was a terrible secretary of state who was ultimately fired for his glimmers of sanity we can now add him to the long and growing list of top officials who have been booted or resigned just yesterday trumps body man was abruptly fired and escorted from the white house no doubt theres an interesting story there but what weve seen over and over is that incompetence or corruption is seldom what gets you shown the door in the trump administration instead you get fired when you disagree with the president or embarrass him that is if you havent already fled in a desperate attempt to save your reputation its not personal said michael corleone a strong leader who also struggled at times to retain his underlings loyalty its strictly business but when trump is president its always personal read more giftoutline gift article

is a very longstanding policy of governments never to confirm or deny whether someone is working for our intelligence services or not there are many reason for that not least of all the security of

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/03/13/if-russia-gets-away-with-using-chemical-weapons-in-britain-what-will-it-try-next/,132,24,gift article share by now it really should not come as much of a surprise that yet another russian has been attacked in britain opponents of russian president vladimir putin have been showing up dead in and around london for more than a decade in some cases the trail clearly leads back to moscow as with the use of such gruesome chemical agents as polonium alexander litvinenko in or in the most recent incident a nerve agent sergei skripal and his daughter who both survived the poisoning but remain in serious condition in other cases the evidence is subtler eg boris berezovsky found dead under suspicious circumstances in while britain is not the only place where those who have run afoul of putin have died a troublingly high number of such deaths have happened there we can quickly dispense with the blathering of russian officials about the latest case as just that blathering putins public policy plan for this type of thing can be summed up as lie bigger lie harder sooner or later the west will forget its a plan that often works why the russian government decided to make the attempt on skripal is not a difficult question news reports have indicated that skripal is a former russian intelligence officer who was sent to a russian prison in for selling state secrets to british intelligence he was freed in in exchange for russian intelligence officers arrested in the united states putin apparently decided to send a strong message to current and future members of the russian intelligence services if you cooperate with the west even if you end up living outside russia we will find you and kill you advertisement the use of poisons in attempted assassinations most likely performed by the russian external intelligence service the svr or possibly the military service the gru has an added psychological element in effect putin is saying not only will we find and kill you but we will do it in particularly gruesome fashion your family may also be targeted if youd like a glimpse of the agony putin is trying to impart to potential spies take a look at the online photographs from the last days in the life of litvinenko the fact that so many of these attacks have occurred on british soil puts prime minister theresa may and her government in a difficult position they are now well past the standard diplomatic response call in the russian ambassador express grave concerns and perhaps expel a number of russian personnel from the embassy in london which would almost certainly prompt a reciprocal expulsion of british diplomats from moscow london could also consider unilateral financial sanctions but the rub there is that given the amount of russian business and investment in britain this could significantly hurt british interests as well putin has shown himself to be an expert at understanding the difficulties open western societies have when it comes to punishing russia for illegal acts whether it is annexing part of another country as he did with crimea or having the russian intelligence services attempt assassinations on foreign soil putin has calculated that russia can weather any storm the west can come up with in response yes russia paid something of a price in sanctions after the annexation of crimea but not enough to really worry putin and his oligarchs who by and large simply pass the suffering along to the russian people the kremlin knows that eventually the sanctions will be lifted putin also knows that the west is not eager for direct military confrontation that leaves him with plenty of room to maneuver and yet a significant response is required this was a not only a russian attack on skripal but as may put it an illegal use of force that endangered scores if not hundreds of british citizens in their own country and it is clear that strongly worded messages are not the language putin understands best actions in these situations speak louder than words so what are the options advertisement if britain acts unilaterally its best response probably is economic finding a way to freeze or otherwise immobilize russian capital in the british financial system would be effective especially if a key group of russian oligarchs were targeted another measure could be to cancel british visas held by a list of russian oligarchs which might not hurt the russian economy that much but would send a strong message by upending the lives of a group of people putin does pay attention to hopefully there are creative statesmen and economists in london who can figure out methods to target the only real power group in moscow that could threaten putin his oligarchs but the west should also rally behind britain quickly publicly and unequivocally putin has been clever by using his intelligence services in this attack thus robbing nato and the united nations of a specific casus belli against russia yes using a militarygrade nerve agent that only russia could have produced does have a military element to it but this was not a fullon military attack against britain it has the deniability all russian active measures have still its not out of the question for nato to invoke article declaring that this attack didnt threaten just britain but all nato countries again though putin has probably already gamed this out it would be difficult to get all nato countries on board with this plan and after all was said and done what would it mean would nato launch a military attack that is unlikely there are other options the united states and the international community should consider they would be highly controversial but at some point our global structures must be used to punish horrific illegal behaviors by those who want to participate in the international system the first would be to consider banning official russian use of the swift international banking system this would have an immediate impact on putin his oligarchs and the russian economy in a more significant way than just economic sanctions russian officials have said in the past that such a measure would be tantamount to war an indicator of how seriously they would take the threat advertisement another option would be to at least raise the issue of suspending or removing russia from the un security council under the premise that a country that undertakes extraterritorial assassinations or illegally annexes parts of neighboring countries has forfeited its right to be on the council all these approaches have one thing in common they are fraught with difficulties and would test the resolve of western democracies which are divided along sociopolitical fissures the russians have worked hard to exacerbate president trump meanwhile said tuesday morning that as soon as we get the facts straight if we agree with the british assessment we will condemn russia or whoever it may be but if the west cant muster a serious response to the use of chemical weapons on british soil to target someone russian officials apparently viewed as a traitor for his work with british intelligence what else will putin try if not now under what circumstances would the west engage in serious measures designed to push back at putin what exactly would it take beyond international assassinations and illegal annexations to trigger a serious response to which the kremlin would pay attention putin has already engaged in actions that should outrage the international community what more will that same community let him get away with read more giftoutline gift article

further action against assad would have consequences its extremely difficult but the problem is nonintervention is also a policy with consequences he said iraq shows you intervention is extremely difficult but nonintervention as we see from syria is also extremely difficult he added if you say well suppose we do nothing then you really are giving carte blanche to the regime to do whatever is necessary to retake opposition areas by force the syrian government is winning the civil war in the country because their outside backers are prepared to intervene and to commit and frankly we have not been able now he said the attack in douma took place on saturday as syrian forces attempt to regain territory following the collapse of a ceasefire with the army of islam rebel group the assad regime denies that chemical weapons were used but videos shared on social media showed numerous dead children with foam on their mouths reports suggest medics treated more than people most of them women and children for symptoms including difficulty breathing foaming at the mouth and burning sensations in the eyes

requests for consular access in line with our obligations under international and domestic law including the rights and wishes of yulia skripal after the search of an aeroflot plane at heathrow russian officials warned they may take similar action against british airlines unless they receive an explanation the passenger jet was searched upon landing at heathrow following a scheduled flight from moscow according to the russian embassy in london the embassy suggested the plane had been searched in connection with the diplomatic crisis which has erupted following the salisbury spy poisoning it also claimed border force and customs officers at first tried to search the plane without the crew although the captain was eventually allowed to be present on saturday the russian ministry of transport said in a statement if there is no explanation the russian side will deem the actions towards our plane as illegal and also reserve the right to take similar action against british airlines the metropolitan police which is coordinating the investigation into the poisoning of sergei skripal and his daughter yulia said it was not part of the search securities minister ben wallace described the search as routine the russian embassy said it had complained to its british counterparts and called for an explanation we have witnessed another blatant provocation by the british authorities it said in a statement this kind of event is extraordinary moreover the british officials tried to search the aircraft without the crew being present something categorically prohibited by the rules in force our attempts to get in touch with the foreign office in order to clarify the reasons of the inappropriate behaviour of british officials did not bring fruit the embassy has sent a diplomatic note demanding the british side to provide explanations of the incident at this moment we have no other explanation but that the incident at heathrow is in one way or another connected with the hostile policy that the uk government is conducting with regard to russia the russian embassy has published a list of questions about the skripals which it claimed had gone unanswered by the british government many of the questions addressed the medical treatment the skripals received following the attack russian officials also said they had been in contact with mr skripals niece viktoria who would like to go to london and to visit her cousin yulia they called on british authorities to issue her visa without delay for humanitarian reasons uk news in pictures

i think the russians are being bloody minded and they are making a point but i am not quite sure what that point is other than they are going to demand this access whether that is to unnerve the skripals whether it is to play psychological games the russians love psychological warfare or whether there is another angle here i am not sure but this isnt just a standard request they will have thought about their options asked whether the foreign office should be considering russias request for consular access to ms skripal mr seely a former soldier who lived in russia in the s said i would be tempted to say no until both of them are in a state hopefully to decide whether they want to i certainly wouldnt be granting the russians access to the daughter without her consent if she doesnt want to then the answer is no otherwise i think it could be a very unnerving and unpleasant experience for her and shes still in a vulnerable state recommended russia refuses to back down in spy death row mr wallace said it is routine for the border force to search aircraft to protect the uk from organised crime and from those who attempt to bring harmful substances like drugs or firearms into the country once these checks were carried out the plane was allowed to carry on with its onward journey the kremlin has also ordered britain to withdraw more than diplomats from russia in retaliation for coordinated expulsions of moscows diplomats by nations around the world ambassadors from more than nations were called into the foreign ministry in moscow on friday to be told of the latest wave of retaliatory measures after dozens of countries this week banished russian diplomats alleged to have been undeclared intelligence agents the uk expelled russian diplomats in the wake of the poisoning of the skripals with a novichok nerve agent russia has already retaliated in kind against britain but said it would expel a little over in total to bring parity between the size of the countries diplomatic missions laurie bristow the uk ambassador in moscow was among those called into the foreign ministry he told reporters it is important to bear in mind why this crisis has arisen in the first place its the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of the united kingdom that has threatened the lives of a number of people in my country we asked certain questions of the russian state and have still not received adequate answers so far more than russian diplomats have been told to return home by the uks allies ms skripal who is a russian citizen spent three weeks in a critical

https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2018/03/economist-explains-10,151,24,the british prime minister theresa may said on march th that either the poisoning of a former russian spy and his daughter was a direct act by the russian state against britain or the russian government had lost control of its nerveagent programme sergei skripal was an officer in russias militaryintelligence services and for years a mole working secretly for britains mi in he was caught by the russians and jailed for years in he was released in a spy swap and settled in the british city of salisbury then on march th he and his daughter yulia were found on a bench in the city having been poisoned with a rare nerve agent they are still critically ill harsh measures against the kremlins critics are not unusual but under an informal understanding dating from the cold war spy agencies do not usually make physical attacks on the other sides intelligence officers especially after a spy swap mr skripal should have been offlimits so why was he made a target if mrs may is right then there are several possible explanations perhaps mr skripal had trodden on some toes in moscow by reentering the spying game or perhaps russia has chosen to mount a bold challenge to britain to highlight the hollowness of the governments tough talk about russia a third possibility is that the russian president vladimir putin wants to send a message both at home and abroad about russian power or someone within the russian system has done this without mr putins direct involvement foreign counterintelligence services have long been worried about a growing overlap between russian spy agencies and organised crime as mrs may pointed out the use of a nerve agent suggests government rather than criminal involvement but even in official circles there is now a blurred distinction between acts carried out directly by the russian state and those carried out by people acting in its name impunity is often now interpreted as an instruction russia denies any involvement in the affair but mrs may said her decision to point the finger at moscow was based on its record of conducting statesponsored assassinations and our assessment that russia views some defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations she said britain must stand ready to take much more extensive measures mrs mays tough response may be a result of the criticism she received as home secretary for not having taken stronger measures when the kremlin was implicated in the murder of alexander litvinenko a defector from the russian security services who was poisoned with polonium in london in a number of other exiled russians have died in mysterious circumstances in britain a huge investigation is now under way about what happened to mr skripal and the eastwest spy war could be entering new territory mrs may said that if there was no credible response from russia by the end of march th britain would conclude there had been the unlawful use of force britain is already sounding out its allies about a coordinated expulsion of russian intelligence officers based at diplomatic missions in the west and visa bans on the many senior russians with a background in the intelligence services financial sanctions against the assets of kremlin cronies are also under discussion whatever happens britain will need to boost its spycatching efforts if the kremlin is really willing to conduct reckless assassinations in western countries it is not only intelligence veterans who will feel nervous about their safety the stark certainties of the coldwar spy world have given way to a new landscape murky and in some ways more dangerous

responded by expelling us diplomats in a statement thursday russias foreign ministry said that based on the principle of reciprocity the americans in moscow and yekaterinburg were declared persona non grata for activities incompatible with diplomatic status the americans have to leave the country before april persona non grata is the same term the us uses when it expels diplomats national security types call the expulsions pnging from the initials so how do the us and the russians decide which diplomats to kick out and does it have any impact experts consulted by nbc news say the russian diplomats who were expelled from the us were really spies for the most part and pnging dozens of them is more than symbolic it has an immediate if shortterm effect on the ability of russia to collect intelligence inside the us earlier this month sergei skripal and his daughter were poisoned by nerve gas in the southwestern english city of salisbury british authorities immediately suspected the pair had been poisoned by russian agents trying to silence skripal a former russian intelligence officer who had been a double agent twentysix countries expelled more than russian diplomats in response to the poisoning according to current and former us officials the russians had violated one of the unwritten rules of espionage no assassinations especially not on another countrys soil one current official said there is a gentlemens agreement honor among thieves in which there are lines spies should not cross if a line is crossed the offended party can expel as pngs those diplomats it thinks may have some link to the violation people carrying luggage leave the russian embassy in london on march and board a van bearing diplomatic plates daniel lealolivas afp getty images file in addition to murder the official said offenses that have sparked past expulsions from western nations include internal political meddling like russias interference in the us election preparations for the outbreak of war acts of sabotage stealing or trying to steal a nations continuity of government plans ie how the top levels of government would react after a nuclear strike fbi mole robert hanssen gave the us plans to the russians and the us expelled russian diplomats after he was caught in the phrase itself png comes from the vienna convention an international treaty that defined rules for diplomatic relations article of the treaty says that without having to explain its decision the host nation can notify the sending state that any member of the diplomatic staff of the mission is persona non grata when the russians summoned us ambassador jon huntsman to the foreign ministry they were notifying the sending state that they planned to expel americans when the foreign ministry announced publicly that the americans had been chosen for expulsion for activities incompatible with diplomatic status they were calling them spies without giving details once declared persona non grataa diplomat must leave the country within a reasonable period or risk losing diplomatic immunity russian consulate in seattle lindsey wasson reuters the us expulsion of diplomats in march was the second such purge in less than months the obama administration had pnged diplomats in late in retaliation for russian cyber meddling in the us presidential election according to the current and former us officials in both cases the fbi and cia had previously identified the operatives and gave the list to policy makers who made the final decisions many of the russians who fill diplomatic positions in the us are actually operatives working for the countrys various intelligence services on tuesday state department spokesperson heather nauert said that the us gave russia the names of the pnged individuals after an interagency process that included the weighin of many us government partners like the fbi we believe our country is safer by making these russians go home said nauert we know that they were not here to do good but rather they could have done something potentially bad i think if you look at the actions that took place against the british citizen and his daughter its clear that perhaps our citizens were not safe this months expulsion also included the shuttering of a consulate in seattle the trump administration had shuttered the russian consulate in san francisco in and the obama administration shut russian recreation facilities in maryland and new york in december consulates and embassies can serve as hubs for human and electronic data collection say the officials the most recent purge said a current us official was meant to put a dent in russian spy operations both by creating chaos in russias us operations and limiting their geographic reach officials say that by closing the diplomatic and recreation complexes the administration has made it easier for the fbi to tail suspected agents in new york and washington the us had also been concerned that the seattle and san francisco consulates which are close to centers of the nations cyber industry had been used to gather info on us technology the effect of the expulsions however will probably not be longlived this may put a temporary dent in their capability said former acting cia director john mclaughlin now an nbc news analyst but russia is a national security state that puts great emphasis on espionage and deals with or brooks no public controversy about it they will replace their losses and we also have to factor in how many illegals they have here which i dont know even without accounting for illegals meaning agents who are not under diplomatic cover the expulsions actually leave a large complement of operatives behind the generally accepted number of russian spies operating undercover in usbased diplomatic facilities and at the united nations is meaning more remain in the us than were ejected those who were ousted meanwhile will be rapidly replaced they will try to replenish and they have a cushion to start with said dan hoffman a former cia russian expert and former cia moscow station chief mclaughlin thinks after a shortterm loss in skills and experience and ontheground street savvy the russians will be back up to speed in three to six months the current and former officials also say they dont expect the expulsions to deter russian president vladimir putins from aggressive actions the price has already been factored into his calculations he will gladly accept it said one current us official in return for what he got out of the election interference and the skripal poisoning a former official says putin may have even invited the reprisals as a way of proving he is the defender of fortress russia against the west and not everyone agrees with the strategy mclaughlin calls the expulsions a very cold war thing to do and thinks they are too reflexive and symmetrical richard haas the president of the council on foreign relations tweeted out his objections monday saying expulsions are less than optimal and will likely lead to moscow responding in kind meaning expulsions of us diplomats an accurate prediction of what occurred thursday haas suggested instead an asymmetrical response ie targeted economic and travel sanctions increased public diplomacy vs putin etc otherwise he suggested the costs will fall mainly on the us in the form of reduced capabilities in moscow and elsewhere inside russia hoffman agrees the us is likely to be hurt by ay titfortat response since russias authoritarian culture makes it far better able to restrict us intelligence operations in moscow he noted that the russians already make life miserable for us diplomats suspected of being spies even beating them up on the streets of moscow but he said he believes the us expulsions despite the russian response are the best alternative particularly if as president trump really wants a summit with the russian leader its the right message you want to deliver before a summit said hoffman that we are going to hold you responsible it had to be done you cant have a summit without doing it

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/10/yulia-skripal-discharged-from-hospital-salisbury-attack-nerve-agent,154,134,yulia skripal the daughter of the former russian spy sergei skripal has been discharged from hospital doctors have said just over a month after she and her father were found collapsed on a park bench in salisbury wiltshire after being poisoned with a nerve agent medics confirmed she had left salisbury district hospital skripal flew to the uk on march the day before she and her father are believed to have been poisoned with the nerve agent novichok she released a statement on friday saying her strength was growing daily sergei skripal is also making good progress and doctors hope he will be able to leave hospital in due course quick guide what is novichok show novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the soviet union in the s and s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons like other nerve agents they are organophosphate compounds but the chemicals used to make them and their final structures are considered classified in the uk the us and other countries the most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than vx the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents which include sarin tabun and soman novichok agents work in a similar way by massively overstimulating muscles and glands treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents namely with atropine diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes the chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in by vil mirzayanov a former russian scientist living in the us but the structures have never been publicly confirmed it is thought they can be made in different forms including as a dust aerosol the novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal after mixing two otherwise harmless components according to mirzayanov they are to times more toxic than conventional nerve agents photograph matt cardygetty images europe was this helpful thank you for your feedback speaking outside the hospital on tuesday its medical director christine blanshard said we have now discharged yulia from salisbury district hospital yulia has asked for privacy from the media and i want to reiterate her request i also want to take this opportunity to wish yulia well this is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone her father has also made good progress on friday i announced he was no longer in a critical condition although he is recovering more slowly than yulia we hope that he too will be able to leave hospital in due course blanshard gave further insight into how the nerve agent attacked the two patients and the treatment they received in the four weeks since the incident in the city centre both have received roundtheclock care from our clinicians who have been able to draw on advice and support from worldleading experts in the field she said nerve agents work by attaching themselves to the particular enzymes in the body which then stop the nerves from functioning this results in symptoms such as sickness and hallucinations our job in treating the patients is to stabilise them ensuring that they can breathe and blood can continue to circulate we then need to use a variety of different drugs to support the patients until they could create more enzymes to replace those affected by the poisoning we also use specialised decontamination techniques to remove any residual toxins both patients have been responding exceptionally well to the treatment weve been providing but equally both patients are at different stages of their recovery yulia skripals departure from hospital comes nearly three weeks after ds nick bailey was discharged after he was affected by the nerve agent the testimony of the skripals will be crucial in establishing the credibility of the governments claim that it was highly likely the russian state targeted them with the nerve agent moscow has waged a furious media battle in an attempt to discredit this account it is likely it will want to bring yulia skripal back to russia in its first response to the latest news the russian embassy in london tweeted its congratulations to yulia skripal but suggested she could be acting under duress we congratulate yulia skripal on her recovery yet we need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will russian embassy uk april the embassy then went on to suggest the skripals pet dogs had been burned as part of wider attempts by the uk authorities to destroy evidence skripal pets starved to death and corpses burnt bench where the victims were found removed plans about pulling down their home and even restaurants visited uk is destroying important and valuable evidence pictwittercomjouxuncy russian embassy uk april responding to reports that the skripals may ultimately be granted settled status in other countries such as the us or australia the embassy said such a move would be seen as an abduction secret resettlement of mr and ms skripal barred from any contact with their family will be seen as an abduction or at least as their forced isolation pictwittercomowdtni russian embassy uk april asked for her reaction to the news theresa may said well obviously i welcome the fact that yulia skripal has been discharged from hospital and i wish her the best for her continuing recovery and id like to say a huge thank you to all the staff at the hospital in salisbury who have looked after her and her father so well the russian and british governments have continued their war of words over who is to blame for the skripals poisoning on sunday boris johnson accused the kremlin and russias stateowned media of inventing different theories about the salisbury attack no other government devotes as much time and effort to the business of trying to sabotage or discredit international inquiries the foreign secretary said officials rejected

to our objectives you end up being led by events our track record of understanding events on the ground and the consequences of those actions has been poor the uk pms request for more evidence during private phone calls with the us president reported by the times is seemingly a contrast to the public broadcasts she has made along with her top government officials may has made clear who she suspects bears the guilt for the alleged chemical atrocity in douma syria on saturday pointing the finger at president bashar assad aided by russia on wednesday may told reporters in birmingham all the indications are that the syrian regime was responsible and well be working with our closest allies to consider how we can ensure that those responsible are held to account guarded in private but preparing for the likelihood of war in the public sphere may seems to want to have her cake and eat it the pm appears to be allowed to play by a different rulebook to that of the labour leader jeremy corbyn when it comes to foreign policy and national security issues especially when a country such as russia is involved it continues a theme over the last few months where corbyn has been lambasted for his responses even though he has been consistent on both the skripal poisoning case and now the alleged syrian chemical weapons attack on both events corbyn has called for full investigations refraining from apportioning blame or threatening any state or individuals with retaliatory action before clear evidence has been ascertained and international law has been seen through on the skripal incident corbyn said there must be a thorough investigation into these shocking events we need to see both the evidence and a full account from the russian authorities in light of the emerging facts you might have thought this coolheaded response would receive widespread approval especially when the threat of war looms large however thats not the case when it comes to certain parts of the media tory mps and even some of his own labour mps it is lamentable that jeremy corbyn is now playing russias game and trying to discredit the uk over salisbury attack lets remember the key facts boris johnson april jeremy corbyn refuses again to condemn russia over sergei skripal poisoning instead calling for dialogue with vladimir putin sun politics march on the alleged attack in douma corbyn struck a similar tone the horrific deaths and injuries in douma point to a chemical attack which must be fully investigated by the un and those responsible held to account the need to restart real negotiations for peace and a political settlement in syria could not be more urgent the horrific deaths and injuries in douma point to a chemical attack which must be fully investigated by the un and those responsible held to account the need to restart real negotiations for peace and a political settlement in syria could not be more urgent jeremy corbyn april again how is this any different to what theresa may is reportedly calling for in a private call to the us president in addition labours official statement reaffirmed corbyns position calling for a full and independent investigation of the reported attack and that anyone found responsible for using chemical weapons is brought to justice it added the syrian people have suffered too long from the atrocities and brutality of war whether committed by the assad regime by jihadist militias or by their respective international supporters the response from tory ministers such as mp sajid javid was derision this uklabour press release could have been written by the kremlin no mention at all of russian and iranian complicity wonder whyhow did a once great political party come to this sajid javid april the question for javid and others of his ilk is this where is your derision now for may your contempt for her not explicitly broadcasting to the world who the perpetrators of saturdays alleged atrocity in douma are and the affirmative action to be taken is nowhere to be seen theresa may and her government apparently do not require a full investigation to take place so that clear evidence can be provided regarding the skripal poisoning case yet the same protagonists are reportedly applying different laws of examination when it comes to syria corbyn is fast becoming theresa mays virtual phone a friend in times of international crisis even if she doesnt know it first they came to steal his domestic policies now it looks like the tories are trying to imitate his international diplomacy skills with calls of we want evidence first whatever next advice on the best root vegetable to grow in their allotments like this story share it with a friend

thank you for your feedback it came after moscow officials described the suggestions that the skripals could have been targeted by kremlin hitmen as part of an attempt to demonise russia this is pure propaganda and the pure whippingup of hysterical outbursts and hysteria said sergei lavrov the foreign minister however sir andrew wood the british ambassador to russia from to said that he had no doubt that the attack using a nerve agent available only to a few countries had been sanctioned from within russia although probably not directly by putin its a terrible thing to have done wood said its typical of the state that russia is in and its very hard to see what profit they can get from this it advertises the fact that they are vindictive and dedicated to pursuing revenge he called for the british government to seek a coordinated response we should look at how we do or dont implement the magnitsky act talk to our transatlantic allies and those in europe its just as much an attack on them as us the magnitsky act named after a lawyer turned whistleblower who died in prison after helping expose the same moneylaundering scheme identified by perepilichnyy would give the uk government the right to freeze assets and prevent the entry of people associated with human rights abuses and corruption westminster is understood to think that the uk gains few benefits from good relations with putin and boris johnsons visit to moscow was not deemed a success in salisbury police and military personnel continued to gather forensic evidence at several sites visited by the skripals and removed a couple of ambulances and a police car forensic teams also continued to examine the graves of skripals son and wife it is understood that there has been no application to the ministry of justice to have the graves exhumed indicating that either police do not have anything to substantiate suggestions that either died by foul means or they believe such a move would not currently help their investigation late on saturday the bbc reported that it understood traces of the nerve agent used against the skripals had been discovered at the zizzi restaurant where they ate just hours before collapsing on a park bench in salisbury the report also said nobody else in the restaurant at the time would have been in any danger a spokesperson for the metropolitan police which is leading the investigation refused to comment on the report ds nick bailey the officer taken ill after attending the scene and who is now recovering released a statement earlier in the day saying he does not consider himself a hero and was merely doing his job bailey visited the salisbury home of skripal after he and yulia were found slumped on a bench in the city centre investigators want to know if he was contaminated during that visit or whether he visited the scene where they were found and was poisoned there or by items there sources say that it is believed to be more likely that bailey became

in magnitsky had been investigating allegations of fraud involving russian officials and police browder believes the work he does has put him at the top of putins hitlist ive been threatened with death ive been threatened with all sorts of other things he says russia has denied involvement in the nerve agent attack on wednesday canadas foreign affairs minister chrystia freeland condemned the attack saying in a press release that canada stands in solidarity with its close ally the united kingdom and the british people the current asked for an interview with a representative of the russian embassy which was declined we regret the canadian foreign ministers hasty support for the unfounded and unacceptable accusations on the part of the uk with regard to the skripal case the embassy said in a written statement the british blame game is based on the word likely but not on trustworthy investigation hard facts and proper international procedures is highly reprehensible and extremely counterproductive browder says that putin is basically in the business of publicly lying about everything here we have a case thats pretty obvious there was an enemy of russia somebody attempted to assassinate him using highgrade military nerve agents which effectively only the russians possess just connect the dots there its not so hard to figure out sergei magnitsky died in police custody in moscow in alexander zemlianichenkoassociated press find the evidence the allegations against russia are not that easy to prove argues janice stein an international relations expert you need evidence at every step in the chain says stein who is founding director of the munk school of global affairs at the university of toronto yes this is a nerve agent which only the russian government developed years ago but its not impossible its not likely but its not impossible that a rogue agent got hold of some of it stein says that before mays government can make a move like seizing russian assets in the uk they would need incontrovertible proof of russias involvement in skripals poisoning now thats really difficult to do she says adding that the challenges that lie ahead will fall to the international intelligence community what can they find who was part of what we would call the supply chain how did this nerve agent actually get to britain she asks stein notes that there were about people who also became sick from the nerve agent in addition to the two people who are fighting for their lives protecting the public and stopping something like this from happening again could be difficult she says as the tactics of aggression change what the russian government has turned to over the last several years is belowtheradar warfare she says its doing this with information warfare

https://www.rt.com/uk/421436-skripal-skepticism-salisbury-novichok/,174,150,one of the striking things about the furor over the poisoning of exspy sergei skripal and his daughter is the lack of skepticism in britain at the evidence presented in what are still the very early stages of the investigation it may be a sign of the public mood or at least the mood of the people in power and the commentariat that not only have they rushed to judgment in mass groupthink but they also turn viciously on anyone attempting to express skepticism it is of course understandable that the response to a nerve agent being used to poison two people in a small provincial city is an emotional one but when the allegations being made are so serious what is the value of one mp after another standing up in parliament to deliver churchillian declarations of defiance before a suspect has even been identified labour leader jeremy corbyn stood in parliament and posed a series of questions has the prime minister taken necessary steps under the chemical weapons convention to make a formal request for evidence from russian government under article has highresolution trace analysis been run on a sample of the nerve agent that revealed any evidence as to the location of its production or identity of its perpetrators he went on and while suspending highlevel contacts does the prime minister agree it is essential to maintain a robust dialogue with russia corbyns request for further details on the evidence united the british parliament against him from the jeering tories opposite to his own angry backbenchers there was uncontained anger at his request to clarify exactly what is currently known about events in salisbury if the consensus is such that the leader of the oppositions attempt to propose some kind of opposing viewpoint is shouted down shouldnt that cause at least some pause for thought the british parliament has seen this kind of consensus before the voices of dissent were drowned out it didnt end well and the evidence was wrong on thursday writing in the guardian corbyn warned against a mccarthyite intolerance of dissent he warned prime minister theresa may not to run ahead of the evidence if there was any doubt that cool heads are in short supply in british politics currently the defense secretary has told russia to go away and shut up thats the diplomacy of a petulant teenager if you dig down into the initial accusations over russias involvement in the alleged deployment of the novichok nerve agent there was at least some skepticism theresa may offered two possible scenarios that the russian government ordered an attack or that it lost control of its stock of nerve agents this suggests that on monday the british government didnt know what had happened but because russia didnt use an arbitrary deadline to make an admission of guilt that was taken as evidence of culpability there was no material change in the publicly available facts but there was a public consensus simply putin did it any evidence of russian guilt at this stage is circumstantial the police still have no definite suspect but there is percent conviction in britain that the kremlin was to blame no questions asked britains allies have been more guarded generally falling in behind the corbyn view in suggesting more evidence is needed before conclusions are made even the joint statement on thursday from the uk france germany and the united states pointing the finger at moscow couches its accusations in uncertain terms it says britain believes it was highly likely russia was responsible thats skepticism its small but its there read more france germany us uk say salisbury incident a violation of uks territorial integrity by russia reuters has even picked up a story showing that in the mids a similar nerve agent was used to kill a banker in russia the person found guilty then was a scientist who had sold the substance to supplement his wages so there are other possible explanations that deserve at least a little time to be considered in britain though politicians and the media have become a single mass of expertise on russia all with deep insights into the workings of the kremlin theres little doubt among them among the theories being expressed with such certainty are that putin did this to boost his election campaign or its a warning to other spies or perhaps even its an attempt to destabilize britain during a period of political turmoil of course theres no real proof of any of this and the vast majority of these kremlin experts will be experts on brexit next week and last week they were experts on north korea when two world powers are heading towards a serious diplomatic crisis a lack of skepticism is dangerous and a baying mob driven by consensus could have serious consequences the times on thursday ran an opinion piece calling for russia to be punished through the targeting of russian children in british schools thats where the level of discourse currently stands think your friends would be interested share this story by simon rite rt

fellowes period soap opera we all scoff at the idea of a weekend just as dame maggie the dowager countess does we all have someone to do our ironing and live in stately homes with at least bedrooms in recent weeks i have been reminded of this conversation because just as false myths of britons are peddled abroad russians in the uk have found themselves cast in a reallife mcmafia where they are suspected of carrying a stash of nerve gas with them at all times in case they pass an italian restaurant where they dont like the look of someone superficially this stereotyping is funny until suddenly its not a russian friend interviewed for a british newspaper soon after the salisbury poisoning found herself painstakingly explaining that not all russians are oligarchs andor spies there are probably about a hundred people you could call oligarchs she thought maybe a few more you could call topclass spies and yet there are around million people you could call russian russians are no more likely to say own a multibilliondollar aluminium conglomerate or work for the security services than anyone of any other nationality it just seems that way in much the same way that it might seem to some people that british life is just like downton abbey when your countrys leader is both very similar to an oligarch and used to be a member of the security services its easy to see people might get confused but vladimir putin is not russia and russia is not putin as mikhail zygar formerly the editor of russias only independent tv channel dozhd wrote last week putin is part of a statesponsored project to establish him as a unique historical leader of russia able to unite fervent advocates of the communistera soviet union with those who dream of russias prerevolutionary empire built on orthodox christianity that is a mission that involves extreme cognitive dissonance and that kind of rewriting of history depends on finding as many common causes and common enemies as possible all the russian electorate took away from the events of this month was the uk has threatened russia those of us outside russia have to be careful we dont collude with this thinking over the past weeks ive been reading a flood of social media posts by russians deeply upset at being portrayed as robotic ultranationalists hellbent on poloniumpoisoning the world into submission they find this laughable and ridiculous but also insulting a friend was asked in all seriousness is this what russians do when they argue poison each other russians at home and abroad resent the fact that people cant seem to distinguish between russia and the security services and when relations become so tinged with resentment and conspiracy theories anything that falls outside the political sphere becomes problematic maybe this narrative even causes us to lose our humanity a little the poisoning of a spy is headline news as are this weeks expulsions of diplomats by the us and eu yet a tragic fire in a shopping centre in siberia with more than people dead wont make the front page meanwhile the kind of nuancefree russophobia represented by the response to the skripal case plays directly into putins hands the exiled oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky recently said that no one in russia had ever heard of sergei skripal apart from a narrow circle of people involved in special services all the russian electorate took away from the events of this month was the uk has threatened russia its all as a soviettrained brain would want it citizen against citizen hunting for traitors in a phony war its the sort of messaging that led to the closure of the british council in moscow last week and is now shutting down cultural exchanges between russia and the rest of the world similarly in response to the cambridge analytica storm the academic at the centre of the data harvesting aleksandr kogan laughed at suggestions that the fact he worked with st petersburg university made him a suspicious character anyone who knows me knows im a very happygolucky goofy guy the last one to have any real links to espionage but again this is just what putin wants us to think that all russian institutions are allpowerful and interconnected and ready to pounce with novichok in a heartbeat this was the myth that kept the soviet union alive when all the time chernobyl was waiting to explode not because of strategy and guile but because it was poorly designed and inadequately maintained when you see putin flexing his pecs or unveiling a presentation about nuclear warheads look for the weakness the show of strength is hiding keep in mind the fact that russias gdp is outranked by brazils to protect what the soviets used to call druzhba narodov the friendship of the nations we could always switch from russophobia to putinphobia but theres an issue there the word phobia contains the implication that the fear is irrational in the case of russia thats probably true in the case of putin himself the fear seems rational its just hard to work out if theres more to fear if he knows exactly what hes doing or if chernobylstyle he really doesnt

however none of the fears generated by his early statements on russia have become a reality if you strip away his ostensibly chummy personal relationship with putin trumps russia policy has been drastically more assertive than that of his predecessor in months here is what his administration has done authorized lethal military aid to ukraine while former president barack obamas administration continuously rejected lethal weapons exports after russias invasion of ukraine in trump is said to have personally approved the policy whether he told his staff to downplay the decision is immaterial in fact trump has gone even further selling javelin antitank missiles to ukraine these moves could fundamentally change the balance of power on the ground to be sure moscow retains substantial military advantages but usmade javelins in ukrainian hands will reduce the kremlins incentive for largescale hostilities shuttered two russian consulates multiple diplomatic annexes and expelled diplomats while obama did shut down russian government installations in maryland and new york trumps closure of consulates in seattle and san francisco and the expulsion of dozens of diplomats are unprecedented and important punitive measures sanctioned russian oligarchs and officials this month trump sanctioned nearly oligarchs the businesses they own or control and numerous russian officials significantly the administration justified its latest sanctions in uniquely broad terms suggesting that future sanctions need not be tied to specific russian actions expanded the magnitsky sanctions list trump could have easily refused to expand the magnitsky sanctions a list of corrupt russian officials and human rights violators instead he added names including chechen dictator and close putin associate ramzan kadyrov and the son of russian prosecutor general yury chaika forced the usbased subsidiaries of russian statebacked propaganda outlets rt and sputnik to register as foreign agents despite kremlin complaints the justice department ordered rt america ria global reston translator and tr productions to register under the foreign agents registration act all are now required to disclose their finances and activities in the united states targeted russia with sanctions over north korea iran and ukraine the white house sanctioned additional russian companies and individuals in connection with moscows continued occupation of crimea and eastern ukraine those targeted included heavy hitters such as russian deputy energy minister andrey cherezov the administration has also gone after entities known to aid the north korean and iranian ballistic missile and nuclear programs more than tripled defense initiatives to deter russian aggression in europe trumps budget request for the european reassurance initiative totaled nearly billion thats billion more than the obama administration allocated for the fiscal year formally blamed russia for the notpetya cyberattack last year the virus intended to disrupt the ukrainian financial system quickly spread to computers around the world including denmark india and the united states the trump administration was unambiguous in its determination that the attack was part of the kremlins ongoing effort to destabilize ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly russias involvement in the ongoing conflict killed or injured hundreds of russian mercenaries and dozens of russian troops in syria under the obama administration the united states was primarily interested in deconflicting with russian operations in syria lest an incident occur now us military posture is less preoccupied with russian actions instead its attitude is that putin should be the one on the defensive the us militarys looser rules of engagement and direct response to russian forces in syria have conveyed just that more than a year into his presidency trumps russia policy is far more forceful than that of his predecessor it is substantive antagonistic to russian aims and not at all to the kremlins liking still this fact has been buried by politics optics and the presidents own behavior some in the russian government however continue to cling to the idea that trump is on their side russian foreign minister sergei lavrov recently voiced his own theory of the relationship he explained in an interview with russian newspaper kommersant that trump knows perfectly that the congress would make him take action if the us president refuses to do what the overwhelming majority of congressmen want and there is such a majority i say once again his veto will be overcome lavrov is right that congress supported and adopted many of the new russia sanctions and it deserves credit for those moves this does not however negate the presidents own policy choices trump was not required to provide lethal military aid to ukraine he did not have to expand the magnitsky list and could have made use of national security waivers to avoid adding new names his justice department did not have to force rt to register as a foreign agent or cease its operations in the united states he could have easily stayed quiet on moscows poisoning of exspy sergei skripal in britain rather than crack down on russias diplomatic presence in the united states after all this if lavrov still believes that trump is eager to pursue some kind of detente with russia his denial borders on delusion trumps russia policy is his own either lavrov is playing to a domestic audience and refusing to admit the kremlins mistaken faith in trump or getting played trumps policy toward the kremlin should be evaluated on its merits if you extract partisan politics and strip away justifiable distaste for his general conduct what remains is arguably the most effective russia policy since the end of the cold war

http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43741140,198,23,but maria zakharova from the russian foreign ministry said the allegations in relation to the poisoning of sergei and yulia skripal were a clear antirussian campaign the like of which we have not seen in the world for a long time in terms of its scale and lack of principles

https://www.voanews.com/a/theresa-may-responds-to-russian-spy-poisoning/4296219.html,200,170,the clock is ticking towards the britishset deadline of midnight tuesday for the kremlin to explain why a russian developed militarygrade nerve agent was used to poison a former russian double agent and his daughter in a small cathedral town in south england no one in the british government is holding their breath for a russian response or an adequate one from londons point of view and as the deadline looms british officials are scrambling to garner the support of western allies and they appear ready if necessary to invoke natos article on collective defense which has only been invoked once before in the western alliances year history in her statement before a somber house of commons monday saying it was highly likely the kremlin had authorized the march poisoning of sergei skripal a former russian military intelligence officer recruited by britains foreign intelligence service mi and his yearold daughter british prime minister theresa may chose her words carefully she angled her words say her aides so as to be able to widen the international dimension of the unfolding political and diplomatic crisis thats plunging anglorussian relations to their lowest point since the cold war should there be no credible response we will conclude that this action amounts to an unlawful use of force by the russian state against the united kingdom may said in a key legal paragraph in her statement the law under international law a state thats been the victim of the unlawful use of force by another is allowed to respond by carefully choosing her phrase may indicated she is treating the attempted assassination of the skripals not as a criminal act but as a statesponsored attack on britain as a whole that also prepares the ground for britain to follow americas example in the wake of the september terror attacks on new york and washington dc and invoke article of the nato treaty which states the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and that they should work together to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area the language may used contrasts with the british reaction to the fatal poisoning of another former russian spy the dissident alexander litvinenko who died after drinking tea laced with polonium then there was no talk of an unlawful use of force by russia may has won words of general support from international allies but none mentioned natos article us secretary of state rex tillerson said whoever had ordered the attack must face serious consequences in a statement he said we have full confidence in the uks investigation and its assessment that russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack that took place in salisbury last week there is never a justification for this type of attack the attempted murder of a private citizen on the soil of a sovereign nation and we are outraged that russia appears to have again engaged in such behavior we agree that those responsible both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it must face appropriately serious consequences natos secretary general jens stoltenberg said the use of any nerve agent is horrendous and completely unacceptable the uk is a highly valued ally and this incident is of great concern to nato after speaking with may on the phone french president emmanuel macron said paris stood in solidarity with britain skeptics but british officials privately concede anxiety about what practical support they will be able to secure and the reception theyll get when asking for a coordinated western response to russia officials welcomed the condemnation monday of the poisoning of the skripals from white house spokeswoman sarah sanders but were left uneasy when she omitted to name russia specifically as the culprit whatever measures britain takes against russia what will really count is a realization from washington to brussels to berlin that a full scale strategy of the west is needed to show strength and resolve in the face of unacceptable behavior former british foreign secretary william hague wrote in britains daily telegraph tuesday a former director of policy planning at nato fabrice pothier says theres little appetite among europeans for adding more economic and financial sanctions on top of those already imposed and renewed by the european union this week for another six months on russia for the annexation of ukraines crimea relations between britain and its european allies are being roiled also by the testy negotiations over brexit martin mccauley a former london university professor and member of the

https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201803151062574161-uk-skripal-story-investigation-journalist/,212,179,ahmed outlined to sputnik what he sees as the major problems with the british governments story he said that even if we assume the identification of novichok is correct this does not necessarily implicate the russian government because others could have made the same poison independently the existence of the covert ussrrun novichok programme only came to light after a senior soviet scientist vil mirzayanov defected and published a book ahmed explained the problem is that while mirzayanov has been interviewed by the press saying that only the russian state could have pulled of this attack he also said that anyone could theoretically manufacture novichok by following the formulas he has openly published in his book chronicling his defection read more us had access to substance allegedly used to poison skripal since report ahmed also brought up the fact mirzayanov wrote in a paper that novichok was designed so that it could be produced from ordinary organophosphates that can be made at commercial chemical companies and thus the components to create novichoks could be easily hidden in normal activities he went on what this means though is that the lead source of the claims about novichok actually is saying that this militarygrade nerve agent can be manufactured by literally any qualified person using his formulas this is quite extraordinary and completely contradicts theresa mays claim that the russian state alone must be the source of the novichok the opcw it gets murkier it gets murkier according to ahmed because the opcw organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons verified the complete destruction of russias chemical weapons manufacturing capabilities he pointed out that the opcws scientific advisory board included dr robin black who was apparently involved at porton down in the detection of novichok in the skripal poisoning in the board dismissed the threat from alleged secret russian stocks of novichok due to the lack of information about their properties or solid evidence that they even existed read more russia destroyed stocks of nerve agent uk claimed was used to kill exspy mp ahmed elaborated black wrote a scientific review about chemical weapons in in which he also stated that there was no independent confirmation of mirzayanovs claims about novichoks he highlighted the british governments latest move to have the opcw participate in the salisbury poisoning investigation to verify its claims about novichok being used and asked how can the opcw verify something whose very existence and properties they dont have any information on and given that the opcw found no evidence of any novichok programmes in russia how would they be able to confirm or deny that any such novichok evidence from salisbury leads unequivocally to russia and russia alone furthermore as murray has drawn attention to mirzayanov is an uzbek name and if there was a soviet novichok development programme then it was in uzbekistan far away from modern russia murrays blog records how he visited the nukus chemical weapons site and confirms that it was dismantled and the chemical weapons stocks destroyed by the us government a process that finished while murray was ambassador there murray wrote there has in fact never been any evidence that any novichok ever existed in russia itself a transatlantic decision to ramp up pressure on russia when asked about the motives behind the british governments public claims of russian responsibility ahmed pointed to a us army document that discusses the overthrow of vladimir putin and plans to destabilize russia and mold it into what the west wants russia to look like he zeroed in on the contradictions inherent in the situation it seems that for whatever reason there is a transatlantic decision to ramp up pressure on russia imagine if such a document had been found from the russian military saying similar things about the us thered be uproar and rightly so not so curiously when it comes to our own governments as such ahmed explained the decision to immediately blame the poisoning of sergei and yulia skripal is thoroughly politicised and the british state has seized the moment to whip up antirussian hysteria he cited the domestic impact as everybody stops talking about how idiotic the tory government is instead obsessing about putin and criticized the british press for willingly going along with the governments story its pretty revealing that almost no effort to scrutinise the uk governments approach to this has come from the press at all in fact the climate is the opposite anyone who asks questions is essentially a prorussian stooge or a putin lover talking obvious absurdities this is a bizarre mccarthyist climate the other potential culprits

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-we-know-about-novichok-the-newby-nerve-agent-linked-to-russia/,216,182,the following essay is reprinted with permission from the conversation an online publication covering the latest research a sovietdesigned novichok chemical is the nerve agent responsible for poisoning a former spy and his daughter british prime minister theresa may said today sergei and julia skripal were found collapsed on a park bench on sunday march in the english town of salisbury a few hours after eating lunch and spending time at a restaurant and pub nearby as reported by the bbc may said the uk must stand ready to take extensive measures if russia does not provide an adequate explanation for the use of this agent on british soil what are the origins of novichok the novichok group of molecules are nerve agents developed by the soviets from the late s but never produced on a large scale at least to the best of public knowledge they are referred to as third generation nerve agents to indicate their production as a followon to the gseries agents such as sarin also referred to as gb developed in germany prior to wwii and the vseries agents such as vx gas first developed by the uk in the s the name novichok translates colloquially from russian as newbies scientists who worked on the novichok project disclosed details from onwards they stated that the project goals included developing weapons that could not be detected by the then standard nato chemical weapons detection sensors have potential to circumvent the chemical weapons convention would be easier to produce using methods and materials prevalent in pesticides industries were designed from the outset to be binary chemical weapons where two relatively nontoxic materials are mixed together just before dispersal to minimise the danger to the personnel delivering the weapons how would novichok use be confirmed members of the public said that julie skripal appeared passed out on the park bench in salisbury and her father was making strange movements with his hand the two remain in a critical condition in hospital nerve agents like novichok are all organophosphate compounds which act by blocking the normal processes that control nerve activity symptoms are given the mnemonic slugem salivationthe famous foaming at the mouth lacrimationcrying or tears pouring from the eyes urination defecation gastrointestinal distress emesis vomitingas the body loses control over muscles particularly those of the sphincters miosisone of the key diagnostics the muscles that cause the pupil to constrict become fully activated and the pupils become pinpoints in the iris the final m is sometimes given as muscle spasms the type of spasms associated with organophosphate poisoning are somewhat diagnostic although some of these symptoms are common with other nervous system disruptions doctors are taught to look for these symptoms together as a sign of exposure to organophosphates apart from the physical signs and symptoms to confirm identity of the agent police and doctors take blood or other fluid samples or wipe the patients skin with a gauze to pick up any residue of the agent those samples are reasonably stable and could be sent to an analytical chemistry laboratory for identification the uk has an organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw designated laboratory run by the defence science and technology laboratory chemical and biological systems the lab is located at porton down around miles from the scene of the attack in australia the equivalent opcw designated laboratory is operated by the defence science and technology group the handbook of recommended operating procedures for analysis in the verification of chemical disarmament also known as the blue book does not have a specific method for detecting novichok agents however it would be reasonable to assume that they would be detectable by the methods available to a well equipped defence science laboratory how could novichok have been administered nerve agents such as sarin are typically used in the form of a gas or vapour but novichok agents can be made in a solid form most likely a powder this would make them a relatively simple agent to be used on a battlefield as may have been the original design motivation or to add to food or to be left in a home as may be the case with the skripals nerve agents are bioavailable from the gut that is they can absorb into the body after being eaten that route of delivery isnt well studied but is consistent with the slightly slower onset of symptoms in sergei and julia skripal in comparison nerve agents administered via aerosol or spray are effective very quicklykim jongnam died shortly after facial exposure to nerve agent vx in a malaysian airport novichok agents are said to be particularly effective at penetrating the central nervous system that is the brain and spinal column and causing more severe neurological symptoms than is typical for other nerve agents as well as sergei and julia skripal a policeman has become seriously ill as a result of this incidentits not clear whether this was through attending to the sick pair on the bench or visiting sergei skripals house furthermore the uk government has issued a public health advisory notice for people who were in the pub andor the restaurant at which the skripals

skripals could theoretically recover they may not be in a fit state to act as reliable witnesses to their own attempted murders the question of who was responsible will remainalthough british prime minister may has come to the conclusion that either this was a direct action by the russian state against our country or the russian government lost control of its potentially catastrophically

http://www.businessinsider.com/sergei-skripal-attack-putin-wants-everyone-to-know-its-him-2018-3,217,183,experts think russian president vladimir putin was behind an attack on a former double agent named sergei skripal they told business insider that putin most likely chose a russianmade nerve agent to brazenly claim ownership of the attempted murder while officially denying it russia has been linked to similar cases of poisoning and a raft of geopolitical aggression since putin came to power there is little the uk can do to directly hit back at russia for the attack something that may have motivated the kremlin to push the envelope the uk and the us said monday that a russianmade nerve agent had been used in the english city of salisbury and they blamed russias government or rogue russian agents but the circumstances surrounding the attack have formed a consensus among experts russian president vladimir putin used the attack to send a deliberate message the attack targeted sergei skripal a double agent who passed russian state secrets to british intelligence in the s and early s he was pardoned and sent to the uk as part of a spy swap in skripal and his daughter were hospitalized by the attack and hundreds of residents of the town were warned to wash their clothes to remove risk of exposure to the deadly chemical british scientists identified the chemical as novichok a family of fourthgeneration nerve agents developed since the late s according to the weapons of mass casualties and terrorism response handbook until skripals poisoning many thought novichok was a cold war fiction but now experts suggest it functions as a calling card for putin joshua h pollack the editor of the nonproliferation review tweeted that novichok was a signature chemical weapon that the kremlin most likely meant as a declaration of indifference to the suspicions of others something that amounted to putin saying we dont care what you think after the successful identification of vx by the malaysian authorities anyone using a battlefield nerve agent for a highprofile assassination has to know it will be detected pollack continued mentioning the nerve agent used in the killing of kim jong nam north korean leader kim jong uns half brother using such an agent just down the road from porton down one of the worlds centers of expertise on cw or chemical weapons only amplifies the message pollack concluded another expert questioned why attackers would use a distinctly russian chemical agent if they did not want it to look as if russia was to blame the stunning thing about this attack is why novichock when there are other alternatives less provocative and more deniable for russia vipin narang an associate professor of political science at mit with expertise in weapons of mass destruction tweeted but i suppose thats precisely the point wants everyone to know its him what is the uk going to do about it leon neal getty russia denies involvement in the attack even though it has been linked to similar cases of poisoning in the uk alone but by officially denying culpability despite a clear link to russia putin presents the uk with a difficult choice nato experts told business insider that war seemed unlikely as a result of skripals poisoning as wasnt as provocative as russias illegal annexation of crimea and support for separatist rebels in ukraine the uk can expel russian diplomats on its soil and impose sanctions but if the experts are correct that russias government carried out the attack so brazenly then the uks real problem is in moscow not an embassy in london

https://www.vox.com/2018/3/15/17124348/trump-russia-sanctions-uk-treasury-mnuchin,223,187,donald trump is one of the most russiafriendly presidents in modern history but in less than an hour on thursday he rebuked russia harder than he has throughout his entire time in the white house around am the white house released a joint statement in which the us uk france and germany blamed moscow for a nerve agent attack against a russian exspy on british soil it was the first time since the march attack that the trump administration said the kremlin was likely the culprit and at am the us treasury department announced longawaited sanctions to punish russia for its meddling in the presidential election and a worldwide cyberattack last year the measures targeted nearly russian individuals and organizations including members of internet research agency ira the troll farm that used social media to sow divisions before the november vote treasury also sanctioned yevgeny prigozhin known as putins chef for his role in bankrolling russian hackers special counsel robert mueller had indicted ira members and prigozhin last month as part of his ongoing investigation into possible trumprussia collusion during the presidential election put together a president marred by russiarelated scandals and his affinity for vladimir putin has finally pushed back on moscow these targeted sanctions are a part of a broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from russia treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in a statement after the sanctions announcement but even so experts say this response could be too weak to have much of an effect its a good move by the administration to impose sanctions and show solidarity after the kremlins attack in the uk alina polyakova a russia expert at the brookings institution think tank told me but its still not enough to respond to growing russian aggression the joint statement and the sanctions explained on march sergei and yulia skripal were found on an outside bench in salisbury england it turned out they had been poisoned with a highly toxic nerve agent eight days later uk prime minister theresa may said it was highly likely that russia was behind the attack on the skripals when asked about the event later that day white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders declined to directly blame russia but said that we offer the fullest condemnation of the attack but on thursday the white house issued a joint statement with allies to support britains claim which said the united kingdom thoroughly briefed its allies that it was highly likely that russia was responsible for the attack we share the united kingdoms assessment that there is no plausible alternative explanation moscow however denies it had any hand in the attack the sanctions that the us treasury department issued on thursday have a bit more of a backstory it all goes back to the january us intelligence community assessment that russia did meddle in the election and did so to help trump win the white house but then last august trump reluctantly signed into law the countering americas adversaries through sanctions act republican and democratic lawmakers crafted the bill in response to trumps unusual warmth toward russian president vladimir putin and his refusal to blame russia for interfering in the election the legislation passed both chambers almost unanimously in the senate and in the house and it was clear that congress would override a presidential veto it was explicitly designed to make old sanctions against russia permanent and pressure trump to impose new ones the bill forced trump to impose costs on putin for interfering in americas democratic process and for his interventions in ukraine and syria but trump resented congresss move to box him in on russia policy the president slammed the legislation in a signing statement calling it seriously flawed and said that he could make far better deals with foreign countries than congress still the law forced trump to impose sanctions in late january but he missed the deadline instead the administration released a list of russian leaders and billionaires with purported ties to putin in order to indicate that the administration was watching them then on march mnuchin and director of national intelligence dan coats announced that new sanctions on russia were imminent with mnuchin adding that trump was fully supportive of the work were doing and on thursday the sanctions were finally announced senior administration officials told reporters that the sanctions were meant to punish russia for interfering in the election and for masterminding a global cyberattack known as notpetya that hit large corporations and hospitals in the us and europe last summer the administration is arguably for the first time directly acknowledging and responding to russias intervention in the campaign sean kane a former sanctions official at the treasury department told me the new measures target five russian organizations and russian individuals the big organizational targets include two russian intelligence agencies known by their acronyms fsb and gru and prominent russians like prigozhin that means people connected to the intelligence agencies and prigozhin himself cannot travel to america or do business with american companies and will soon see their us assets frozen experts tell me the timing of the sanctions was surely meant to show support for london and condemn moscow after the nerve agent attack now the question is does this signal a change in trumps attitude toward russia well its complicated is trump tough on russia now despite the sanctions trump continues to minimize russias involvement in the election he thinks russia didnt interfere and that democrats use the trumprussia narrative as an excuse for losing the election hes famously called the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with russia a witch hunt and on february mueller filed charges against russian nationals and three russian groups who allegedly interfered with the us elections including members of the ira and prigozhin even trumps own national security team said he could be tougher on russia on february coats told the senate intelligence committee that russia would continue to interfere in american elections frankly the united states is under attack two weeks later on february adm michael rogers who leads us cyber command said during a congressional hearing that trump had yet to ask him to take measures against russias hackers if we dont change the dynamic here this is going to continue and wont be viewed as something isolated rogers told the senate armed services committee this is something that will be sustained over time other military leaders echoed the admirals sentiment including army lt gen paul nakasone trumps nominee to replace rogers i would say right now they do not think much will happen to them he said of russia during his confirmation hearing last week they dont fear us that in part is why experts seem skeptical that trump will all of a sudden become a russia hawk trump has a reluctance divorced from what is best for america to speak clearly about the threat russia poses to the united states and our allies evelyn farkas formerly the pentagons top russia official told me and lawmakers many of whom are usually critical of the president feel he could do more to punish russia if president trump believes that todays action sufficiently addresses the sanctions package congress sent to respond forcefully to moscows election interference then he is sorely mistaken california rep adam schiff the top democrat on the house intelligence committee said in a statement trump likes to boast over and over again that hes much tougher on russia than his predecessor barack obama today is the first time he really did anything to back up that claim and he may have more chances by no means will this constitute the end to our ongoing campaign to instruct mr putin to change his behavior a senior administration official told reporters on thursday morning

a russian inventor in pretrial custody valery pshenichny was jailed in january after being accused of embezzling m rubles m in a defence contract to develop d submarine models just three weeks later his body was found hanging from an improvised lace noose in his st petersburg prison cell prison authorities initially insisted it was suicide but friends of the businessman sensed something was up

official investigations to return with anything other than a whitewash in this case they seem to have worked without interference from prison officers the activist zoya svetova told the independent

https://www.yahoo.com/news/russians-says-chemist-uncovered-existence-novichok-075342077.html,229,48,princeton united states afp the russian chemist who first revealed the existence of novichok nerve agents says only the russians can be behind the weapons use in britain against a former spy and his daughter vil mirzayanov came to the united states in after years of working for the state scientific research institute of organic chemistry and technology or gniiokht it was he who in the early s revealed the existence of that class of ultrapowerful nerve agents he did so first in the russian media as it opened up with the collapse of the soviet union and later with chemical formulas at hand in his book state secrets published in former russian agent sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were found slumped on a bench in the english city of salisbury on march britain says it is highly likely that moscow was to blame for the nerve agent attack mirzayanov speaking at his home in princeton new jersey said he is convinced russia carried it out as a way of intimidating opponents of president vladimir putin only the russians developed this class of nerve agents said the chemist they kept it and are still keeping it in secrecy the only other possibility he said would be that someone used the formulas in his book to make such a weapon dangerous for the kremlin he said that the russians could argue that maybe someone had synthesized them and they could make me guilty this is the first time the nerve agents which took years to develop and were tested on animals have been used to try to kill somebody mirzayanov said why now mirzayanov said he believes the kremlin wants to intimidate people such as enemies of putin for instance he hypothesized suppose someone leaves russia with material that would compromise president donald trump in the us probe into whether his election campaign colluded with russia in its alleged drive to help him beat hillary clinton story continues its very dangerous for the kremlin because it is a plot against america said the chemist so they threaten this person and they say look what happened to skripal the same could happen to you mirzayanov said skripal could no longer cause russia any problems but the kremlin could have killed him anyway and in a cruel fashion just to intimidate potential opponents no cure an attack with novichok agents which are times stronger than vx is excruciating and has no cure he added he said half a gram is enough to kill a person who weighs kilos pounds someone exposed to it first has their vision go blurry and if no antidote is applied are then hit with violent convulsions and can no longer breathe i have seen the effect on animals rabbits dogs it is awful he said even if they do not die skripal and his daughter will suffer for the rest of their lives he predicted the nerve agents are easy to administer because they are binary meaning they result from the mix of two substances which on their own are harmless so these two parts can be transported with no risk then blended to make the weapon in a spray gun mirzayanov said that as awful as it has been the attack in britain might lead to something good the uk and other western countries insisting on novichok agents being registered in the convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons as he has been urging for more than years had these weapons been placed under control the salisbury attack might not have happened he said now that mirzayanov is speaking openly about novichok his friends on facebook and elsewhere are urging him to be careful lest the russians seek reprisal against him but i have lived for quite a long time they cannot stop me i will work until the end to have novichok placed under international control he said

sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were poisoned in salisbury england by a novichok nerve agent the british government investigated and concluded that it was highly likely that russia was responsible for the attack wp get the full experience choose your plan arrowright the european union also issued a strong statement and expressed unqualified solidarity with the united kingdom in the face of this grave challenge to our shared security austria signed on to the eu statement but then held back when the united kingdom united states and a number of eu countries subsequently expelled some russian diplomats viennas decision not to follow suit drew heavy criticism from other eu members why did austria backpedal many former diplomats and politicians in austria and the international media were quick to point a finger at the countrys farright freedom party fpö which has been in a ruling coalition with the conservative austrian peoples party since december advertisement its true the farright freedom party has close ties with russia the party signed a cooperation agreement with vladimir putins united russia party in december in november several fpö members also visited crimea in apparent support for russias annexation of the peninsula but there are other explanations why austria decided not to expel any russian diplomats reasons that reflect the countrys cold war history austrias history of neutrality austria joined the european union in but is not a member of nato because of its postworld war ii neutrality stance this neutrality policy dates to when western allies and the soviet union ended their year occupation of austria on the condition that it would become a neutral country and not join any military alliance advertisement the notion of neutrality is deeply rooted in the austrian national selfperception and makes up a large part of the austrian identity austrians like to evoke the difficult negotiations of the austrian state treaty in moscow in april and the myth that they were successful because of austrian foreign minister leopold figls ability to tolerate as much vodka as nikita khrushchev who was then first secretary of the communist party of the soviet union the signing of the state treaty in vienna on may between the austrian government and the allied forces marked a major milestone in austrian history and signified the countrys independence and sovereignty the constitutional law on the neutrality of austria adopted by the austrian parliament in october stipulates that austria shall never accede to any military alliance or allow the establishment of military bases on its territory it is important to note that neutrality was a precondition for austrian sovereignty austria as a bridgebuilder between east and west in the s austrian chancellor bruno kreisky took neutrality one step further and established the countrys active neutrality policy under its social democrat leadership austria took on a more active diplomatic role in particular to foster dialogue between east and west there was a precedent us president john f kennedy and soviet premier nikita khrushchev held highlevel talks in vienna in advertisement the policy also included austrian participation in un peacekeeping operations and establishing vienna as a hub for un agencies and other international organizations including the organization for security and cooperation in europe will austria now take on mediator role in the skripal case this history is the leadup to austrian chancellor sebastian kurzs announcement that austria was willing to mediate in the skripal case kurz europes youngest leader at age had repeatedly offered to host highlevel talks between putin and trump even before the skripal crisis erupted kurzs centerright conservative peoples party won a snap election in october last year we will not take any national measures kurz and austrian foreign minister karin kneissl said in a joint statement on march a statement that helps explain why austria did not join with other european countries in expelling russian diplomats in protest indeed we want to keep the channels of communication to russia open austria is a neutral country and sees itself as a bridgebuilder between east and west they said advertisement in recent weeks kneissl repeated the offer to mediate in the skripal case as well as in the syrian conflict kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov suggested in late march that moscow in principle welcomed offers of mediation an opportunity to discuss this issue further could arise when kneissl travels to moscow to meet russian foreign minister sergey lavrov on friday the political science behind austrias move while there is suspicion among some eu countries that austria could be developing ties to russia that are a tad too close the austrian focus on dialogue also reflects viennas concerns about the escalation of tensions between russia and the west and strained relations not seen since the cold war in a worsening security situation there is a tendency on both sides to focus on projecting military strength for example both nato and russia are conducting more military exercises and military maneuvers to deter the other side advertisement hence in the current international context different actors assume different roles and austria appears to be stepping into its dialogue and diplomacy stance its a role that got the attention of both russia and ukraine recently regarding the idea of austrian peacekeepers among others for a potential un peacekeeping mission that is under negotiation for eastern ukraine this move along with austrias restraint following the skripal poisoning fits squarely in line with austrian efforts at neutrality and mediation in cold war conflicts going back at least half a

russian diplomats in a coordinated response to the poisoning of former russian spy sergei skripal prompting russia to vow retaliation on monday the united states european union countries canada and ukraine expelled russian diplomats in a coordinated response to the poisoning of former russian spy sergei skripal prompting russia to vow retaliation mondays move is apparently the largestever expulsion of foreign diplomats from the united states the country also closed russias consulate in seattle allegedly because of its proximity to a us submarine base the move comes just weeks after the poisoning on british soil of skripal who spied for the united kingdom and his daughter a police officer also was sickened in the attack which involved a deadly nerve agent the united states calls on russia to accept responsibility for its actions and to demonstrate to the world that it is capable of living up to its international commitments and responsibilities as a member of the un security council to uphold international peace and security state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement monday most of the eu countries kicked out but a handful of diplomats france germany and poland will each expel four lithuania and the czech republic are kicking out three each and italy denmark and the netherlands are all sending away two canada joined in too kicking out four and ukraine is set to expel the united states expelled including members of the russian embassy and alleged intelligence operatives from the russian mission to the united nations which russians have reportedly been using as a spy nest for years here in new york russia uses the united nations as a safe haven for dangerous activities within our own borders nikki haley the us ambassador to the united nations said in a statement monday today the united states and many of our friends are sending a clear message that we will not stand for russias misconduct mark simakovsky a nonresident senior fellow at the atlantic council says that on top of last years closure of the russian consulate in san francisco the latest move has restricted russias presence in the united states which will have commercial intelligence and diplomatic ramifications for russia the administration didnt have to go this far he says it should be seen as significant but the coordinated move signifies that the united states canada ukraine and the european union stand together against russias alleged attempts to destabilize their countries but the joint effort also guarantees retaliation escalates the situation and comes at a time that is likely to offend not just the kremlin but the russian people moscow already vowed to expel no less than us diplomats simakovsky predicts that twothirds will be from moscow while the rest will be taken from consulates around the country he also says he wouldnt be surprised if they chose to close maybe the consulate in vladivostok a city in russias far east a sort of coastal diplomatic tit for tat indeed the russian embassy in washington is currently polling twitter as to which us consulate should be closed vladivostok is the first choice listed that means both sides russia and the west will have fewer diplomats working to lower tensions i think the challenge here is were in this world of signaling without talking to each other says olga oliker a senior advisor and director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies another concern along with retaliation is that the expulsions may do little to change russian behavior the us has expelled russian diplomats before and it hasnt deterred the kremlin from continuing its destabilizing activities abroad rachel rizzo a research associate for the transatlantic security program at the center for a new american security wrote to foreign policy in an email its unlikely this time will be different the move is also unlikely to dispel the kremlin myth that the western world is out to get russia after all in this case european and north american countries quite literally did coordinate against russia there is no doubt that the kremlin will use the expulsion of diplomats to continue exploiting its besieged fortress image which based on the results of the last elections sells well says maria snegovaya an adjunct fellow at the center for european policy analysis that is particularly true given the timing of the expulsions on sunday a fire at a shopping center in the siberian city of kemerovo left at least people many of them children dead samuel greene the director of the russia institute at kings college london suspects that perhaps there were too many countries involved to call off or delay the diplomatic expulsions a day after one of the deadliest fires in modern russian history that strikes me as a rather poor excuse though he says

https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-interview-us-ambassador-says-russia-must-change-behavior/4322596.html,251,209,you can never stage or time things perfectly laughs jon huntsman the us ambassador to russia he is discussing the controversial phone call president donald trump made last week to vladimir putin in which he congratulated the russian leader on his reelection the call surprised white house advisers whod urged trump to withhold compliments it also raised expectations falsely in moscow the united states might not join a coordinated campaign by two dozen western countries to retaliate for the poisoning of a former russian spy in britain that london has blamed on the kremlin in an exclusive interview with voa appraising where the relationship stands between the us and russia huntsman says trump has remained consistent in his strategy towards russia i can tell you that as long as i have discussed russia with the president which goes back to when he sat me down and asked me to take this job he has been very consistent about wanting to engage notwithstanding our challenges his desire to engage and keep a dialogue alive and well but he stresses trump has made it clear he expects any kind of engagement and meetings at the head of state level to be based on progress on the issues that matter most coming from the private sector and i have worked for many presidents republican and democrat he is a resultsoriented person he wants to know where we are going whats been done what kind of progress for example on ukraine and issues like that he is very much into the results and where the relationship is heading for an ambassador whos in the eye of a cold warstyle storm huntsman remains determinedly upbeat he is braced for the kremlin response to the us decision to expel dozens of russian diplomats i expect they will respond whether it will be an asymmetrical response or a symmetrical response we will have to wait to see he said hours later russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia will expel an equal number of us diplomats continue engagement huntsman said however the kremlin reacts it is the responsibility of both countries to stay engaged no matter how difficult these bilateral issues or regional issues become watch us ambassador to russia jon hunstman on the usrussia relationship and to remain engaged in wake of a russian presidential election huntsman says bore no relationship to a real poll i am not sure you can call it an election he says i have run for office a few times and i recognize an election when i see it when you have got robust debate you have a fullyengaged media that are talking about the issues that matter the most i did not hear a lot of dialogue about the issues that are front and center he adds huntsman says the confrontation with russia wont end even if the kremlin restricts its retaliation to a proportional titfortat the issues dividing the west and russia isnt only about the poisoning of former russian spy sergei skripal and his yearold daughter yulia it depends on how you define the endpoint he says but clearly a successful outcome would be that russia steps back from its malign activity and becomes a responsible partner he cites syria as an example complaining that russia voted five time on the un security council against investigating chemical weapons abuses by syria trust in britain in his interviews with russian media he is asked often why the united states believes britain that the russian state was behind the march skripal assassination attempt to voa he says you dont just decide to believe we are a grownup mature democracies we have robust civil society we are open transparent countries both the united states and the uk so it is not like you can conduct an investigation without a lot of very interested and probing eyes following the case the entire way so that is the environment we are operating in the burden is on the uk to look at the case to investigate and to come up with their results and of course there has been some close sharing of information that is the way these things go with the security services he says people will learn a lot more as we go forward i suspect but even in the middle of diplomatic standoff that most veterans liken to some of the lowest points of the cold war huntsman says the united states must stay engaged as best it can pushing for change and improvements the relationship is stressed he says for those who say theres nothing left nonsense he adds he says it would be highly irresponsible not to continue engagement with russia on issues like strategic stability and arms control peace and stability in the middle east and syria which he says must be brought to an end both from a conflict standpoint and a creation of a government thereafter but he acknowledges a sudden breakthrough is unrealistic hopes are dashed relationships crumble we have seen that over and again the focus has to be on where our interests overlap and can come together and begin to forge a dialogue

states britain and france launched a joint attack on syrian military targets during the early hours of the morning in response to a suspected poison gas attack that killed dozens of people in douma

programme had been set back three years we cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised either within syria on the streets of the uk or elsewhere mrs may told reporters when asked if the strikes could be seen as a warning to russia the prime minister said the military action should send a message that chemical weapons could not be used with impunity the action that took place last night was an action which was focused on degrading and deterring the operational capability and the willingness of the syrian regime to continue to use chemical weapons she added there have been many instances when we have seen them using those chemical weapons but i believe it should also be a message to others that the international community is not going to stand by and allow chemical weapons to be used with impunity the uk has accused russia of carrying out an attempted assassination of former double agent mr skripal a claim moscow vehemently denies an independent investigation by the

agency and bad policy decisions have played in bringing the united states and russia to the current impasse distracts us from more important challenges and discourages us from thinking creatively about how to move beyond the present level of rancor to see why this is so remember what the original cold war was like for starters the cold war was a bipolar competition in which the united states and the soviet union were far and away the two most powerful countries in the world although other factors contributed to their rivalry see below each was the others greatest potential threat and by necessity each kept a wary eye on the other to a large extent the cold war was structurally determined by the global distribution of power among states and some sort of rivalry was probably inevitable even if other factors were involved and helped determine its intensity moreover the two superpowers stood in rough parity with each other although the united states was on balance in a much better position the united states economy was about twice as large as the soviet unions and its allies were far more capable and reliable than theirs after all the united states had west germany the united kingdom japan france israel and a number of other powerful states on its side the ussr had the likes of south yemen cuba angola and a bunch of restive satellites in the warsaw pact china was moscows junior partner at first but the two communist giants soon had a nasty falling out and beijing tacitly realigned with the united states in the s as did egypt another soviet client state the united states had vastly greater powerprojection capabilities a superior navy and air force more sophisticated technology and better training but the soviet union did have a large and wellequipped army that was designed for offensive warfare and its forces lay close to western europe and not that far from the persian gulf and it eventually acquired a large arsenal of nuclear weapons on balance the united states was ahead but never by a big enough margin to relax so the two superpowers competed constantly for additional influence and did whatever they could to weaken the other without provoking world war iii at the same time the cold war also featured an intense competition between rival political ideologies liberal capitalism and marxismleninism both were inherently universalist ideologies insofar as their proponents believed that each provided a model for organizing society that was broadly applicable everywhere in the world liberal capitalism rested on claims about basic rights that all humans were said to possess while marxismleninism rested on scientific laws of social and economic development that marx and his followers had supposedly discovered because each ideology saw itself as universally valid proponents felt obliged to try to spread them far and wide even worse given each sides universalist pretensions the mere existence of one posed a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of the other for both ideological and powerpolitical reasons therefore live and let live was never a serious option finally as my colleague arne westad has shown clearly the cold war was a global competition waged on every continent in the world the rivalry between moscow and washington shaped much of the agenda of world politics from the s onward and had farreaching and frequently negative effects in europe the middle east africa asia and latin america that was the real cold war ladies and gentlemen and lets not forget that it was punctuated by several intense nuclear crises an arms race in which each side accumulated tens of thousands of powerful hydrogen bombs and proxy wars in which millions died while regrettable and maybe even dangerous what is happening today is a very different animal first and most obviously the world today is not bipolar it is either still unipolar or some sort of heavily lopsided multipolar system with the united states still no and the other major powers trailing behind if bipolarity eventually returns as many believe it will china not russia will be the other pole and in a striking reversal of the early cold war russia is now chinas junior partner and will be far weaker than its asian neighbor for decades to come russia will likely fall well behind india too but thats another story second there was a certain rough parity during the cold war but today the united states is vastly stronger on nearly every dimension that matters the us economy is about trillion while russias is less than trillion america is technologically sophisticated and highly innovative while russias wealth such as it is relies mostly on energy exports whose value is likely to decline as mankind gradually weans itself off fossil fuels in the meantime hardly anybody is saving up pennies or rubles to buy the latest russian smartphone the us population is comparatively young and still rising russias population is aging rapidly and projected to decline sharply in the decades to come compared to the cold war todays united states vs russia matchup is godzilla vs bambi third there is no serious ideological rivalry at play today americas liberal brand may have been tarnished of late but russias ideological appeal outside its borders is minimal marxismleninism captured the imaginations and loyalties of millions of adherents around the world but putinism has appeal only to a handful of oligarchs or wouldbe autocrats donald trump is probably the only person in america who truly believes strongman rule is preferable to democracy but he wont be presidentforlife no matter how much he might want to be fourth the real cold war was a global competition whereas the geopolitical issues that divide the united states and russia today are confined to areas close to russias borders like ukraine or to a small part of the middle east and for all the hot air that has been spouted about putins revisionism russias role in most of these conflicts is essentially negative and defensive and very much the spoiler moscow may be able to keep ukraine from moving toward the west or joining nato and it may be able to keep bashar alassad in power in what remains of syria but like george w bush putin is discovering that clients are hard to control and getting into quagmires is easier than finding ones way out moscow has shown little capacity to achieve positive ends on the world stage or to bring other nations together to work toward the goal of mutual betterment when compared to soviet leaders lofty dreams of world revolution putins global agenda is watereddown vodka but wait what about those dastardly russian attempts to manipulate the us election and to sow discord and disunity via bots internet trolls phony facebook accounts hacked emails and other misdeeds we still dont know the full extent of russian interference in our democracy but americans have every reason to be angry about it and should be demanding that the trump administration take active measures to limit and or deter such behavior in the future at the same time our moral outrage ought to be tempered just a bit by the recognition that washington has repeatedly interfered in other countries politics and used both overt and covert means to dispatch of governments we didnt like as far as we know no americans died as a result of russias meddling but there are hundreds of thousands of iraqis who lost their lives because of our wellintentioned efforts to liberate them equally important russias various activities were possible only because americans had already allowed our democratic institutions to be seriously corrupted long before moscow got involved im not happy about whatever putin fancy bear and other russian agents may have done but newt gingrich fox news breitbart and the drudge report have done far more to fill american heads with claptrap than moscows minions ever did furthermore we shouldnt be at all surprised that someone like putin deeply resentful of repeated us encroachments on russian vital interests saw this opportunity and seized it even a casual knowledge of american history would tell you that it only takes a little bit of foreign interference to get us to freak out completely remember mccarthyism the palmer raids or the one percent doctrine no wonder putin saw us as a fat target but my point is that we mostly did this to ourselves lastly thinking of the current conflict between the united states and russia as a new cold war exaggerates its significance and distracts us from the far more serious challenge we face from a rising china even worse it encourages us to take steps that are actively harmful to our own interests instead of trying to drive a wedge between moscow and beijing as realpolitik would prescribe the new cold war mindset implies that usrussian rivalry is overdetermined and makes us less likely to look for ways to resolve our differences over time even worse it will encourage us to fall back on the confrontational approaches we employed during the real cold war which will merely drive beijing and moscow closer together none of this is to deny that usrussian relations are in a bad state it is also hard to imagine someone as compromised as donald trump doing much to fix it but instead of embracing the language and imagery of the cold war we would do better to think seriously about the missteps and blunders that have brought the united states and russia to the present impasse and look for creative new ways to unwind them and step one is to discard a lazy label that can only get in the way

officials have hinted at further moves a russian news outlet rbc earlier thursday quoted huntsman as saying that such a move was possible though the us embassy later released a transcript of his interview indicating that he was misquoted according to a foreign ministry readout of huntsmans meeting with ryabkov the us ambassador was rebuked for the reported remark and warned that such a move would have the gravest consequences for global stability in addition to the expulsion of russian diplomats monday the united states closed russias consulate in seattle claiming it to be a hub of russian intelligence activity and citing its proximity to a major us nuclear submarine base on march british prime minister theresa may had ordered the expulsion of russian diplomats after moscow rebuffed an earlier demand to explain how a sovietdesigned and russianproduced nerve agent known as novichok came to be used in britain last week of britains allies including the united states agreed to coordinated expulsions of russian diplomats believed to be intelligence officers from their respective countries the movement grew this week to include countries a tally by the associated press put

have to leave the russian federation will also be mirrored with respect to other countries lavrov said this is the situation as of now russias move in particular against the united states is a minor escalation said alexander gabuev an analyst at the carnegie moscow center and a former foreign policy correspondent for the kommersant newspaper sixty diplomats is tit for tat but shutting down the

former russian double agent sergei skripal and his daughter yulia skripal in the british town of salisbury on march both skripals remain hospitalized british authorities said thursday that yulia skripal was showing signs of recovery while her father remained in serious but stable condition a police officer who came in contact with the substance also was hospitalized but has since recovered speaking before parliament on monday may said that around british citizens came in contact with the substance may also said that russia has offered different arguments concerning the use of the novichok agent advertisement those arguments included denials that novichok ever existed as well as accusing other former soviet satellites of producing it the only thread linking these denials is that moscow had nothing to do with it and that the accusations are little more than a provocation frolov said that moscows strategy probably will focus on shouldering the blow from the current round of expulsions and pivoting its attention to organizing a summit with president trump putin is hoping to use his charm just as he did with bush in frolov said referring to president george w bush putin needs to move quickly from here to there to score but finds himself blocked by theresa may but it may take a considerable amount of charm to overcome this weeks moves it is clear from the list provided to us the state departments nauert said referring to the expelled diplomats that the russian federation is not interested in dialogue on the issues that matter to our two countries

currency and meddling in each others political internal affairs what are some traditional spycraft activities in simple terms spycraft has two parts espionage and covert action both have a variety of tradecraft techniques and tools including recruitment elicitation entrapment supporting oppositional political activities patronage campaigns designing and disseminating propaganda paramilitary engagement and coup plotting the manner with which any intelligence service would implement these actions spans a spectrum that depending on the target and the stakes may not have many limiting parameters were there norms beyond moscow rules perhaps counterintuitively russia and the united states have been more constrained by selfimposed concepts of propriety or norms the us intelligence services fortunately and rightfully have with rare exception worked within the stringent lines of us law assassinations for example have not been part of us spycraft against russia or anyone else for a long time in the early days of the cold war under white house authority assassination operations were planned or unsuccessfully attempted by the cia against a few leaders including cuban president fidel castro congolese head patrice lumumba and dominican republican president rafael trujillo following the church committee in the early s the cia was forbidden from engaging in this type of activity altogether and thats been rigidly adhered to there have been no instances since then where the cia has targeted any hostile intelligence agents us traitors political opponents or dissidents in the post environment the united states carried out targeted drone attacks against terrorists however congress us courts and the executive branch have not categorized these attacks as assassinations they are viewed as part of a war against battlefield terrorists and what about russia by contrast starting during its tsarist roots soviet and russian intelligence have used assassinations as part of its spycraft tool kit many times from targeting leon trotsky to alexander litvinenko to most recently it seems sergei skripal that said to my knowledge it has never been used against cia personnel or us citizens in general with the possible exception of the bizarre case of us and canadian diplomats in cuba not enough is known yet about this case we know from the mitrokhin archive and from the accounts of defectors like oleg kalugin that many of the soviet intelligence agency kgbs most lethal and outrageous initiatives were actually scrapped by the politburo before implementation today with vladimir putin at the helm i am not sure that there are systemic constraints on russian intelligence actions russia seems unconstrained by any norms whether they be moscow rules risk aversion or rule of law and tenets of common decency the list of russias alleged transgressions keeps mounting unrestrained bombings of civilians in syria meddling in elections in eastern and western europe and united states a systemic doping program for olympic athletes and assassination campaigns against domestic dissidents whistleblowers human rights activists independent journalists and defectors from its intelligence services sergei skripal certainly fits the profile the methods too slow cruel deaths by exposure to carefully crafted toxins are alarming to many is this a new era of no rules in spycraft while russias external intelligence agency svr seems to have clearly jumped the trackas well as the north koreans with the assassination of kim jongnami dont think this qualifies as a new norules era of spycraft rather i would venture to say that some informal restraints remain at play how should the united states and its allies respond what i hope can be done is to walk russia back from the brink through a combination of robust responses and subrosa discussions that would compel russia to constrain its actions on the assassination issue fortunately as yet no americans have been targeted and no acts have been carried out on us soil that said we need to continue to stand in strong solidarity with our british allies and publicly castigate the russians for these acts coupled with strong political and economic sanctions frank conversations aimed at reinstating some form of moscow rules between presidents trump and putin and their intelligence heads ought to be pursued if an arrangement cant be reached we need to respond in kind and apply meaningful political and economic sanctions until they cease and desist this interview has been edited and condensed
http://theconversation.com/why-russia-is-wrong-to-claim-that-britain-violated-the-chemical-weapons-convention-after-skripal-spy-attack-93529,269,225,in her address to the uk parliament on march theresa may confirmed the british governments initial assessment that responsibility for the deployment of a chemical warfare agent in salisbury earlier that month rests with russia the prime minister went on to accuse russia of acting in breach of international law the salisbury incident may said in which former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter were attacked with a nerve agent represented an unlawful use of force against the uk the prime minister charged russia with violating one of the cardinal principles of the international order the prohibition of the use of force in international relations enshrined in article of the united nations charter she also accused russia of flouting its obligations under the chemical weapons convention by running an undeclared chemical weapons programme these statements did not go down well with moscow the russian leadership appeared to be particularly irked by britains demand for an urgent explanation russias foreign minister sergei lavrov condemned this ultimatum itself as a violation of the chemical weapons convention and vowed that russia would ignore it the russian representative to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons denounced the request as absolutely unacceptable and insisted that the uk comply with its own obligations under the chemical weapons convention key to russias handling of the salisbury incident is its attempt to turn the narrative around russia has not only denied responsibility for the attack but it has gone on the diplomatic offensive by seeking to brand the uk as a violator of international law this was particularly evident during the meeting of the un security council on march what the chemical weapons convention says central to the russian approach is the claim that the uk is in breach of article ix of the chemical weapons convention this states states parties should whenever possible first make every effort to clarify and resolve through exchange of information and consultations among themselves any matter which may cause doubt about compliance with this convention or which gives rise to concerns about a related matter which may be considered ambiguous a state party which receives a request from another state party for clarification of any matter which the requesting state party believes causes such a doubt or concern shall provide the requesting state party as soon as possible but in any case not later than ten days after the request with information sufficient to answer the doubt or concern raised along with an explanation of how the information provided resolves the matter russia argues that britains demand for an explanation within less than hours contravenes this provision in particular the more generous time limit of ten days it foresees however the russian position appears to be based on a series of misunderstandings ben birchallpa wire not an exclusive remedy the process set out in article ix cannot be the exclusive remedy in all cases where doubts arise surrounding compliance with the chemical weapons convention for example it would be absurd to suggest that a state which has suffered an armed attack involving chemical weapons may not defend itself against that attack but instead must issue a request for information to the attacking state and then patiently await its response within ten days in fact on a closer reading its clear that the obligation set out in article ix is not of an absolute character it requires state parties to make every effort to clarify and resolve doubts this duty is framed in the language of should rather than shall and is engaged only whenever possible the terms of the clause therefore enable a state to adopt alternative measures should the circumstances so warrant after the salisbury incident one of the uks responses was to call a meeting of the un security council while russia vehemently opposed this move as being contrary to the chemical weapons convention none of the other members of the security council all of which are also signatories of that treaty shared this view it is also important to be clear about the scope of article ix the provision deals with the clarification of doubts surrounding compliance with the chemical weapons convention however the british government had already concluded that it was highly likely that russia was responsible for the incident based on the identification of the nerve agent involved named as novichok the fact that russia has produced the agent in the past and in the light of russias past conduct and current intent it was not unreasonable for the uk government to come to this conclusion in line with the standards of proof applicable in international law in similar circumstances read more salisbury spy attack a lesson from history on how hard it is to prove russian involvement the british government therefore put the following question to moscow was the salisbury incident a direct act by the russian federation amounting to a use of force or did russia lose control over its nerve agent in other words britain requested russia to clarify the nature of its involvement in the incident not to dispel doubts about its compliance with the chemical weapons convention requesting such an urgent clarification is hardly a breach of article ix at any rate it is worth recalling that the provision requires a requested state to respond as soon as possible but in any event not later than ten days after receiving the request accordingly article ix imposes an obligation on russia to respond in good faith without delay rather than confer upon it a right to drag out its answer for up to ten days

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5556715/Boris-Johnson-mocks-Russia-making-loathed-weapon-Novichok-UK-makes-loved-light-sabres.html,278,233,my lord mayor your excellencies ladies and gentlemen im going to talk about britains global role and our work with our allies around the world but i turn first to the events of this remarkable week because never before has there been a collective expulsion of russian diplomats on the scale that we have seen over the last few days as i speak there are now countries that have themselves taken the risk of kicking out people whose presence they deem to be no longer conducive to the public good of course there are many more that have chosen to act in other ways countries that have issued powerful statements or downgraded their representation at the world cup but by your leave my lord mayor and without wishing to be in any way invidious i want to remind you of the full roll of honour albania australia belgium canada croatia czech republic denmark estonia finland france germany hungary ireland italy latvia lithuania macedonia moldova montenegro netherlands norway poland romania spain sweden ukraine united states and nato has either expelled or denied accreditation to russian officials and it seems clear that the kremlin underestimated the strength of global feeling if they thought that the world had become so hardened and cynical as not to care about the use of chemical weapons in a peaceful place like salisbury if they believed that no one would give a fig about the suffering of sergei and yulia skripal or that we would be indifferent to the reckless and contemptuous disregard for public safety that saw others seek medical treatment if they believed that we had become so morally weakened so dependent on hydrocarbons so chronically risk averse and so fearful of russia that we would not dare to respond then this is their answer because these countries know full well that they face the risk of retaliation and frankly there are countries that have taken action that are more vulnerable to russia than we are whether through geography or their energy needs and i pay tribute to them because they know that their own russiabased diplomats and their families must now deal with the possibility of their own lives being turned upside down that is a huge commitment and sacrifice for one country to make let alone and i thank them from the bottom of my heart but of course i know that these thanks are in a sense impertinent because i do not for one moment believe that this global wave of revulsion has been prompted solely by salisbury let alone a sentimental love or affection for the uk though i dont exclude the possibility of such feelings somewhere in the mix it wasnt about us it was about all of us and the kind of world we want to live in because i believe these expulsions represent a moment when a feeling has suddenly crystallised when years of vexation and provocation have worn the collective patience to breaking point and when across the world across continents there are countries who are willing to say enough is enough after the annexation of crimea the intervention in the donbas the downing of mh the cyberattacks the attempted coup in montenegro the concealing of chemical weapon attacks in syria the hacking of the bundestag the interference in elections there are now just too many countries who have felt the disruptive and malign behaviour of the russian state and salisbury has spoken not just to salisbury in south australia and salisbury in pennsylvania in north carolina in maryland but to all the tranquil cathedral cities across europe that could have suffered a similar fate and where people deserve to live free from fear and after all these provocations this week was the moment when the world decided to say enough to the wearying barrage of russian lies the torrent of obfuscation and intercontinental ballistic whoppers first they told us that novichok never existed then they told us that it did exist but they had destroyed the stocks then they claimed that the stocks had escaped to sweden or the czech republic or slovakia or the united states and the other day they claimed that the true inventor of novichok was theresa may in the last few days we have been told that sergei skripal took an overdose that he attempted suicide and therefore presumably tried to take his daughter with him that his attempted murder was revenge for britains supposed poisoning of ivan the terrible or that we did it to spoil the world cup in fact the foreign office has so far counted such ludicrous fibs and so i am glad that countries have stood up to say that they are not swallowing that nonsense any more it is rather like the beginning of crime and punishment in the sense that we are all confident of the culprit and the only question is whether he will confess or be caught and in these last few days it is our values and our belief in the rules based international order that have proved their worth not only has there been a strong and speedy multilateral response from nato and the eu council but countries that are members of neither have come forward to show that this country is blessed to be part of a broader community of ideals and i believe there are many british people who have found it immensely reassuring to learn we may be leaving the eu in exactly a year but we will never be alone and in part that commitment to britain reflects britains reciprocal commitment to our friends whether through the work of our peerless intelligence agencies or our armed forces or our development budgets and that is what i mean by global britain and so i repeat the prime ministers unconditional and immoveable commitment that we will stand by you as you have stood by us we will continue to work with you bringing as we do per cent of eu defence spending per cent of the aid budget per cent of the tonnage of the supply and replenishment vessels needed to keep warships at sea per cent of the heavy lift capacity we are with you in estonia we are with you in training the armed forces in ukraine we are there in nigeria and in the middle east where the fight against daesh goes on and where the uk has delivered the second biggest number of air strikes after the us we are with you in the sahel or we will be with you shortly and hms sutherland is now in the pacific exercising alongside our australian friends and the uk has forces deployed in more countries than any other european power and i have last week announced that we are expanding our fco network with another british diplomats overseas and another ten uk embassies or high commissions in another ten sovereign posts with the commonwealth as a priority especially as we will be hosting its summit next month so that britain will have more diplomatic missions than any other european country exceeding the french by one news that i am told was received with rapture in the quai dorsay since there is no more compelling case for more funding than news of expansion in king charles street we believe in that expansion and we will go further especially in africa because we believe that a global britain is fundamentally in the interests of the british people because it is by being open to the world and engaging with every country that the british people will find the markets for their goods and services and ideas as we have done for centuries in that great free trade revolution that made this city the capital of the world and built the mansion house in which we meet tonight when we leave the eu next year we will reestablish ourselves as an independent member of the wto and we will be the worlds leading proselytiser for free trade and it is symmetrically by being welcoming to talent from abroad as we must and will be that we have brought to our shores for generations people who want to live their lives without fear of judgment or persecution to do as they choose provided they do no harm to others and it is that ethos of generosity that has made this city not just the most diverse in the world but also the most productive region of europe and today the uk is the biggest destination for fdi after the us our unemployment is at the lowest for years i seem to remember some people predicting that it would rise by we have the biggest tech sector the best universities and cambridge university alone has won more nobel prizes than every university in russia and china added together and multiplied by we have the most vibrant and dynamic cultural scene with one venue the british museum attracting more visitors than ten whole european countries that it would not be tactful to name tonight and out of this great minestrone this bouillabaisse this ratatouille this seething and syncretic cauldron of culture we export not just goods though we certainly do but ideas and attitudes and even patterns of behaviour i am delighted to say that in both the czech republic and in iceland they mark jan with silly walks day in honour of monty python there are now nine countries that have their own version of david brent and it is an astonishing fact that both of the two highest grossing movies in the world last year was either shot or produced in this country beauty and the beast and star wars and what is the principal utensil of violence in star wars and where was the light sabre invented in which part of london in uxbridge and south ruislip and that tells you all you need to know about the difference between modern britain and the government of vladimir putin they make novichok we make light sabres one a hideous weapon that is specifically intended for assassination the other an implausible theatrical prop with a mysterious buzz but which of those two weapons is really more effective in the world of today which has done more for our respective economies which has delighted the imaginations of three generations of children and earned billions which one is loved and which one is loathed i tell you that the arsenals of this country and of our friends are not stocked with poison but with something vastly more powerful the power of imagination and creativity and innovation that comes with living in a free society of a kind you see all around you today and it is that power that will prevail and it is in that spirit of absolute confidence and security that it is our job now not just to beware the russian state but to reach out in spite of all our present difficulties to extend the hand of friendship to the russian people because it cannot be said too often that the paranoid imaginings of their rulers have no basis in fact they are not ringed by foes but by countries who see themselves as admirers and friends who have taken this action this week because they want nothing so much as to have an end to this pattern of disruptive behaviour and who want to live in peace and mutual respect and who hope one day that it will be possible to see ever greater commercial and cultural cooperation between us and the russian people and i believe that day can and will come i hope it does and if and when it does i believe it will be thanks to the resolution of all the countries that acted in their different ways this week we will have to keep that resolve because there is no doubt that we will be tested again and i can assure you that in that test the resolve of the british government and people will be unflinching

poisoned by a nerve agent back in march and now russia is paying for the attack sergei skripal and his yearold daughter yulia were found unconscious march on a bench in a shopping mall in salisbury about miles west of london the pair were released from the hospital two months later and moved to a private secure location on aug the us announced it was imposing sanctions on russia for using a chemical weapon in violation of international law though the kremlin repeatedly denied involvement following a day congressional notification period the sanctions took effect on or around aug according to a statement from the state department british prime minister theresa may said days after the poisoning that it was highly likely russia was responsible and the us germany and france all appeared to back her russians charged over novichok poisoning of exspy used fake perfume bottle british officials say since the march attack a british couple with no ties to russia have also been poisoned by the substance in salisbury dawn sturgess died more than a week after authorities believe she was exposed to novichok the militarygrade nerve agent also used in an attempt to assasinate skripal charlie rowley was also exposed to the agent and remains in critical but stable condition on sept authorities in britain charged two russian men identified as alexander petrov and ruslan boshirov with the poisoning of skripal and his daughter as well as sturgess the nerve agent used to poison the skripals was smuggled to britain in a counterfeit nina ricci perfume bottle and applied to the front door of their house according to metropolitan police police believe the couple later found that same bottle thus exposing them to the toxic nerve agent heres what we know about skripal and the incident that nearly killed him his background as a spy skripal served with russias military intelligence often known by its russianlanguage acronym gru and retired in he then worked at the foreign ministry until and later became involved in business skripal was arrested in in moscow and later confessed to having been recruited by british intelligence in he also said at the time that he provided information about gru agents in europe receiving over in return whats the gru russias military intelligence agency things to know at the time of skripals trial the russian media quoted the fsb domestic security agency as saying that the damage from his activities could be compared to harm inflicted by oleg penkovsky a gru colonel who spied for the united states and britain penkovsky was executed in in skripal was convicted on charges of spying for britain and sentenced to years however he later was pardoned and released from custody in july as part of a usrussian spy swap which followed the exposure of a ring of russian sleeper agents in the us skripals wife and son have both died in recent years prior to his wifes death however she reportedly told police she feared for her husbands life the new york daily news reported how world leaders responded to the attack on march world leaders said in a joint statement they abhor the attack against skripal it is an assault on uk sovereignty and any such use by a state party is a clear violation of the chemical weapons convention and a breach of international law it threatens the security of us all the statement signed by british prime minister theresa may president donald trump french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel read the leaders called on russia to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the un security council to uphold international peace and security may had given russia until midnight on march to respond to the charges when moscow failed to respond may expelled russian diplomats from the uk they were given a week to pack their belongings and head back to russia this will be the single biggest expulsion for over years and it will reflect the fact that this is not the first time the russian state has acted against our country may said at the time the us also ordered russian diplomats to leave and announced it would close the russian consulate in seattle in response russia then said it would expel us diplomats and close the us consulate in st petersburg two dozen countries including the us ordered more than russian diplomats out within a oneweek span in a show of solidarity with the uk how russia reacted to the allegations on march russian president vladimir putin said moscow would cooperate with the uk in an investigation of the poisonings calling them a tragedy however putin said if the claims they were poisoned by the sovietdesigned nerve agent were true the victims wouldve died instantly russia does not have such nerve agents putin said according to the guardian we destroyed all our chemical weapons under the supervision of international organizations and we did it first unlike some of our partners who promised to do it but unfortunately did not keep their promises putin added that he thought any sensible person would understand that it would be rubbish drivel nonsense for russia to embark on such an escapade on the eve of a presidential election putins remarks came after russia earlier retaliated against the uk moscow announced march that it also would expel british diplomats among other diplomatic measures fox news travis fedschun

https://sputniknews.com/russia/201804201063740052-putin-trump-wont-allow-conflict-lavrov-interview/,282,236,i find russias composure and selfrestraint of russia sincerely inspiring ive seen a lot including the cold war and i get the impression that if another person was in the kremlin now everything could turn other way round because the provocations seem to follow one another and russia is being provoked and russia always refuses to accept the cold war and the challenge of this kind of sport still you say that its all decreasing but i have another feeling that everything is intensifying the intensity increases and the direct lie is becoming a tool in foreign affairs take for instance boris johnson or our british partners who dont want to listen to or even hear us in my office i have tv screens showing rossiya bbc and cnn rossiya had a story on with the yearold boy who became an involuntary actor in that video telling us what it was like and how he was given dates biscuits and rice it seems like the false flag has been revealed but at the same time the bbc story has the same clip of the alleged chemical attack on like nothing has happened what should happen so that this easing of tensions begins lavrov i didnt say that the campaign is declining i said its losing its momentum you know when a person runs meters or k even better a km hes breathing more and more heavily but he keeps on running and running so his strength leaves him in the end i think we see the same process now although those who want to play out this russophobic campaign also wish for it to gain momentum but you can and you definitely will strain yourself and you are absolutely right im convinced that one should react with dignity we cant but respond when our property is taken or our diplomats expelled otherwise it would mean we had no selfrespect but getting into quarrels rows and brutality is not our presidents style and we are not going to do it hes always looking forward and its very hard if not impossible at all to throw him off balance and they try to do exactly this thing they try to throw somebody off his stride throw him off calmness confidence to ruin our plans that we should bring into life at home and there are plenty of them but i repeat one more time that when we are shouted at a famous wisdom pearl comes to mind jupiter you are angry then you are wrong however one doesnt really see jupiter there but sputnik yes so complimentary however it was recently revealed that trump has invited putin to the white house has there been any update about the time and the place of the meeting or its agenda lavrov we base our assumptions on the fact that during a phone conversation which has already been revealed to the public the us president extended this invitation and said that hed be glad to welcome him in the white house and to meet with him during a return visit and he broached this topic again on several occasions so we let our american colleagues know that we dont want to seem intrusive but we dont want to appear impolite either and considering the fact that president trump made this proposal we assume that hell make it more specific sputnik and then it all was left hanging in in the air lavrov well yes the word got out sputnik so lavrov president putin is ready for such meeting sputnik is this meeting being prepared or not lavrov not yet but if there will be any future developments well definitely tell you ill just point out that after this phone conversation donald trump mentioned several times verbally and via twitter that they need to solve issues with russia that they want to enjoy good relations with russia which is better than not having good relations and that only a fool would think otherwise and we hear all that read more trump still willing to meet putin despite rising usrussia tension white house sputnik but at the same time mike pence said that the us will strive to achieve military supremacy in space over russia among others will it lead to an arms race in space how does russia intend to respond to this development lavrov for many years the united states has remained the only state to block negotiations proposed via a russianchinese initiative at the disarmament conference in geneva on developing a treaty that would ban the deployment of weapons in space this is not about preventing the militarization of space as military satellites are already being launched by us the us and other countries this is a separate matter but deploying weapons in space would be risky and it would lead to unpredictable new threats so we and the chinese offered to make such treaty everyone is ready to begin negotiations it would clearly be a difficult process but we have a draft its pretty welldeveloped and were ready to discuss each of its points and willing to seek the wording that would gain everyones approval and make the document ready for signing the us alone blocks this undertaking in the meantime we perfectly understand the danger of this trend and while the conditions for making a legally binding document come to a head we advance the following political concept we call upon everyone to declare that no country will become the first to deploy weapons in space
https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/yulia-skripal-released-from-british-hospital-following-poisoning-1.3878465,283,13,london the spy saga that has gripped much of britain since march took a positive turn tuesday as nerve agent victim yulia skripal was released from the hospital more than a month after she was poisoned with a militarygrade nerve agent her father sergei remains hospitalized after the poisoning which britain says took place on the orders of the russian government this is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone said dr christine blanshard medical director of salisbury district hospital she said she would not provide details about yulia skripals condition for reasons of patient privacy the yearold has been taken to a secure location blanshard said sergei skripal the apparent target of the attack is recovering more slowly than his daughter but continues to improve both patients have responded exceptionally well to the treatment weve been providing but equally both patients are at different stages in their recovery she said she said no date has been set for the elder skripals release from the hospital the two were poisoned march in an attack that has led to a prolonged confrontation between russia and britain that has revived cold war tensions both were in critical condition for several weeks the british government which accuses russia of carrying out the attack is likely to keep details about yulia skripals location secret given the sensitivity of the case if she is well enough she is likely to be extensively questioned by british security officials and police about her recollection of events leading up to her poisoning the russian embassy congratulated yulia skripal on her release in a tweet but said pointedly that russia needs urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will we are genuinely happy for yulia skripal and wish her a further recovery and rehabilitation we pay tribute to the professionalism of nhs staff at the same time media reports that yulia has left hospital for a secure location cause concern read pictwittercomiqisxzlygv russian embassy uk april russia says it has no role in the attack and has demanded consular access to yulia skripal who has russian nationality it is not clear where the skripals will live if they recover enough to resume normal activities british officials may feel sergei skripal would not be safe to live in the open any longer bob ayers a security analyst who used to work with the cia said it is possible sergei and yulia skripal would be given new identities in britain or the united states under a program like those used to protect witnesses in highprofile criminal trials they could also choose to live in the open under the assumption that russia would not attack a second time he said they may not want to go into hiding ayers said now that the assassination attempt has been uncovered the odds are pretty good the russians wont take another run at them theyll be under surveillance the cops will put cameras up theyll keep good track of the skripals he said he would not expect yulia skripal to return to russia despite her russian nationality in a later tweet the russian embassy said any attempt to settle her in another country would be regarded as abduction secret resettlement of mr and ms skripal barred from any contact with their family will be seen as an abduction or at least as their forced isolation pictwittercomowdtni russian embassy uk april british police say the lethal nerve agent novichok was placed on the door handle of sergei skripals house in salisbury an english cathedral city kilometres west of london the nerve agent also sickened nick bailey a police detective who came to their aid he was the first of the three to be released from the hospital yulia skripal had arrived in england from moscow to spend easter with her father the day before the attack sergei skripal is a former russian military intelligence officer who was convicted in russia of spying for britain he was imprisoned in russia and eventually settled in england after a spy swap he was living under his own name in salisbury apparently believing he would be safe because there was no known history of russia attacking former spies who had been swapped the british government maintains the skripals were poisoned by a militarygrade nerve agent that could only have been made in russia russia has denied the allegation the incident has led to a mass expulsion of russian diplomats from countries aligned with britain russia in turn retaliated by expelling diplomats from countries that sided with britain there are still many unanswered questions about the brazen attack if britain is correct that the russian government is to blame it is not clear why sergei skripal was poisoned now some eight years after his swap some analysts believe russian president vladimir putin wanted to send a message to others who had betrayed russia that they are not safe anywhere in the world others believe sergei skripal might have been involved in some private business that made russian officials uneasy british officials have also not revealed how the novichok was brought into britain

http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/crime/op-ed-many-questions-remain-on-skripal-poisoning-but-press-is-silent/article/520969,287,238,the two were discovered unconscious on a park bench in salisbury on march th according to the official narrative having been poisoned by a novichok type nerve agent that was alleged to have been produced by russia at first it was thought both would die but as it turned out both survived yulia was released on april a statement by the police was released on her behalf but as i pointed out in a digital journal article at the time everything was kept under wraps yulia had been conscious and talking for some time and even had an alleged phone call with a relative viktoria in russia the russian embassy has tried in vain to gain access to yulia as she is a russian citizen victoria too wanted a visa to come to the uk to see yulia but was refused a visa authorities must have interviewed both sergei and yulia about what happened if reports are to be believed yulia has been fit for interrogation for ages it is beyond belief that no such questioning has taken place what were the results surely she and her father are key to help understand what happened after all they were directly involved yet we have not received one bit of information about what she said the father too could be well enough to answer questions there is evidence from the phone call of viktoria that he was out of his coma and asleep however we have not received a single update and reporters are not up to asking questions about his condition apparently reporters who are usually demanding interviews have remained silent and are not clamoring for more news to be released even when yulia was released from the hospital the announcement was made without allowing any reporters to ask questions we do not know where yulia is or the condition of sergei presumably he is still in the hospital but who knows perhaps both have been whisked off and given new identities some have suggested could be done instead of dealing with these questions there are articles dealing with the negative effect on tourism the poisoning has had on the tourism industry in salisbury as in this deutschewelle article and on decontamination as in this bbc article the moon of alabama and craig murray a recent post by blog moon of alabama explains why we may not be receiving any information about what yulia and sergei told authorities about the issue the post notes that a former senior servant clive ponting is quoted by former uk ambassador to uzbekistan craig murray as suspecting that the uk government issued a dnotice to desist from reporting on mr skripals handler murray also noted that alex thomsen on march also mentioned a dnotice related to mr skripals m handler whether there is such an order or not with respect to reporting on what the skripals have said to authorities the situation is as if there were such an order a dnotice is defined by the cambridge dictionary as a british government instruction preventing particular information from being made public in order to protect the country what a complicated web the moon blog post points out the dnotice attempt thomsen mentioned was too late as some media had already reported the name of the skripals mi handler we spelled it out on march one pablo miller a british mi agent had recruited sergej skripal the former mi agent christopher steele was also involved in the case skripal was caught by the russian security services and ewent to jail pablo miller the mi recruiter was also the handler of sergej skripal after he was released by russia in a spy swap he reportedly also lives in salisbury both christopher steele and pablo miller work for orbis business intelligence which created the dirty dossier about donald trump the moon blog wonders if steele got skripal to help make up the dossier about trump did skripals old connections try to contact people in russia to ask about trump dirt of course these are not questions which authorities are likely to answer while we could easily drift into conspiracy theories at this point at the very least if what the moon blog says is true there are certainly those other than the russians who might have motives to poison sergei although it is not clear why yulia should be involved changing official records on april dilyana gatandzhiev tweeted dilyana gaytandzhiev dgaytandzhieva utc apr the skripals were allegedly exposed to the drug fentanyl not the novichok nerve agent according to information obtained from the uk clinical services journal the original version of the report from march said salisbury district hospital declared a major incident on monday march after two patients were exposed to an opioid it followed an incident hours earlier in which a man and a woman were exposed to the drug fentanyl in the city centre the opioid is times stronger than heroin on april a day after the above tweet gaytandzhiev noted that the passage had been redacted moon of alabama blog verified that the text has changed the text now reads salisbury district hospital declared a major incident on monday march after two patients were exposed to what is believed to be an opioidit followed an incident hours earlier in which a man and a woman were exposed to a substance in the city centre all reference to fentanyl as a cause of the illness has been removed strange that a small journal should change its text in this way but it may simply be to be consistent with official findings however the local salisbury journal gave a similar report on march th and that report is still up police declared a major incident after a man in his s and a woman in her s were found unconscious on a bench in the shopping centre on sunday emergency services at the scene suspected the substance may have been a powerful drug called fentanyl but nothing has yet been confirmed of course it was not confirmed another local news site also headlined on march major chemical incident declared after people vomited fentanyl and two are critically ill there have been plenty of technical studies of whatever the agent was and they show that it was a type of novichok nerve agent that the early reports indicate it was fentanyl should hardly count for as much as the official analysis although it remains puzzling why the two did not die and why others saw the symptoms as of fentanyl as the appended video shows a swiss lab analysis pointed to an entirely different agent bz conclusion craig murray along with some others think that there is right now a dorder preventing publication of information about the case if russia is indeed the culprit it would seem that a dorder is the last thing necessary however a uk order if it exists does not prevent the remainder of the press outside the uk from investigating and reporting yet there is silence elsewhere as well

http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/23/give-john-bolton-a-chance/,291,241,that is the task i assigned to myself and it is a daunting one the prevailing reaction i have seen has been sharply negative both in the private messages i have been receiving and the public commentary dominating the media coverage what is the most optimistic take one can offer on president donald trumps decision to replace hr mcmaster with john bolton a former official in george w bushs state department that is the task i assigned to myself and it is a daunting one the prevailing reaction i have seen has been sharply negative both in the private messages i have been receiving and the public commentary dominating the media coverage the conventional view is that this move intensifies the chaos within the white house by bringing in a famously sharpelbowed bureaucratic warrior who is unlikely to get along with his counterparts or perhaps even his boss underscores trumps difficulty in recruiting and retaining top talent confirms a recent trend of replacing mainstream figures who were trusted and respected abroad with ideologues who are better known for staking out extreme positions on cable tv ie gary cohn giving way to larry kudlow tilts the administration in a sharply hawkish direction raising the specter of multiple armed conflicts in the middle east iran asia north korea and possibly china and europe russia the conventional view is not crazy and i would not bet against it still as a congenital contrarian i am left wondering if the conventional view is not missing any silver linings i squinted and found a few not enough to break out the champagne but perhaps enough to delay heading for the bomb shelter you be the judge trump tried to fire mcmaster in a less humiliating way than he did rex tillerson and reince priebus this time trump followed the customary procedure of a private notice followed by paired gracious statements by the firer and the firee the treatment of mcmaster over the past year was still fairly shabby overall but the endgame could have been worse i recognize this is like commenting on the quality of the popcorn at the fords theatre concession stand in april but perhaps worth mentioning anyway mcmasters effectiveness was compromised and vanishing quickly regardless the status quo was not an national security council that was firing on all cylinders but one that was sputtering and perhaps heading toward a full breakdown on balance and grading on the trump curve mcmaster was pretty effective as national security advisor he restored morale on the nsc staff no mean feat given the dire situation when he took over his greatest accomplishment shepherding a serious review of the afghanistan conflict that ended up with the right answer despite the presidents strong predilection to choose the wrong answer is even more impressive in hindsight given how mercurial the president has been his team produced a solid national security strategy in record time one that together with the new national defense strategy might have produced more order on the margins and he helped avert other mistakes such as blowing up the iran nuclear deal without a plan for replacing it but in recent weeks the death watch around mcmaster had become suffocating and the oncehidden interagency struggles too prominent mcmaster had lost the confidence of his boss and his counterparts and as a result would not be able to do his job adequately if he stayed much longer in office bolton is not incompetent and his first name is not general every administration has individuals who are promoted above their competence but trumps team has had more than its fair share in the first few months the preoccupying problem in the trump administration was how to navigate the decisionmaking process with a gang that could not shoot straight even most of boltons critics concede that he was effective in navigating the bureaucracy perhaps more importantly he is a civilian trump has been too quick to reach for the man on horseback to ride to the rescue to fix a personnel problem many of those choices mcmaster john kelly and above all james mattis have been good ones that i have supported but with each new reductio ad militaris trump was politicizing the military and complicating the bedrock principle of civilian control bolton is very much in the pattern of a civilian determined to assert civilian control over the military this augurs for a great deal more civilmilitary friction in the coming months not unlike what was experienced in the barack obama bush and bill clinton administrations so we should not kid ourselves that a man in civvies is an unmitigated blessing as a replacement for a man on horseback but it is a step back toward what might be called regular order in civilmilitary relations rather than abnormal order bolton does not want to destroy the usled international order bolton is on the hawkish end of mainstream views one can find more hawkish voices far from the corridors of power but probably not within them however unlike the steve bannon wing of the trump coalition bolton does not want to destroy the system created by us leaders in the wake of world war ii and then reinvigorated in the wake of the cold war the bannon wing had an apocalyptic view that was exponentially more dangerous something closer to hawkishness on heroin rather than hawkishness on steroids boltons hawkishness on north korea is a strategic concern in the long run but could be a tactical advantage in the short run as every critic has noted bolton has famously advocated for preventive war against north korea clearly making him national security advisor increases the risks of war on the peninsula but in the short run it probably neutralizes the nearterm threat raised by trumps surprise announcement that he would concede to north koreas longcherished desire for a facetoface sitdown with a us president without having to give up anything in return boltons greatest strength is as a ferocious arms control negotiator and this balances trumps great weakness in this same area if there is a diplomatic solution to north koreas nuclear problem a big if then it is more likely to be found with boltons bad cop paired with trumps good cop of course if there is no such diplomatic solution to be found this team is likely to discover that fact sooner than other possible pairings that is a sobering thought bolton corrects even more markedly for trumps unnerving posture of appeasement toward putin boltons hawkishness extends to russia further consolidating the position within the trump administration of those who recognize that putin has been exploiting americas domestic political paralysis and setting back us interests across multiple geopolitical arenas from putins perspective bolton is probably not seen as another useful idiot who can be toyed with hopefully bolton can help trump get onside his own team to create a more effective and responsible russia policy than the one trump has hitherto advanced bolton did not have to shave his mustache trump famously approached personnel recruitment with an insistence that applicants look the part whether trump could ever really afford to indulge the prejudice of lookism i dont think he can afford to now hopefully this is a harbinger that trump will focus on more important criteria as he continues to build out the team reviewing the list i can imagine critics saying the proposed silver linings are hard to see for all the clouds even though i was trying to be as optimistic as possible heres hoping for americas sake that i am still needlessly pessimistic

international law on monday theresa may told the commons it was the largest collective expulsion of russian intelligence officers in history and said more than people could have been exposed to the

of undeclared russian intelligence officers from the uk the russian foreign ministry said this provocative gesture of notorious solidarity with london made by countries that preferred to follow in

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/donald-trump-europe-eu-sergei-skripal-rex-tillerson,306,251,the emerging crisis between the united states and europe is multifaceted its contours fast evolving its outcome hard to predict and if that were true on monday it is more so now following the firing by donald trump of rex tillerson his secretary of state who had unequivocally expressed his horror about the nerve agent poisoning in the uk and openly pledged the solidarity of his office with a european ally the american president by contrast long stayed silent even after theresa may announced that russia was highly likely to be responsible for the attack this merits sustained reflection while several european governments were closing ranks with the uk united in the face of an unprecedented assault involving the use of a military grade substance in a western country the scenario many dreaded was becoming reality not only could trump not care less about the serious concerns of a supposed ally or about russian behaviour he actually seemed content to punish a senior member of his team who had the temerity to show that he did care if there was ever a more dramatic way of demonstrating trumps indifference to the other side of the pond not to mention what brexiters like to believe is an ironclad special relationship this sequence of sorry events was surely it but then the fact of a transatlantic divergence has become progressively more apparent on climate on iran on multilateralism on jerusalem the scene has been set for months tillerson spent the past year as one of a handful of people within the us administration keen to reassure the worried europeans that for all trumps maverick tendencies the fundamentals of the transatlantic relationship were as sound as they had ever been tillersons firing will cause dismay if not complete surprise but it will have its effect not least because it adds further instability to a landscape already churned by trumpinspired shocks last week the us administration launched what can be seen as the first concrete american assault on european interests including british interests since trump came to office the proposed imposition of us tariffs on aluminium and steel there were exemptions mooted for canada and even mexico so often the target of trumps ire but no mention of a special deal for europe that the decision was framed as a question of us national security set off a frenzy of perplexed and angered european reactions with eu officials such as the brussels trade commissioner cecilia malmström rightly asking are europeans not us allies rather than threats to american national security there is no doubt that trumps stance on tariffs represents a turning point for europe it is not words and tweets conversations last weekend at a gathering organised by the german marshall fund thinktank in brussels revealed much about the distress and confusion caused by trumps stance on trade the eu to be sure made clear it was ready to retaliate or to rebalance if a trade war was unleashed but more apparent was the hope that somehow somewhere sane minds would prevail in washington to avert disaster with tillerson out of the picture what are the odds of that now there is no doubt that trumps stance on tariffs represents a turning point for europe it is not speeches and tweets it is concrete action that seems bound by design to harm europe it goes beyond his description of nato as obsolete especially as all the while he was also honouring the alliances troop deployments in the east facing russia it goes beyond his notorious description of the eu as a vehicle for germany to date he hasnt bothered to name a us ambassador to the eu but he hadnt until now translated his hostility for the european construct into consequencefilled acts so what is going on at the brussels gathering robert zoellick a former head of the world bank noted trumps need to pander to his domestic base a fair explanation less publicly however several european officials wondered about the ideological dimension and ambition of trumps offensive against europe hes not just lashing out at european steel hes creating the conditions for a beleaguered eu to split he will watch with glee as brexiters kneel before him again begging for special treatment on trade he will want polands nationalist regime the only one in europe that he has ever lauded to break ranks with angela merkels germany on car exports and other deals perhaps the speculation goes poland will even seek to use its solidarity with the rest of europe on trade as leverage to secure extra eu funds trump may its true be wary of openly granting poland any favours after the scandal triggered by its recent law on the holocaust which denies polish complicity in nazi atrocities but the temptation to bolster a nativist mindset surely still lingers at the back of his mind meanwhile steve bannon trumps former mentor and adviser has been touring europe preaching precisely that message trumps mixture of hostility and indifference to the european project its trading power and its liberal democratic values is hardly news just as his hatred for merkel is no secret but with the early signs of a trade war and the growing evidence of the presidents disdain for britains predicament just when transatlantic empathy was expected we see his estrangement from historical norms in sharp focus whether europe can stay unified in the face of this perilous environment will be a pivotal question add it up the risks for europe if the iran deal unravels the costs of a trade confrontation trumps indifference to russias apparent use of a chemical weapon in europe and now the firing of tillerson and you end up with a gathering crisis of sobering magnitude worse than the useurope rift of over iraq we may yet think fondly of the days when the worst he did was tweet
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/russia-sees-uk-as-weak-because-of-brexit-says-lithuanian-minister,307,187,vladimir putin is testing the uk at what the russian president regards as a time of weakness owing to brexit lithuanias foreign minister has told the guardian speaking after a meeting with the british foreign secretary boris johnson on thursday linas linkevičius said russia saw the uk as increasingly isolated as it prepared to leave the eu russia was testing the uks strength resolve and diplomatic links after the salisbury nerve agent attack he added russia is always looking for weak points and may feel the uk does not feel very strong he said in an interview the russian assumption may be that in the process of brexit the uk is weaker in terms of its isolation and due to brexit the eu will not be very enthusiastic in backing the uk up fortunately that is not the case and we will support the uk but russia acts by testing for reactions linkevičius said the introduction of a british version of the uss magnitsky act one of the sanctions announced by theresa may on wednesday would be very painful for the russian elite adding that the measure had already been introduced in lithuania you know how many oligarchs find safe haven in london their money the real estate the children sent to secondary schools and they cannot imagine their life without that he said can you imagine if people were put on a uk list who already have real estates and property here of course it will be painful linkevičius said putins actions represented a threat to liberal democracy they test and deny i am not asking for escalation but if no clear messages are sent russia regards it as an encouragement to do more lithuania long on the frontline of perceived russian aggression is one of the uks closest allies in combating moscow linkevičius said he expected eu foreign ministers to offer a fullthroated defence of the uk at a meeting on monday at which johnson will seek the blocs support in a joint statement issued on thursday france germany the us and the uk said no country but russia could plausibly be responsible for the attack on the former russian double agent sergei skripal and his daughter in salisbury wiltshire the countries said the nerve agent attack represented an assault on uk sovereignty and demanded russia provide full disclosure of its novichok nerve gas programme to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons britain has alleged that novichok was used in the attack on skripal russia denies being behind the poisoning which also left a british police officer nick bailey seriously ill in hospital on thursday france hardened its support for the uk the élysée palace issued a statement saying the uk assumption that the russian state was responsible was the only plausible explanation for the attack the statement was issued after a phone call between may and the french president emmanuel macron which followed headlines in the british press saying france was undermining the uk by refusing to declare russia responsible the french ambassador to the un françois delattre told the un security council on wednesday that france had full confidence in the british investigation to quickly shed light on the precise circumstances of this use of a chemical weapon linkevičius said he trusted the british explanation of the source of the attack adding if we have a choice we trust our allies it is very hard to trust russia russia denies what it is doing in syria that it has any presence in ukraine and before the annexation of crimea they denied everything he said the salisbury poisoning was a message to future double agents that they will not be safe wherever they go in the world and not just them but also their families unfortunately russian tactics are to test to see what the reaction is and if the response is weak they continue in the same spirit after the invasion of georgia in there was condemnation but very soon it was business as usual that was a lesson learned by them but not a lesson learned by us linkevičius called for the removal of any loopholes in the chemical weapons treaty greater pooling of eu resources on cybersecurity including a rapidreaction team and a shift away from eu dependence on russian gas he said many of europes northern littoral states disagreed with germany which continues to argue that the proposed nord stream gas pipeline from russia to germany over the baltic sea was a purely commercial decision it is very dangerous to give russia a monopoly when you have a single source for energy you are very vulnerable in the moscow military parade a gazprom pipe was on display it was on display for a reason he also called for nato air defence to be stepped up in the baltic states saying the current presence was not sufficient given the buildup of russian weapons linkevičius urged the eu not to relax economic or individual sanctions against russia over its military intervention in ukraine russia denies there is any impact but it is very painful they are trying to divide us and so we must be cohesive

outrage to the coordinated action saying in a statement the allies of britain were blindly following the principle of euroatlantic solidarity in violation of common sense norms of civilized international dialogue and international law the provocative gesture of the socalled solidarity of these countries with london which blindly followed the british authorities in the socalled skripal

https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201803161062614239-skripal-poisoning-theresa-may-uk-russia-threat/,316,259,there are several key facts that were purposefully not mentioned either by the british government or by the russophobic wing of the western media may said in parliament that there are only two plausible explanations for the poisoning case from earlier this month either this was a direct act by the russian state against our country or conceivably the russian government could have lost control of a militarygrade nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others thats blatantly false unless the british government is willing to punish moscow for the dissolution of the soviet union in the novichok chemical agent was developed and tested in nukus uzbekistan according to a new york times article the site was decontaminated in by us specialists but nobody knows who had access to the facility and what could have been smuggled from the facility between and period the maybots now peddling antirussian propaganda on twitter and facebook often use another false claim arguing that only the russian government has the knowhow to produce the novichok nervegas one of the developers of novichok is a soviet defector who has been living in the us for years he had the necessary knowledge to replicate the substance the argument that only the russian government has the required technical facilities needed for novichok production is also false craig murray a former british diplomat quotes one of the novichok creators vil s mirzayanov thus one should be mindful that the chemical components or precursors of a or its binary version novichok are ordinary organophosphates that can be made at commercial chemical companies that manufacture such products as fertilizers and pesticides the whole point of the novichok program was to develop a poison that can be created from easily available components the british government knows that but doesnt want to let the truth get in the way of a good story about the evil russians read more london losing its nerve how uk violates all rules of the diplomatic game the whole scandal recalls the period right before the iraq war politicians government officials and the intelligence community lied to the british public about the proofs of iraqi weapons of mass destruction those lies and omissions of critical information were needed in order to convince the public that a war against iraq was the only moral and rational solution may is basically using tony blairs political playbook the one that successfully got britain into the iraq war the big difference between blair and may is that may is doing her best to get the uk into a military confrontation with a nuclear power one can only hope that a new chilcot inquiry commences before and not after the tory russophobes push britain past the point of no return read more merkel blames moscow but hope it will be part of investigation of skripal case russians are offended by the accusations coming from downing street mainly because they imply that russians are not only evil but also incredibly stupid in mays world russian intelligence services are stupid enough to commit a political murder on foreign soil right before the russian presidential elections and are stupid enough to target a lowlevel defector with a chemical agent known to be created by the soviets thats just impossible the only thing missing in this perfectly russian crime is a balalaika left near the body and a kgb calling card with vladimir putins name on it if something looks like a false flag operation walks like a false flag operation and quacks like a false flag operation it probably is a false flag operation read more russia opens criminal cases over yulia skripals poisoning glushkovs murder given that the british authorities refuse to follow organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons procedures and provide a sample of the poison moscow has valid reasons for both criticism and distrust ancient romans used to begin criminal investigations with the question qui prodest who benefits from the crime it is obvious that putin stands to gain nothing from the skripal poisoning may however has a good chance of saving her political career by using the skripal poisoning as a tool to quash dissent and force the people of britain to rally behind her despite all her flaws and the numerous negative consequences of her leadership it is highly likely that she wants to be remembered as the prime minister who saved britain from the evil russians and not the prime minister who paid billion euro to leave the eu hopefully her attempts at fooling the british people will fail before she drags the uk into a neverending conflict with no winners the views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of sputnik

http://theconversation.com/russian-spy-attack-why-britain-is-limited-in-how-it-responds-to-russia-93252,318,261,it is highly likely that russia was to blame for the attack on former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter using a deadly nerve agent british prime minister theresa may told mps the government is now waiting for a response from russian diplomats before formulating its response though russian foreign minister sergei lavrov has already denied the country is to blame but how can britain respond to the attack in salisbury in a way that shows the public that the government can protect national security while also being effective in the murky world of counterespionage the options are limited and none are likely to be that effective read more nerve agents what are they and how do they work britain is currently part of the eu sanctions regime against russia imposed after its annexation of crimea in these include trade and financial sanctions as well as targeted sanctions against individuals at the heart of the office of russian president vladmir putin the impact of these sanctions on russian government policy is however slim the attack on the skripals bears similarities to the poisoning of alexander litvinenko in with the radioactive agent polonium the government inquest into litvinenkos killing took nearly a decade and in found that putins office was probably at the heart of the decision to kill the former spy the us and uk froze the assets of those deemed responsible for the assassination andrei lugovoi and dmitry kovtum american and european allies jumped forward to support the uk to protest this brazen attack the white house remained silent on the skripal attack for days but donald trump has now indicated that he will be talking to may about it alexei druzhininsputnikkreepa piling on sanctions the eu sanctions could go further though the uks welcoming attitude to russian finance and investment in the city of london has so far been a barrier to this so too has the attitude of many southern eu member states who see russia as a major investor in their economies rather than a territorial or political threat further action would take a major change in the way that the west seeks to counter russia at home and abroad some may argue that escalating sanctions against russia in particularly given the complexity of the quagmire in syria and russias role in supporting the assad regime there might be counterproductive still the uk government is under growing pressure to do something in response to the salisbury attack and the threat to the public health of its citizens in the first instance more sanctions against russian financial assets could be introduced that would mirror the us magnitsky act which has gone further than the eus sanctions in targeting financial interests and corruption close to putin and his closest advisers introduced in the us in the act gives the government powers to put sanctions on people suspected of human rights abuses around the world the problem for the uk would be coming to terms with the scale of russian investment in the uk that would currently contravene the magnitsky act the biggest challenge however would be the near irrelevance of further sanctions at this stage of the contest between the west and russia sanctions are more likely to work at the beginning of a conflict and become increasingly irrelevant the longer it goes on with the first six months of sanctions being the most effective with sanctions against russia in place since a new round is therefore unlikely to have much impact support to russias enemies the uk could also move to counter russian intelligence on uk soil the goal would be to direct uk security services to make it increasingly difficult for russian intelligence operatives to work on the ground and more difficult to get nerve agents or other poisons into the country this has the potential to be more successful in protecting the uk against such brazen attacks than further sanctions would but it could stretch british security services further at a time when global jihadism and cyberattacks are already heaping pressure on counterespionage agencies and it would be done behind closed doors rather than as a public response to the skripal attack an escalation of support for ukraine is perhaps the most likely response even if it is not tied specifically to the skripal attack while current russian military involvement in the donbas region of ukraine has lessened it has continued to support the peoples republics in donetsk and lugansk through material aid and armaments further material aid and armaments for ukrainian forces would be an operationally effective response from the uk though it would not necessarily prevent another attack on the uk the final and least probable response would be a quid pro quo attack on russian intelligence assets in russia itself either counterespionage or a cyber offensive but russia has the potential and wherewithal to escalate this tension between the west and russia even further any attack on russia itself even if targeted at people who spied on the west such as anna chapman the russian spy for who skripal was swapped would further deteriorate the ukrussian relationship the most likely outcome is a combination of further sanctions extra counterespionage as an effective tool for the british security services and further support for ukraine in order to agitate russia through a proxy to avoid open escalation none of these activities are transformative but perhaps neither is the skripal attack although the breaking of a cold war taboo against the use of chemical weapons suggests that the potential for further escalation is increasing while there will be western politicians who call for restraint against further escalation these will be the same politicians who fail to see that russia has transformed what some may call a cold war into something much warmer

demanded the kremlin give answers while it did not name the specific chemical used the opcw said its scientists had confirmed the findings of the united kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical the uk government used its identification of novichok as a major strand of evidence in its decision to blame russia for the attack the military grade nerve agent is of a type known to have been manufactured by russia and would likely have required state resources to produce ministers said russia has strongly denied any involvement in the attack which initially left the skripals in a

designated laboratories of environmental and biomedical samples collected by the opcw team confirm the findings of the united kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical that was used in

wrong please try again later verifyerrors so far so good for theresa may she has won verbal backing from the united states germany and france who have blamed russia for the horrific nerve agent attack in salisbury but there is always a but and this is it the prime minister will find it much harder to translate such pledges of support into action such as tougher economic sanctions against moscow warm words may not be enough in a new cold war the timing could hardly be worse for may which perhaps is one reason why vladimir putin might have sanctioned the attack on british soil the uk has been in the vanguard of eu moves to impose sanctions on russia since it annexed crimea while france and germany have been more equivocal they rely on russian gas and do not want to break ties with moscow however badly it behaves propping up the assad regime as it kills its own people in syria shooting down a passenger plane over ukraine cyber attacks and alleged interference in the us election have not persuaded the eu to tighten the sanctions having attended eu summits where sanctions were discussed i suspect that alongside a recognition that the salisbury poisoning could have happened in paris or berlin there will be a tinge of schadenfreude because of the russian zillions that have flowed into london theresa may we do hold russia culpable for this brazen brazen act and despicable act i doubt may will persuade the eu to opt for tougher sanctions when its leaders meet in brussels next week extending the existing programme perhaps for a year instead of six months might be as good as it gets well never know for sure but brexit probably makes it less likely that the eu will go the extra mile for the uk over russia why would they when were about to walk out the door thats realpolitik nor can the uk rely on the unequivocal support of the us as we could have done with a different occupant in the white house donald trump came on side this week eventually but who can guess his next move not even his closest allies the limitations of the postbrexit global britain strategy are now exposed the crossparty foreign affairs select committee rightly warned this week that it could be viewed as a superficial branding exercise which risks undermining uk interests by damaging our reputation overseas and eroding support for a global outlook here at home the threadbare strategy is based on old friends and new allies the salisbury affair may reveal that the uk cannot rely on old friends to turn supportive rhetoric into tough action and that we have not yet found new allies welcome to the uks new world not so splendid isolation to date may has handled the crisis well and displayed the strong leadership the country expects the same cannot be said for jeremy corbyn at one level one can admire him for sticking to his guns and the moral compass that has guided him on foreign policy for the past years he knew he would face flak from labour mps if he failed to blame russia when may announced the expulsion of diplomats on wednesday his backbenchers had served notice by criticising his approach during a commons statement on salisbury on monday corbyn is no apologist for the putin regime but his equivocation allows his enemies to portray him as such its not about bitter blairites seeking revenge as the corbynistas see it loyalist shadow cabinet members like emily thornberry and sir keir starmer agree with his backbench critics in his article in the guardian today which has dismayed many labour mps who sensed he was shifting to a more sensible position yesterday corbyn warns of a drift to conflict but no one is talking about military action the labour leader has pressed the iraq button but this time it doesnt work russias chemical weapons exist they have been used on british soil the right parallel is not iraq in but argentinas invasion of the falkland islands in a leftwing opposition leader michael foot a founder member of cnd who described himself as an inveterate peacemonger backed the falklands war corbyn did not like his mentor tony benn foot was right sometimes even a peacemonger must talk tough if they aspire to lead the country and maintain a united front with their political enemy in the national interest true public attitudes to foreign invasions have changed since iraq but i doubt they have changed much about what to do when we are under attack corbyns stance on russia may please old friends in his loyal fanbase but it will harm his attempt to win the new allies among voters he will need to win power

russian spy in britain twelve russian diplomats at the united nations in new york and at the russian embassy in washington face expulsion within seven days the united states also ordered the closure of the russian consulate in seattle in a statement white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said the march attack in britain was the latest in russias ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world with these steps the united states and our allies and partners make clear to russia that its actions have consequences she said in two russian scientists approached the posts will englund then the moscow correspondent for the baltimore sun with news of a secret nerve agent video joyce lee will englundthe washington post advertisement russias foreign ministry called the expulsions an unfriendly step that will not pass unnoticed kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov reiterated russias position that it was not involved in poisoning sergei skripal and his daughter yulia with novichok a militarygrade nerve agent developed by the soviet union during the cold war we already stated and reconfirm that russia has never had any relation to this case peskov said adding that after an analysis the foreign ministry would propose retaliatory measures for russian president vladimir putins consideration mondays move marked the most sweeping us purge since the reagan administration ordered diplomats out of the country in it underscored the trump administrations mixed dynamic toward russia involving increasingly tough actions by various agencies paired with the presidents markedly more conciliatory language advertisement only last week president trump called putin to congratulate him on his reelection but did not condemn the poisoning referring to the call russias ambassador to the united states anatoly antonov said the expulsions go against the telephone conversation between our two presidents state department officials said trump signed off on the recommendation to expel the diplomats but was not heavily engaged in the discussion leading up to mondays announcement the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal processes the administration last week began considering expulsions of a minimum of diplomats and state department and white house officials recommended the higher number officials said white house deputy press secretary raj shah did not directly address why trump has not said anything publicly about the expulsions shah noted that while trump did not raise either the poisoning or potential us retaliation in his call with putin last week the president did secure with putin on that call some positive interaction when it comes to nuclear arms advertisement our relationship with russia is frankly up to the russian government and up to vladimir putin and others in senior leadership in russia shah said we want to have a cooperative relationship the president wants to work with russia but their actions sometimes dont allow that to happen the close consultation with european allies was particularly striking given the wedge that trump has driven between the united states and europe in the end european countries ordered russians to leave it was powerful as a statement had they done it unilaterally but it was even more powerful in close coordination with our allies said evelyn farkas a fellow specializing in national security at the atlantic council the coordinated expulsions followed a frenetic weekend of calls among the united states and allies that all announced the expulsions almost simultaneously in a broad attempt to disrupt the kremlins intelligence network across europe larger countries such as canada france germany and poland ordered four russian diplomats to leave most of the rest ousted only one or two russians in a largely symbolic gesture of solidarity advertisement european council president donald tusk said additional measures including more expulsions could be coming senior us officials said they believe that the consulate in seattle which was ordered to close by april has served as a key outpost in russias intelligence operations in part because of its proximity to a us submarine base as well as boeing manufacturing facilities the expulsions reflect the downward trajectory of russias relations with the west already battered by accusations of election interference in the united states and other democracies the rupture along with the anticipated russian titfortat is the most severe diplomatic crisis between the kremlin and the west since russia annexed crimea in ushering in a punishing set of us and european sanctions advertisement in russia where many people had hoped trumps election would bring a thaw in the chilly relationship there has been a sharp reevaluation of trump many russians now see no substantial difference between obama and trump administration policies toward their country said william courtney a retired us diplomat who served in moscow writing in an email from his plane shortly after leaving russia this has disappointed many russians who had thought that trump would be more favorable toward russia than obama had been peskov did not answer a question about how the expulsions would affect the outlook for a russiaus summit the tass news agency reported the kremlin said last week that putin and trump had discussed an upcoming meeting in their call and trump said they would get together soon but senior administration officials have said there are no plans for a summit advertisement antonov said he was called to the state department at am monday and informed of the expulsions by wess mitchell assistant secretary of state for europe in response antonov said he stressed that what the united states of america is doing today is they are destroying whatever little is still left in russiaus relations according to russias interfax news agency state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement we take these actions to demonstrate our unbreakable solidarity with the united kingdom and to impose serious consequences on russia for its continued violations of international norms the cascade of expulsions drew expressions of gratitude from britain which has sought a stiff response to the attack todays extraordinary international response by our allies stands in history as the largest collective expulsion of russian intelligence officers ever will help defend our shared security british foreign secretary boris johnson wrote on twitter russia cannot break international rules with impunity advertisement russia typically responds to such moves with titfortat measures that expel an equal number of diplomats sometimes after a delay of several days as the countrys policymakers consider countermeasures for that reason small nations that have only a handful of diplomats posted to russia may refrain from more extensive expulsions russian embassies around the world sometimes use their twitter accounts to troll their host nations and monday was no exception the russian embassy in washington took to twitter to crowdsource its response us administration ordered the closure

activity was certainly less than many expected russia responded as expected by raising the stakes bringing the british council and consulate in st petersburg into the equation but the subsequent collective action by western countries has taken moscow by surprise and things may be about to get worse for the kremlin with the uk government this week raising the possibility of banning the sale of

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/12/cabinet-may-call-robust-response-syria-chemical-weapons,352,290,the cabinet has unanimously backed theresa mays warning that syrias use of chemical weapons could not go unchallenged leaving the way open for british participation in military action against bashar alassads regime downing street said senior ministers had agreed it was highly likely the syrian government was responsible for the shocking and barbaric gas attack on the rebelheld town of douma which killed up to people within hours of the meeting the prime minister spoke to donald trump by phone about the crisis with the two leaders agreeing to work closely together on the international response they stressed that syria must be prevented from launching a similar onslaught on its own people in future the labour leader jeremy corbyn accused the government of waiting for instructions from the us he said further uk military intervention in syrias appalling multisided war risks escalating an already devastating conflict the government appears to be waiting for instructions from president donald trump on how to proceed but the us administration is giving alarmingly contradictory signals at a twohour cabinet meeting on thursday ministers backed plans to take further action along with the us and france to prevent assads forces from launching such an appalling and inhumane attack again cabinet ministers emerged tightlipped from the unusually long meeting as no awaited the next move from the white house where trump had convened a meeting of his own national security council after the call to the white house no said the prime minister spoke to president trump about syria this evening they agreed that the assad regime had established a pattern of dangerous behaviour in relation to the use of chemical weapons they agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged and on the need to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the assad regime they agreed to keep working closely together on the international response trump was also expected to speak to the french president emmanuel macron about what form the action could take with the white house saying no final decision has been made it is understood the prime minister wants the uk to play a central role in any action rather than just supporting france and the us although preparations are shrouded in secrecy training exercises were clearly already under way at raf akrotiri in cyprus in preparation for a possible counterattack by the russians close allies of the syrian regime however the transport minister jo johnson brother of the foreign secretary told bbcs question time there has been no decision to take military action at this point the prime minister is thought to be unlikely to consult parliament before any coordinated military action which is likely to provoke anger from the opposition benches and to divide the public however the cabinets backing could give her some political cover to take further action after the meeting at no a downing street spokesman said cabinet agreed that the assad regime has a track record of the use of chemical weapons and it is highly likely that the regime is responsible for saturdays attack cabinet agreed it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged they agreed on the need to take action to alleviate humanitarian distress and to deter the further use of chemical weapons by the assad regime cabinet agreed the prime minister should continue to work with allies in the united states and france to coordinate an international response the us defence secretary james mattis said washington was still looking for evidence on who carried out saturdays chemical weapons attack in damascus and said his main concern about a military response was how to stop it escalating out of control however macron said on thursday that his government had evidence that assads

man who was british stressed that he thought it was very important for frith that he complied you see i have your life in my hands the visitor went on to explain that there would be a big problem for frith if he did not talk now the man calmly continued that he worked for british intelligence and that he knew full well that frith worked for russian intelligence he apologised for surprising him out of the blue but explained that it was the only way to talk securely the offer was simple and one that is ageold in the world of espionage to be a double agent working with the uk would be an opportunity to make your life a lot better the british officer assured frith repeatedly insisted that it had been a case of mistaken identity he had nothing to do with spies and he was not russian he was born in ecuador his mother was ecuadorian and his father from new zealand he specialised in socioeconomic aspects of investment the meeting ended with the british man saying he would keep in touch next morning frith flew out of madrid he next surfaced in moscow where sergei cherepanov which was his real identity was welcomed back by his colleagues in the svr the russian foreign security service and reunited with his wife olga and son andrei two russian diplomats based in madrid anton olegovich simbirsky and aleksandr nikolayevich samoshkin were subsequently accused of running cherepanov and expelled from spain the details of how cherepanov was approached by western intelligence and the conversation which took place came later from spanish officials the attempted recruitment had come a day after the fbi had arrested russian agents in boston new york and washington they were sleepers so called illegals who had been in the us since the s pretending to be americans in june a former svr officer colonel alexandr poteyev who had like sergei skripal had served with the military in afghanistan during the russian invasion of the country was sentenced to years in absentia for betraying the anna chapman network and cherepanov there was huge publicity over the case a lot of it focusing on the glamorous anna chapman born anna vasilyevna kushchyenk a russian citizen who had obtained british citizenship by marriage she was later freed in a spyswap under which a russian military intelligence colonel who had become an agent for mi skripal was freed and settled in england with his wife he disappeared from view until as we know the extraordinary murder attempt on him and his daughter yulia with a nerve agent in his adopted hometown of salisbury last weekend chapman who is now a kremlin poster girl model and tv presenter condemned skripal on social media as a traitor the spanish connection runs through the skripal story british and spanish security agencies have been in liaison since the poisoning in salisbury according to a number of sources officials from both countries however refused to comment on the matter skripal was posted to madrid by russian military intelligence gru in cherepanov was already there as frith using the name of a new zealand child who had died young a classic ploy to create a legend in spycraft for three years skripal according to reports had met cherepanov in spain yet his name could not have been passed on to mi among those that skripal supplied to his british handlers if it had been then london would have informed madrid of the spy alternatively the british were told about cherepanov but did not pass on the information to their spanish allies there is a possibility that the two branches of russian intelligence svr and gru were so much out of touch with each other that they were unaware of each others agents but this means accepting not only that skripal did not know cherepanov but was also unaware of the activities of the handlers simbirksy and samoshkin despite being based in the same embassy intelligence analysts are sceptical about this scenario especially at a station like madrid where there would not be that many undercover kremlin operatives unlike washington or london or paris there were certainly marks of official embarrassment over what had happened it took a long time for the details of the affair to

spanish intelligence service calling himself luis befriending him it was already known that skripal was looking for opportunities to make money luis suggested that the two men start a private business exporting spanish wine to russia after a while more money was needed and luis introduced the russian colonel to an mi officer who would become his handler from then on the russian would supply information to the british in return for money cherepanov meanwhile continued with his double life in madrid running his company frimor consultores with a spanish partner and carrying on spying for moscow guided by skripals diplomatic colleagues simbirksy and samoshkin at the end of the nineties skripal returned to moscow to work at gru headquarters he continued to supply information to mi in return for money which became a fairly consistent demand at one point he sent an emergency message to london there was consternation that the russians may be closing in on him and there would be a need for extraction instead it transpired that skripal was urgently demanding the money was sent to him skripal would often fly over from moscow to collect his fees in spain however he suffered from diabetes and sometimes it would be his wife lyudmila who would collect the money instead lyudmila had always maintained that she thought the money was from his private business activities but did the kremlin disbelieve her could that be the reason that she too may have been targeted if indeed it transpires that her death was not due to natural causes endometrial cancer the end to skripals life as a british spy came as it had begun in spain when a russian agent inside the spanish intelligence service roberto florez garcia discovered the military intelligence colonels doublelife and told his

convicted two years later of treason after being charged with betraying dozens of his comrades to mi and was sentenced to years in prison others accused of being traitors in russia had faced far worse fates among them oleg penkovsky a colonel in the gru like skripal who was executed for spying for the british and the americans and dmitri polyakov a majorgeneral in the gru who also faced the firing

but all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to sweden or the czech republic or slovakia or the united states or even the united kingdom i think what people can see is that this is a classic russian strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation theresa may today hit back at russian president vladimir putin today

the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons directorgeneral ahmet uzumcu said johnson called him monday evening to inform him of the results of investigations it is extremely worrying that chemical agents are still being used to harm people those found responsible for this use must be held accountable for their actions he said skripal a former russian military intelligence officer

to push back against alleged kremlin murders on british soil read more in i interviewed a foreign leader who believed he had been poisoned by the kremlin the newly elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko hero of the orange revolution that defeated a candidate backed by russia nearly died after drinking soup laced with dioxin his oncehandsome face was discolored and pockmarked by the poison yushchenko told me the wouldbe assassin was his chef who had fled to moscow where the kremlin rejected any investigation fastforward to now britain just accused russia of responsibility for the poisoning of an exspy sergei skripal and his daughter who were found near death in the city of salisbury the poison used was a rare sovietera nerve agent novichuk which is more lethal than sarin or vx it was invented by russian scientists for use against nato troops moscow brazenly denies involvement this outrageous attack is the latest in a long string of killings or attempted murders of kremlin opponents many in britain some victims were felled by other rare poisons traceable to russia prime minister theresa may has finally pushed back stating the attack represents an unlawful use of force by the russian state against the united kingdom britain has expelled russian diplomats and taken other punitive measures but may needs firm backing from nato and washington to confront moscows blatant attacks on british soil what she needs most is strong public support from president trump so far the president is hewing to his nevercriticizeputin policy instead nikki haley the us ambassador to the united nations made a tough speech wednesday calling the poisoning russias crime and denouncing moscows use of chemical weapons but given the way this white house operates no one can assume any cabinet official reflects the presidents thinking unless trump openly backs may and endorses retaliation against moscow putin will assume he can murder at will consider the boldness of the attack on skripal he was a former double agent who worked secretly for british intelligence was unmasked by russia and imprisoned then freed in a prisoner exchange in which the united states returned eight spies to moscow he lived quietly in salisbury in the old cold war days exchanged spies werent attacked by moscow times have changed the kremlin now seems determined to hunt down its opponents living in britain and elsewhere british experts believe professionals managed to expose skripal to novichuk perhaps in a pub or a restaurant or his car leading to muscle spasms and organ failure a policeman and nearly two dozen civilians were also affected the skripal attack revives memories of the death of alexander litvinenko a putin opponent and naturalized briton he died of polonium poisoning in london british authorities traced the source of this rare element to russia again the kremlin denied all the british response to litvinenkos death was cautious which critics claim encouraged more murders british authorities now intend to investigate other suspicious deaths in britain of kremlin opponents of course this doesnt touch on the use of poisons that have felled several domestic kremlin opponents and journalists or the outright murder of political opposition activists such as boris nemtsov in front of the kremlins walls however the skripal affair is acutely important it illustrates putins utter contempt for nato and western democracies he is clearly testing trying to show that postbrexit britain and nato are too weak to counter such murders several nato governments are now proputin and unwilling to consider new economic sanctions no wonder putin appears unworried about reprisals most important he appears confident trump will refuse to back may no doubt the russian leader recalls trumps shocking interview with bill oreilly last year when oreilly snapped putins a killer trump retorted you got a lot of killers what you think our countrys so innocent candidate trump made his feelings even clearer in december in an interview on morning joe after an effusive round of putin praise from trump joe scarborough noted the russian leader was also a person that kills journalists and political opponents and invades countries trump responded at least hes a leader that kind of thinking seems to underlie trumps reluctance so far to join in mays strong critique of russia over skripal when asked by journalists about the case trump waffled and refused to be drawn in secretary of state rex tillerson took a much stronger stand on the case giving heart to british officials but that was just before he was fired putin respects strength trumps waffling will only convince the russian he can pursue vendettas in the west with impunity it will further fracture nato and undercut relations with britain no wonder the kremlin dismisses the skripal case as a circus show they the kremlin have treated the use of a militarygrade nerve agent in europe with sarcasm contempt and defiance said may on wednesday does donald trump even care trudyrubin

russians go to the polls in a presidential election returns russia to familiar terrain responding to what it sees as aggressive actions by upping stakes in asymmetrical fashion similar moves were seen following the banning of broadcaster russia today from covering the united states congress late last year russia responded by banning the entire us presscorps from the duma parliament likewise the death of a toddler in american foster care was answered with the infamous dima yakovlev law which banned all adoptions by us citizens russia has also been known to hit at what it sees as western sensibilities whether that be adoptive care or the work of ngos while moscow has long been suspicious of the operations of the british council and has harangued the organisation for the best part of a

mr putin personally ordered the assassination attempt dmitry peskov russian presidential press secretary responded to the verbal escalation with a further denial of the states involvement any reference or mention of our president in this connection is nothing but a shocking and unforgivable violation of the diplomatic rules of propriety mr peskov said he said it had become obvious that there is a lack of any clear proof of russian involvement the country has demanded access to the case and opened its own investigation into the attempted murder of yulia skripal it said it would not respond to ms mays allegations until it was given samples of the poison used and such samples were handed to the international opcw russian foreign minister sergey lavrov claimed earlier in the week that a request from russia to access the case materials including a sample of the poison had gone unanswered by britain downing street announced on friday evening that britain had invited opcw experts

views expressed by writers in this section are their own and do not necessarily reflect arab news point of view british prime minister theresa may last week announced that former double agent sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were poisoned with a novichok militarygrade nerve agent developed by russia may said that fact combined with russias record of conducting statesponsored assassinations had led the uk government to conclude it was highly likely russia was responsible for the attackwhat makes chemical attacks such as those in salisbury and in kuala lumpur last year especially alarming is that they contravene the chemical weapons convention those attacks and the freeforall use of chemical agents by the syrian regime against its own people point to the need to revisit cwc enforcement mechanisms curiously in the case of syria russia has singlehandedly stymied efforts to make the assad regime accountable for its atrocious use of chemical weaponsmay meanwhile has offered two possible explanations for the skripal incident either this was a direct act by the russian state or the russian government could have lost control of the nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of othersthe attack took place on march in salisbury a quiet city in southern england russia has denied responsibility for the incident and ridiculed british accusations moscows ambassador to the european union vladimir chizhov suggested that a british laboratory could be the source of the nerve agent he said russia did not stockpile this agent while the porton down lab was only eight miles away from salisburythe uk has announced a set of sanctions and called on others to follow suit a joint statement by the uk united states france and germany strongly condemned russia for the attack but did not announce specific sanctions related to this incident the un security council held an emergency session last wednesday where members condemned the salisbury attack and warned about the danger of proliferation of chemical weapons us ambassador nikki haley said if we dont take immediate concrete measures to address this now salisbury will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used they could be used here in new york or in cities of any country that sits on this councilas expected however the council failed to take action in the face of denial and objections from russia which holds veto powerjust hours after may issued an ultimatum to russia in the house of commons over the salisbury poisonings nikolai glushkov a russian opposition figure was found strangled at his home in london british counterterrorism detectives are treating his death as murder but have not established a direct link to the salisbury attackkremlin critics link more than three dozen deaths and neardeaths in several countries in recent years to political assassinations by russian agents the weapons of choice were usually bullets but have also included such methods as radioactive tea toxic umbrella tips tainted letters poisonous essence of flowers and now a militarygrade nerve agent the victims include politicians businessmen journalists and whistleblowers russia has denied responsibility for these acts but curiously has not conducted credible public inquiries into them to demonstrate its innocencerussia is not alone in february the older halfbrother of north koreas leader kim jongun was assassinated by smearing a nerve agent on his face while traveling through kuala lumpur international airport the rogue regime of north korea was believed to be behind the killing of its presidents estranged siblinginternational law is quite clear on crossborder assassinations they are serious crimes regardless of their motives or who the victims may be states are within their rights to request the extradition of those suspected of committing crimes and then giving them a fair trial states may not violate other countries sovereignty and kill or harm their opponentsthese increasingly recurring cases threaten to erode the international prohibition against the use of chemical weapons which was thought to be one of the most sacrosanct postulates of international law after the atrocities of the two world wars where various poisonous gases were freely used by the warring factions it was thought humanity had evolved beyond the use of those abhorrent weaponsthe organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons was established in its membership includes almost the entire un representing about percent of the worlds population in other

inspections consultations could be bilateral between two states britain and russia in this case or multilateral through the executive council the other option is challenge inspections and investigations to be conducted by the opcws technical secretariatrussia has denied responsibility for the salisbury attack but since the nerve agent used was developed as part of the soviet unions offensive chemical warfare program it has been inherited by the russian federation as such there is a moral if not a legal duty to cooperate with the investigation and to account for that agent and prevent its proliferationuntil a thorough investigation is carried out by the opcw the main international body responsible for chemical disarmament suspicions will linger and fears of yet another

the daughter of a former russian spy poisoned in britain deleted online family photos so no other loved ones could be tracked down a friend has revealed yulia skripal the daughter of exspy sergei skripal has only just been released from hospital after being found critically ill alongside him on a bench in salisbury wiltshire on march her best friend irina petrova said she was surprised to hear miss skripal was in england without telling her because she usually told her when she went abroad she added that miss skripal her best friend of years did not tell her when her mother or brother died in a series of family tragedies miss skripals mother liudmila died in aged one year after she and mr skripal had bought a semidetached home in salisbury then four years later her brother alexander also died in st petersburg but there have been conflicting reports over the circumstances of their deaths ms petrova told grazia magazine year after year everybody was dead it was so quick i found out from my mother who bumped into yulia in the street in moscow her best friend irina petrova pictured in grazia said she was surprised to hear miss skripal was in england without telling her because she usually told her when she went abroad i asked what happened and she told me it was cancer after the mysterious death of her brother i was shocked he was a big healthy guy after that she deleted all photos with relatives from her social media maybe so no other loved ones could be tracked down she used to post a lot of photos of her brother and her father she added that miss skripal might have deliberately held off having children saying she loved kids but its a difficult life if you look at whats happened she couldnt predict anything ms petrova also told how her best friend was often home alone in moscow because her boyfriend worked night shifts in what she describes as a special government organisation she said she did not know him and he does not have a social media presence adding because of his job he isnt allowed to travel abroad miss skripal the daughter of exspy sergei skripal pictured together has only just been released from hospital after being found critically ill alongside him in salisbury last month miss skripals mysterious fiance was named for the first time last week as stepan vikeev but he has had no contact with her or her family since the attack the friend also said that when she first heard about the salisbury attack she thought this cant be yulia i didnt even know she was in england asked whether miss skripal would usually tell her when she made a trip abroad she added yes of course she told me when she went to england for new year in but i suppose she doesnt have to tell me about her every step miss skripal hadnt worked at pepsico the company she told her best friend she worked at for more than a year ms petrova said this was pretty strange but admitted that her friend had been private and an introvert and speaking about her cousin viktoria who wants to take miss skripal home to russia now she said she found it strange adding viktoria wasnt too close to yulia police stand outside the home of former russian spy mr skripal in salisbury last month miss skripal has told british authorities she does not wish to speak to russian officials as she continues to recover from a nerve agent attack a diplomatic battle has been raging between the two nations over whether the russian embassy should be allowed access to her ms skripal found critically ill alongside her yearold father on a bench last month was discharged from a hospital in salisbury this week it is believed that british authorities immediately took her away to a secure location the embassy reacted angrily to the news suggesting in a series of tweets that the russian national had been taken against her will however it is understood that the offer of consular support from russia was presented to ms skripal and rejected miss skripal has told british authorities she does not wish to speak to russian officials as she continues to recover from a nerve agent attack that was also carried out on her father she is believed to have expressed no interest in talking to consular officials russia remains the prime suspect for carrying out the attack on mr skripal and his daughter a spokesman for the foreign and commonwealth office said we have previously passed on the russian embassys offer of consular support to yulia she is free to decide on whether she wishes to pursue that to date we understand she has not done so the embassy remains perturbed by a refusal from uk authorities to grant ms skripals cousin viktoria a visa to visit her family it escalated the war of words on tuesday saying in a series of statements posted on social media secret resettlement of mr and ms skripal barred from any contact with their family will be seen as an abduction or at least as their forced isolation ms skripals release from hospital was met with a similar broadside from the embassy which has repeatedly criticised the handling of the investigation into the attack police stand next to a cordon in salisbury following the poison plot in the city last month in a statement a spokesman said we congratulate yulia on her recovery yet we need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will continuing the onslaught of scepticism yesterday morning it suggested reports ms skripal had turned down consular assistance actually revealed she is being held hostage by the same people who destroy evidence and fail to come up with a single official account of the crime the full interview with irina petrova appears in this weeks grazia which is on sale now russian foreign minister sergey lavrov previously said it was outrageous that britain had failed to provide consular access to ms skripal as news of her improving condition was announced earlier this month her release from hospital was announced by salisbury district hospital medical director dr christine blanshard yesterday she said both patients have responded exceptionally well to the treatment weve been providing but equally both patients are at different stages in their recovery i want to take this opportunity to wish yulia well this is not the end of her treatment but marks a significant milestone she added although he is recovering more slowly than yulia we hope that he too will be able to leave hospital in due course the former double agent was jailed in russia for selling secrets to mi but was released as part of a spy swap deal in and settled in the uk it is hoped he will soon be fit for release from hospital despite grave fears that the exposure to militarygrade nerve agent novichok on march would prove fatal britain has said that russian state involvement is the only plausible explanation for the attack and has led a worldwide reaction involving the expulsion of more than diplomats the full interview with irina petrova appears in this

president bashar al assad is to blame for a barbaric chemical attack on civilians the prime minister told donald trump last night she backed an international response to the attack and would work with allies to find out what happened but the downing street account of the call with the us president said an attack should only go ahead of syrian culpability is confirmed a white house report of the call did not make the same point in an incendiary tweet today mr trump warned russia to get ready because american cruise missiles will be coming alarmed british mps were critical of mr trumps tone but advocates of striking back at assad over the gas attack said it proved the value of british involvement mrs may is under growing pressure to call a commons vote before joining any military alliance against syria in line with conventions established since the iraq war mailonline understands mps have not yet received calls from whips to find out if they could return to westminster before mondays next scheduled sitting theresa may was last night warned not to press ahead with a strike on bashar al assads troops without a commons vote mps said it would be a huge mistake for the pm to bow to pressure from the us and intervene in the syrian conflict without their backing the pm held talks with emmanuel macron and donald trump on the phone yesterday amid growing speculation that a western coalition is being put together to strike back at assad for the chemical attack in an incendiary tweet today mr trump warned russia to get ready because cruise missiles will be coming mrs may mr trump and french president emmanuel macron agreed yesterday that there would be a retaliation to the attack that has provoked international fury and condemnation the us president promised a forceful response to the douma attack and has spoke about options for military intervention he has appeared to move forward with plans to hit syrian regime forces moving resources towards the middle east and putting pressure on britain to join possible action in his tweet today mr trump said russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria get ready russia because they will be coming nice and new and smart you shouldnt be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it tory mp johnny mercer replied this is the reason why we must build influence and yes lead coalitions to make a calm but very robust stand for what we believe in whilst tempering unhelpful rhetoric so we dont repeat the mistakes of the past there is a balance and therein lies britains role in this michael fabricant said it is not diplomatic but the final sentence is certainly true tory mp johnny mercer replied this is the reason why we must build influence and yes lead coalition x michael fabricant said it is not diplomatic but the final sentence is certainly true however mrs may indicated she needed proof the syrian dictator was behind the attack before ordering a strike does may need to call a commons vote on striking syria theresa may was constitutionally entitled to order british forces into action in syria without a commons vote the prime minister has the power to deploy troops under the royal prerogative there are no hard and fast rules obliging the government to involve rankandfile mps in the decision but a vote on prolonged deployment of uk forces would be almost impossible to avoid commons divisions have been held on almost all military action by british forces since the iraq war in establishing what many see as a firm convention advertisement ad she said the attack was another example of the assad regimes brutality but added the caveat if confirmed she said president assad and russia would be held to account if they are found to be responsible for the attack which left at least people including children dead mps have approved air strikes on islamic state in syria but not on russianbacked regime forces in the commons voted against bombing assad over chemical weapon strikes by a majority of a repeat of the defeat in the commons lobby would be humiliating for mrs may but she may be advised it is politically impossible to ignore the vote either since the iraq war a precedent has been set that all military action abroad is first approved by parliament but it has not always been followed if they are not recalled early mps are due to be back in westminster following the easter recess on monday afternoon despite many mps and ministers backing the pm to act without a vote others warned doing so could trigger a row mrs may indicated she needed proof the syrian dictator was behind the attack before ordering a strike she said the attack was another example of the assad regimes brutality but added the caveat if confirmed britain has a variety of military options it could bring to any action against president assads regime in syria but it appears mrs may might be resigned to taking responsibility along with her cabinet rather than waiting for mps to return from the easter recess exarmy chief says attack on syria must be at scale general sir richard barrons commander joint forces command from april until april today warned any strikes on syria needed to be at scale with allies and if necessary repeated until conditions change he told bbc radio s today programme well i think the likely outcome is that action will be taken because it must be taken i hope but i cant be sure of course that this extends beyond the tokenism of previous attempts which have been an act of event management and limited by scale and by time asked if any joint action could take out syrias chemical weapons capability general sir richard said the capability exists given enough time and effort to identify where the chemical weapons stocks are and the delivery means which are mostly aircraft and then over time to begin to strike at them from range and that i guess is whats under consideration and youre not going to do that completely but you are going to make a difference over time asked if this could be done in a way that would avoid hitting russian aircraft in syrian air bases he replied in terms of the technology of precision targeting yes that can be done but the chances of if you like collateral damage are very high a former head of the army said diplomatic efforts must continue alongside any action over the suspected chemical weapon attack in syria its got to be within the overall context of a bigger diplomatic effort to get the parties around the table to end the syria civil war lord dannatt told itvs good morning britain a strike on its own would just be a strike and potentially nothing else advertisement ad as decisions on deploying armed forces come under a royal perogative she does not technically have to seek parliaments permission before ordering airstrikes while there is a precedent to gain the support of the fellow mps before taking such drastic action the move spectacularly backfired on david cameron in it comes as the daily telegraph reports boris johnson is among those influential mps to believe mrs may can act without her mps to support the backing of trump and macron in attacking assads forces commons defence committee chairman julian lewis who did not back action against assad in told mailonline when we are contemplating military intervention in other peoples conflicts parliament ought to be consulted and his fellow tory mp john baron said any substantial military commitment should be approved by parliament former lib dem leader tim farron said there is a strong case for military action in syria we cannot continue to shrug our shoulders as assad commits despicable crimes against the innocent but theresa may would be making a huge mistake if she decides to follow donald trump and commit our country to action without consulting our sovereign parliament first labour mp chris bryant who sits on the commons foreign affairs committee said it would be bizarre to go ahead with strikes without mps backing especially since the last two times we looked at this it proved to be highly contentious across all parties kay hutchison us permanent representative to nato told sky news yesterday that assad ally russia should do something to stop this kind of genocide though mr trump said on monday that major decisions would be made in the following to hours mr macron said yesterday that france would take the coming days to decide with the us and britain how to respond other mps said there did not need to be a vote for what would be a limited oneoff strike

responsibility along with her cabinet rather than waiting for mps to return from the easter recess former aid minister priti patel said inaction has become a stain on our collective humanity we have reached the moment when the world must see justice done tory mp tom tugendhat who chairs the foreign affairs committee said that un and geneva protocols gave the government the authority to act without a vote aid minister penny mordaunt said discussions were ongoing over a possible military response by britain and its allies that would prevent repeats yesterday the mail revealed military

to send a team on a factfinding mission to douma on the outskirts of damascus meanwhile mikhail gorbachev expressed great concern over the mounting tensions in syria the exsoviet president warned

support britains version of events it is believed that british authorities immediately spirited ms skripal away to a secure location when she was discharged from hospital earlier this week the russian embassy reacted angrily suggesting in a series of tweets that the russian national had been taken against her will the kremlin has repeatedly attempted to challenge britains claims that it was responsible for the poisoning of the skripals war of words as diplomatic battle continues to rage the russian embassy is perturbed by a refusal from uk authorities to grant ms skripals cousin viktoria a visa to visit her family it escalated the war of words on tuesday saying in a series of statements posted on social media secret resettlement of mr and ms skripal barred from any contact with their family will be seen as an abduction or at least as their forced isolation but ms skripal said in a statement i have specially trained officers available to me who are helping to take care of me and to explain the investigative processes that are being undertaken i have access to friends and family and i have been made aware of my specific contacts at the russian embassy who have kindly offered me their assistance in any way they can at the moment i do not wish to avail myself of their services but if i change my mind i know how to contact them most importantly i am safe and feeling better as time goes by but i am not yet strong enough to give a full interview to the media as i one day hope to do until that time i want to stress that no one speaks for me or for my father but ourselves i thank my cousin viktoria for her concern for us but ask that she does not visit me or try to contact me for the time being her opinions and assertions are not mine and they are not my fathers the russian embassy later said that the statement raises new questions rather than gives answers as it was unable to verify it the text has been composed in a special way so as to support official statements made by british authorities and at the same time to exclude every possibility of yulias contacts with the outer world consuls journalists and even relatives the embassy said in a statement the document only strengthens suspicions that we are dealing with a forcible isolation of the russian citizen pair poisoned by novichok experts conclude theresa may has said that uk military experts at porton down found that they were poisoned by novichok a nerve agent developed by russia and that the only plausible explanation was that the russian state was responsible despite the denials from

area where mr skripal is being kept for his treatment for novichok exposure but cannot get inside because the door is securely closed the spokesman said this footage shows appalling behaviour on the part of these russian journalists approaching staff in the middle of the night with no warning and without asking for any permission our staff who have been rightly lauded for their recent efforts

cordoned by tapes and local residents continue to get treatment here the journalist is seen attempting to interview police officers only to be given the brush off eventually he is told to leave by

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/russia-demands-nerve-agent-samples-uk-deadline-spy-poisoning,444,24,russia has summoned the uks ambassador to moscow to protest against accusations that it ordered last weeks nerve agent attack in salisbury and to warn that any british sanctions against russia would be answered in kind among other measures moscow is ready to ban all british media outlets if london revokes the statefunded russia todays right to broadcast in britain a spokeswoman for the russian foreign ministry said on national television on tuesday evening not a single british media outlet will work in our country if they close russia today maria zakharova said a foreign ministry statement said it had summoned laurie bristow the british ambassador to also declare that russia would not comply with theresa mays demand that it explain its role until the russian government had been given samples of the nerve agent that left sergei skripal and his daughter yulia critically ill without this any statements by london are senseless the ministry said in the statement given to journalists may said in parliament on monday that the uk would consider punitive measures if russia did not meet a deadline of the end of tuesday to explain itself possibilities include revoking the broadcast licence of the russian statefunded broadcaster rt expulsions of diplomats or greater scrutiny of russian investments in the uk the russian foreign ministry said any threats to adopt sanctions toward the russian federation would not remain without a response with britain and russia at an impasse it is likely the next steps will involve titfortat reprisals between the two countries russias foreign minister sergei lavrov said during a televised press conference earlier that russia was not responsible for the poisoning and demanded that britain seek to mediate the case under the chemical weapons conventionwe have already made our statement on this case he said russia is ready to cooperate in accordance with the convention to ban chemical weapons if the united kingdom will deign to fulfil its obligations according to the same convention in his remarks lavrov said that under the convention russia would have days to reply to an official accusation by the uk over the use of a banned substance within its borders his response reflected the broadly dismissive tone adopted by the russian establishment on tuesday we have an enormous government here in russia its a global country we have a mass of problems both internal and external andrei klimov the deputy head of the russian federation councils foreign affairs committee told the guardian by telephone this entire story about your internal scoresettlings and scandals doesnt interest me a representative of the british embassy in moscow said bristow would visit the russian foreign ministry on tuesday for talks with vladimir titov the first deputy minister for foreign affairs may told parliament on monday it was highly likely that russia was responsible for the act against sergei and yulia skripal she named the poison used as novichok a sovietera nerve agent theresa may highly likely russia is behind salisbury spy attack video russian officials remain defiant towards the uk at least in public accusing britain of succumbing to its own russophobia and saying they could handle the situation however may decides to respond asked whether he and colleagues would be watching when may spoke after the deadline klimov said god no im going to find out from journalists like you zakharova called mays remarks on monday a circus show vladimir putin asked by the bbc whether russia was behind the skripal poisoning said get to the bottom of things there first then well talk about this quick guide what is novichok show novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the soviet union in the s and s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons like other nerve agents they are organophosphate compounds but the chemicals used to make them and their final structures are considered classified in the uk the us and other countries the most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than vx the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents which include sarin tabun and soman novichok agents work in a similar way by massively overstimulating muscles and glands treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents namely with atropine diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes the chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in by vil mirzayanov a former russian scientist living in the us but the structures have never been publicly confirmed it is thought they can be made in different forms including as a dust aerosol the novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal after mixing two otherwise harmless components according to mirzayanov they are to times more toxic than conventional nerve agents photograph matt cardygetty images europe was this helpful thank you for your feedback the breakdown of relations with the uk comes at a sensitive time for russia politically with putin set to be reelected for a fourth term on sunday he is scheduled to address supporters on wednesday in crimea the peninsula whose annexation from ukraine in set off a chill in relations between russia and the west since then putin has survived several international scandals including the downing of the mh plane over east ukraine and accusations of meddling in the us presidential elections in some cases the growing conflict with the west and a siege mentality at home appear to have boosted his ratings the russian senator konstantin kosachev wrote on tuesday that the west has regularly condemned russia without its input he said weve made a decision here investigated it ourselves delivered our own verdict and sentence and russia should defend itself without any evidence or participation in the process no one has suggested that russia is gathering evidence to help british investigators klimov argued that russia had no motive to attack skripal and suggested other former soviet countries could be behind the attack in denying the allegations he also issued a warning saying i would just like to tell russians who hope to hide in great britain from bad russians one thing its going to be very unsafe for you its long since become a place where bad things happen this isnt moscows fault something is happening over there

a standard buzzfeedstyle digital media knockoff there is however one distinct difference between icymis videos and any other twominute news blast on youtube host polly boikos monologues are part of russia today the englishlanguage media company known as rt and backed by the russian government nbc news discovered the connection through registration information of icymis website which lists the same entity as the registration for rts website most of icymis videos have the same look boiko stands in front of a green screen with bright bouncy graphics and a comicbookstyle font as she speaks into the camera about various news topics in one video she recaps events including the olympics and the oscars other videos labeled quickies feature quirky stories like marijuana dispensary security guards who claimed mice stole the companys stash but in between those fun videos about internet oddities the channel publishes diatribes from boiko about international scandals pushing the same talking points as those found on other russiabacked channels such as russia today in one video boiko discusses the poisoning of uk double agent sergei skripal and his daughter with users having no clear way of knowing about the videos connection to russias media efforts in another boiko in a dark side of the moon pink floyd tshirt complains that the west blames russia for all of its problems polly boiko clad in a dark side of the moon pink floyd tshirt complains that the west blames russia for all its problems icymi via youtube behind slick graphics and poppy background music icymi has managed to evade youtubes new efforts to identify russian propaganda for over three months icymi is featured on rts shows page icymi showcases the increasing complexity of russias efforts to spread its talking points across the internet often in ways that make it nearly impossible to identify such channels as being backed by a foreign country the internetsavvy content looks and sounds like many other popular youthoriented media brands helping it avoid youtubes new policy of placing banners that denote acceptance of government funding while building up an audience in february youtube said it would start labeling videos created by the russian government like ones pushed by rt with a disclaimer that says the channel is funded in whole or in part by the russian government along with a link to rts wikipedia page in november rt said it would comply with requests from the justice department to register as a foreign agent icymi does not have that disclaimer nbc news reached out to youtube about icymis ties to the russian government asking how the company went about identifying propaganda accounts unfortunately we dont comment on specific channels a youtube spokesperson said the company did not respond to followup questions about the channel icymi launched on youtube facebook twitter and instagram in january and its most recent facebook video about skripals poisoning drew more than views in five days in that video boiko a former rt reporter falsely claims that uk labour party leader jeremy corbyn had said russia definitely didnt poison skripal corbyn has said he is seeking incontrovertible evidence that the kremlin carried out the attack but has made no definitive claims this beardy pacifist says russia definitely didnt do it boiko says of corbyn and the skripal poisoning in one video but do you want to believe someone whos been fighting for human rights his entire life anna belkina deputy editorinchief and head of communications for rt confirmed that icymi is part of rt and said that it takes issue with youtubes characterization of content on rts channels icymi is prominently featured as a show on the rtcom website and is helmed by a wellknown rt reporter belkina wrote although youtube elected to add channel information to accompany videos from certain outlets that exist on their platform it remains purely the choice of the platform to do this and we dont always agree with their selective classification of some channels with certain prejudicial language boiko declined to comment russias backing icymis website icymitv was registered on jan to the same entity as rts official website icymitv and kubmedia a russianlanguage propaganda site were both purchased by the russian propaganda network this year clint watts a former fbi counterintelligence agent who testified before congress about russias disinformation campaign last year called icymi a prime example of russia catching up with the new rules created by tech giants to limit the reach of its propaganda the idea with the most advanced actors is to play to the terms of service to play within the new terms watts said theyre gonna keep adapting and these companies are going to keep adapting to the propaganda channels polly boiko discusses the poisoning of uk double agent sergei skripal and his daughter without users knowing about the videos connection to russias media efforts icymi via youtube watts called it an exploit saying social media companies will have to be as creative as the propaganda outlets trying to find loopholes in their service it takes a lot of research but with the social media companies theyre going to have to chase this watts said the most persistent information threats like rt are always going to identify the terms of service and then do what they can to get around them this is not the kremlins first shot at creating offbrand versions of popular online american news outlets in the now an imitation of popular startup nowthis news that has its own section of rtcom stripped all of its rt branding from its channels in it also registered its website inthenowmedia using rts domain registration address in on twitter in the now

responsible for this months chemical weapons attack in douma overt russian government outlets like rt and sputnik had been pushing the same theory in the past week spreading doubt over assads use of chemical weapons on his own people has been a staple of russian media outlets over the past several years andrew feinberg who quit his job as white house correspondent at sputnik in protest of what he believed were topdown orders to push russias talking points said he recognized the mix of regular news and propaganda he said he was asked by superiors to pose a question about a syrian chemical weapons attack in khan shaykhun at a white house news conference last year feinberg said that at sputnik to percent of stories are just regular news stories and some stuff theyre actually really good at covering but that they sneak in government information under the guise of balance thats what happens there they try to mix in propaganda with news and hide behind calling it news he said they dont present it as propaganda to people that work there they present it as telling the other side feinberg now managing editor at broadbandbreakfastcom a washingtonbased news organization said that the

http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-fg-us-russian-20180326-story.html,458,361,the white house on monday announced the most aggressive diplomatic slapdown of russia since the end of the cold war but president trump rarely shy about claiming credit for his administrations bold action remained quiet offering no tweets or public statements about the retaliatory measures the us expulsion of alleged russian spies operating under a cloak of diplomacy and the closing of moscows last diplomatic outpost on the west coast came in response to the nerve agent attack on a former soviet spy and his daughter in britain earlier this month that british and us intelligence agencies blamed on the russian government the move was announced in coordination with more than a dozen european allies and received bipartisan praise from lawmakers diplomats and foreignpolicy experts in what is normally an uncompromisingly bifurcated political atmosphere advertisement all russians based at the russian embassy in washington and elsewhere and at the united nations in new york are intelligence agents cloaked by diplomatic disguise said a senior administration official who briefed reporters in advance on condition of anonymity the order also includes closing the russian consulate in seattle the us action followed earlier decisions by britain to expel of the russian diplomatic staff there other countries joining in mondays action against russia included members of the european union and several former soviet baltic states germany and france expelled four diplomats each poland four ukraine lithuania three canada also joined the coordinated action saying it would expel four russians and reject the applications of three others identified as intelligence officers or individuals who have used their diplomatic status to undermine canadas security or interfere in our democracy jon huntsman jr the trumpappointed us ambassador to russia said the administrations decision monday represented the largest expulsion of russian intelligence agents in united states history in a statement the white house said trump had ordered the expulsions to make the united states safer by reducing russias ability to spy on americans and to conduct covert operations that threaten americas national security the seattle consulate was ordered closed because of its proximity to one of our submarine bases and boeing the statement said in language unusually harsh for the trump administration where russia is concerned the statement added that moscows use of a militarygrade chemical weapon on british soil was the latest in its ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world notably however trump did not immediately make a statement in his own voice no public appearances were scheduled for monday nor did he speak to reporters while at his resort in florida over the weekend and white house principal deputy spokesman raj shah said the administration remained open to working with russia the president wants to work with russia shah said at the regular white house briefing monday but their actions sometimes dont allow that to happen normally a move as monumental as expelling foreign operatives would be accompanied by a formal unveiling by the president or senior officials of his cabinet by evening trump had tweeted only three times once about the economy another about the stock market and one on an undetermined topic presumably his alleged affair with an adult film star in so much fake news never been more voluminous or more inaccurate but through it all our country is doing great he has so far refused to personally condemn vladimir putin for the attack instead calling the russian leader recently to congratulate him for his victory in a dubious election trump was slow to publicly acknowledge russian complicity in the poisoning which critically injured sergei skripal and his adult daughter yulia on march in the british city of salisbury a white house official also briefing reporters on condition of anonymity insisted the order monday was absolutely trumps decision but it stood in marked contrast to trumps own description last week of a very good call with putin and plans to meet him in a summit to discuss the arms race his spokeswoman said at the time that the skripal attack did not come up in the call last year the administration ordered russia to close its consulate in san francisco an iconic building and the oldest russian diplomatic mission in the united states that order left seattle as the only russian diplomatic post on the west coast it came as part of a titfortat dispute between moscow and washington over economic sanctions approved overwhelmingly by congress but only reluctantly enacted by trump the sanctions then were in response to russias meddling in the election campaign foreign policy experts said the expulsions were significant and sent a strong message to russia however several advocated measures that would more directly target money controlled by putin and the oligarchs and business tycoons who surround him the expulsion of russian diplomats alone is unlikely to deter russia from its aggressive behavior said michael carpenter a former national security council director for russia during the obama administration who is now at the atlantic council think tank a strong response would impose financial sanctions on russia he added including iranstyle bans on russias participation in global financial institutions and markets and an end to construction of the billion nord stream gas pipeline through europe russia immediately responded to mondays action with threats of reciprocal retaliation presumably the expulsion of us diplomats from already diminished missions in russia we already stated and reconfirm that russia has never had any relation to this skripal case putin spokesman dmitry peskov told the tass russian news agency we will be guided by the principle of reciprocity as before the russian foreign ministry said in a statement that the provocative gesture by the united states and its allies was continuation of the confrontational policy to escalate the situation countries had chosen to blindly follow the principle of euroatlantic unity at the expense of common sense the ministry said repeating claims that britain had not supplied evidence of russian involvement in the poison attack members of the us congress almost universally welcomed the administrations move including those lawmakers who have criticized trump for failing to challenge russia sen robert menendez dnj ranking member of the senate foreign relations committee praised what he called long overdue steps and urged a comprehensive strategy to counter the russian states reprehensible behavior it is long past time for the administration to take this national security threat seriously menendez said the expulsion decision also represents the united states complete rejection of russias denial of involvement in the attack said sen lindsey graham rsc sen john mccain rariz a frequent critic of trump welcomed the expulsions as an important step forward but added while todays decision sends an important signal to moscow the only way to ensure putin and his cronies feel the consequences of their brazen actions is by punishing them financially the us ambassador to the united nations nikki haley who has long been more hawkish on russia than trump also praised the removal of the russians especially of the dozen from un headquarters there she said russia has found a safe haven for dangerous activities within our own borders despite trumps apparent affinity for and reluctance to criticize putin most of his senior advisors have long advocated a tougher stance including two who just departed secretary of state rex tillerson whom trump fired on march after he spoke especially harshly about moscows actions and national security advisor hr mcmaster who stepped down on thursday they are being replaced by veteran politicians known for hardline foreignpolicy views including regarding russia cia director mike pompeo for tillerson and former un ambassador john bolton for mcmaster but it seems unlikely they had a role in mondays decision which had been in the works for some time officials said the russian diplomats and intelligence operatives have been given a week to depart the united states with their families meanwhile the russian embassy in washington posted a twitter poll inviting followers to help decide which us consulate in russia should be shut down in retaliation vladivostok st petersburg

salisbury were fearful and that the government should have been more open about what the city faced earlier he was backed by some members of the public who have contacted the guardian to said they did not feel they had the right information early enough and that a hotline should be launched for anyone with health concerns the focus of police and military attention has widened to a village just

blindsided by the salisbury attack he said there are not many people around with current and deep experience of things like this i also think this is symptomatic of the fact that chemical weapons have become the norm we havent done anything about the use of chemical weapons in syria and iran now were paying the price if the russian president vladimir putin is responsible he probably doesnt think

quickly pinned the blame on russia so did us secretary of state rex tillerson in what ultimately became one of his last public statements before being fired but at the white house president donald trumps initial response was more circumspect in his first remarks on the incident mr trump told reporters on tuesday morning it sounds to me that it would be russia based on all the evidence they have he added a qualification however as soon as we get the facts straight if we agree with them we will condemn russia or whoever it may be mr trumps spokeswoman pointedly avoided naming russia as the likely perpetrator of the attack tougher rhetoric came only on wednesday evening when white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders put out a statement saying the us stands in solidarity with its closest ally and shares britains assessment that russia is responsible for the reckless nerve agent attack for us allies and some congressional lawmakers it was another befuddling example of the president appearing to softpedal in the face of moscows provocations some russia watchers said the fact that the us had to play catchup to align itself with the british was glaring particularly at a time of uncertainty over the trajectory of american foreign policy its striking the contrast between what the brits have done and what the us has not done said angela stent director of georgetown universitys center for eurasian russian and east european studies stent said that while its unlikely the us would levy new sanctions on russia over an incident on british soil you would still expect solidarity from washington the pressure on mr trump to forcefully respond to the poisoning of sergei skripal a former russian agent convicted of spying for britain and his daughter yulia escalated wednesday when may announced the expulsion of russian diplomats and severed highlevel contacts with moscow may also vowed both open and covert action against russia which denies being behind the nerve agent attack the white house initially said trump agreed with may on the need for consequences following the attack but did not specify whether the us planned any punishment of its own nikki haley the us ambassador to the united nations said wednesday that russia must cooperate with the british investigation and account for its actions sanders statement wednesday evening went further the latest action by russia fits into a pattern of behavior in which russia disregards the international rulesbased order undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide and attempts to subvert and discredit western democratic institutions and processes the united states is working together with our allies and partners to ensure that this kind of abhorrent attack does not happen again some congressional lawmakers had nudged trump to bolster the us response including republican sen ben sasse of nebraska who said americans ought to be leading a conversation with our nato allies about a collective response to this act and future acts of aggression mays rapid response stands in stark contrast to mr trumps handling of russias interference in the presidential election which is now a centerpiece of special counsel robert muellers sprawling investigation trump has often muddied the conclusion of us intelligence agencies declaring that while russia interfered others likely did as well and hes irritated russia hawks in congress including numerous republicans by declining to use a new law letting the us slap sanctions on foreign companies or governments that do business with russias defense or intelligence sectors those powers took effect in january but so far nobody has been punished this latest russian provocation against a close us partner comes at a particularly delicate moment for the trump administration with both allies and adversaries closely watching us foreign policy after tillersons ouster though tillerson faced initial skepticism about his posture toward russia given his business relationships with the kremlin the former head of exxonmobil emerged as a leading russia critic in the trump cabinet he repeatedly took moscow to task for its actions in ukraine syria and elsewhere rex tillerson was the person that donald trump was relying on for russia policy said andrew weiss who held national security positions during the bill clinton and george hw bush administrations and now serves as vice president for studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace thats all now up for grabs mr trump has tapped cia director mike pompeo to replace tillerson at the state department the former republican congressman has accepted the intelligence agencies conclusion that russia interfered in the election but has downplayed the notion that the meddling was an effort to help mr trump get elected the russians attempted to interfere in the united states election in they also did so before that pompeo told fox news sunday theres a long history of russian efforts to influence the united states and conduct influence operations against the united states pompeo also raised eyebrows earlier this year by meeting senior russian security officials in washington days before the trump administration declined to impose new sanctions on moscow over the election interference pompeo described the meetings as normal contacts for the heads of espionage services if pompeo is confirmed by the senate the us relationship with russia will be among the most vexing issues he has to tackle tillerson lamented the state of affairs with moscow on one of his final days as americas top diplomat unaware he was about to hand off the problem to a new secretary of state ive become extremely concerned about russia he said we spent most of last year investing a lot into attempts to work together to solve problems to address differences and quite frankly after a year we didnt get very far instead what weve seen is a pivot on their part to be more

nato and beyond the bombing campaign in syria over the weekend has sharpened the confrontation and things could get even worse with further sanctions being discussed as we write the un secretary general antónio guterres is talking about the cold war being back with a vengeance yet the situation today is very different and in some respects even more dangerous after the cuban missile crisis in both sides knew and largely accepted the red lines of the other that is not the case today rather a return to cold war mentalities and habits of confrontation is taking place without clear rules of the road new cyber capabilities emerging space weapons and prompt conventional strike systems are offering unprecedented opportunities for aggressive behaviour unfettered by rules developed in another age international agreements that were painstakingly agreed in better times for example limiting nuclear armaments are now under threat mutual isolation is not an option we are simply too dependent on each other in economic and security terms russia needs access to foreign markets for its exports and for the technologies needed to fuel its future economic development the uk for its part has benefited from russian investments and from the contribution to its society made by many resident russians british and russians fought shoulder to shoulder in the two great wars of the last century even if these interdependencies were now to fray and the history of our brotherhood in arms was nearly forgotten the reality of the nuclear age is that neither of our countries can be safe unless both are safe for all the publicity given to new weapons systems the fundamental technical reality of mutually assured destruction mad has not changed for the past half century between russia and the us but also between russia and the uk the odds are that it will not change in any foreseeable future over the past two years our institutes the russian international affairs council and the royal united services institute have been organising a dialogue for nongovernmental experts on security issues designed to discuss ways in which the relationship between our two countries can be better managed while the new realities created by the skripal case have inevitably rendered some of our recommendations impossible to carry out in the immediate term their underlying logic remains in the difficult period that now lies ahead it will be vital to keep channels of communication open further crises are almost certain to occur but each crisis like each unhappy family will be unhappy in its own way and will bring its own dangers and perhaps in some cases opportunities maintaining routes through which countries can talk frankly with each other both at a political and operational level is most important when their relations are at their worst reliable communication channels between the military forces of russia and nato have also become more vital now that they are facing off against each other more frequently the hotline between the us and russia in syria is a good example in this regard and is going to become even more relevant if the conflict in syria continues to escalate the uk and russia recently agreed to renew and improve their incidents at sea agreement and this might be used as a model for new incidents in the air agreements to reduce the risks of dangerous manoeuvres leading to major accidents as the scale and incidence of major military exercises increases more needs to be done to provide assurance that these could not be used as cover for more aggressive activity relations between russia and the uk have taken a hard knock from recent events it will not be easy to repair the damage one of the casualties of the worsening of relations between our countries could be the further weakening of the major arms control agreements reached at the end of the cold war in relation to both nuclear and chemical weapons the collapse of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty agreed by presidents gorbachev and reagan in is now a growing risk if that happened it would not only be profoundly damaging in its own right it would also make it more difficult to renew the new start strategic arms reduction treaty on longrange arms now the main cornerstone of bilateral nuclear arms control the treaty was signed by presidents obama and medvedev in at a time when reset appeared for a time to be working recent events both in salisbury and in syria also show the urgent attention that needs to be given to restoring the credibility of the chemical weapons convention beyond these specific agreements both of our countries face a range of common threats from international terrorism growing instability in afghanistan and powerful criminal networks working together on these will serve our common interest in countering these problems and provide security for our peoples relations between russia and the uk have taken a hard knock from recent events it is not going to be easy to repair the damage that has been done yet it is precisely in these circumstances that frank and honest dialogue is more important than ever

and a british police officer were poisoned with a rare and powerful nerve agent skripal and his daughter remained in critical condition as of thursday and the police officer was considered seriously ill russia insists it had no motive to target skripal with what britain says was the first such attack in europe since world war ii advertisement skripal had taken his daughter who was on a visit from moscow out for lunch before they both collapsed on a bench many russians remain skeptical that the state was responsible and some analysts have not ruled out the involvement of ordinary criminals or rogue agents on thursday deputy foreign minister sergei ryabko denied that russia even had a program to develop the novichok nerve agent i want to state with all possible certainty that the soviet union or russia had no programs to develop a toxic agent called novichok he told interfax news agency he slammed people distributing information that the program allegedly existed an apparent reference to soviet chemist vil mirzayanov who first revealed the existence of that class of ultrapowerful nerve agents mirzayanov who now lives in the united states says moscow invented the highly toxic nerve agent during the cold war and used to produce it in a moscowbased institute where he worked until the early s we ended all research in the sphere of new military toxic agents after joining the chemical weapons convention and last year all stockpiles of toxic agents were destroyed said ryabkov he said the united states has failed to do the same advertisement i hope that debates around the tragedy in salisbury will not be a new pretext for the us to depart from what they have to do within the framework of their own obligations he added in a rare joint statement us president donald trump french president emmanuel macron german chancellor angela merkel and british prime minister theresa may said there is no plausible alternative explanation to russian responsibility the leaders said the use of a chemical weapon is an assault on uk sovereignty and a breach of international law on wednesday may expelled russian diplomats from the uk severed highlevel contacts with moscow and vowed both open and covert actions following the attack plunging ukrussia relations to a level not seen since the cold war russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said thursday that moscow would

response to the crisis is that russia should go away and shut up there is of course more than boriss cunning deductions from kremlin sarcasm and williamsons marching order to vladimir putin surely one of the most unintentionally comic turns in modern political times behind theresa mays assertion that moscow has carried out an attack with a nerve agent for the first time in europe since the second world war by this afternoon the foreign secretary was holding that it was overwhelmingly likely that the russian president had personally ordered the attempted murder the british government came to the conclusion of kremlin culpability very early after the poisoning of former mi agent sergei skripal and his daughter yulia on march there had been criticism of the slowness of the police investigation into the attack on alexander litvinenko who was contaminated with polonium also allegedly by the russians and on this occasion the inquiry has moved at remarkable pace there has been scepticism about the intelligence services with much publicity in the case of seumas milne jeremy corbyns spokesman who likened its conclusions about russian collusion to the false claims about saddam husseins weapons of mass destruction used to justify the invasion of iraq obviously the government has access to information and intelligence on this matter which others dont said milne however also theres a history in relation to weapons of mass destruction and intelligence which is problematic to put it mildly there are points of issue here the same intelligence assessment on which the government and the national security council made their decision to blame russia was shown to corbyn as a privy councillor we are told by whitehall officials he presumably was not convinced by what he saw secondly there is an obvious difference between the alleged wmd in iraq and the salisbury attack wmd did not exist in iraq at the time of the invasion whereas we know that a nerve agent was used on the skripals unless milne holds that was concocted intelligence was manipulated sexed up on iraq to provide george w bush and tony blair the justification for a war they had already decided on waging it is unclear who exactly wants to restart the cold war in the west it is hardly likely to be donald trump under investigation for being the alleged muscovite candidate in the us election theres no clear reason why germany france or the uk would want to do so either there is however a common factor between what happened in iraq and the current crisis a tendency to attack those who question the official version of events with accusations of being unpatriotic a traitor even something jeremy corbyn is facing the leader of the opposition may well have misjudged the mood of the house on wednesday but the questions he raised had validity it is impossible to judge the intelligence performance on the salisbury attack at this time because we simply do not know the details of why the services are convinced that the russian state was behind the attack there was more scope to examine the iraq intelligence even before the extent of the secrets and lies came out in the various public inquiries which followed i was among a small number of journalists in iraq before the invasion accompanying the un teams searching for the supposed arsenal of chemical biological and nuclear weapons on visits back to england and the us it was apparent that the inspections meant to be the key to resolving the crisis were just a sideshow while paying lip service to the un the bush and blair administrations were preparing for war in september a few colleagues and i downloaded from the internet at the al rashid hotel in baghdad the downing street dossier on the imminent threat posed by iraqs wmd we had arranged with tariq aziz iraqs deputy prime minister and saddam confidant to visit some of the sites named in the dossier as producing chemical and biological weapons we chose the sites alqaqa a military complex miles from baghdad and the amariyah sera vaccine plant at abu ghraib and were taken there by the iraqi authorities within two hours of the dossier being produced we were allowed to go anywhere we wanted at the sites and to take soil samples but we were scrupulously careful in the stories we filed to stress that we were not scientists or weapons experts and so could not make judgments about the facilities we had visited the reaction of the downing street spin doctors was ludicrously overthetop the accusations against us ranged from being naive dupes to propagandists for the saddam regime after liberation the two sites we had been to and every other named in the dossier were inspected by un teams and the iraq survey group set by the us and uk no wmd of course were found details of what led the intelligence services to conclude that the kremlin carried out the salisbury attack will emerge no doubt over time the reason why it is surprising has been

to return to her homeland one day despite the kremlin being blamed for the attack reuters the former russian military intelligence colonel had been in prison in russia for more than a dozen years he could have been bumped off any time if they really wanted to take retribution on traitors skripal had come to britain in a spyswap and was no longer active the fact that he lived under his own name and had not been given a false identity was clear indication that he was not deemed to be in danger there has also been a wide range of theories some masquerading as facts in the media about what supposedly happened that skripal was working on the trump dossier that his daughter was the real target of the attack because of her love life that the nerve agent had been administered through the door handle of his car or in his food or that it had been slipped in through a present his daughter had brought from moscow there was also a claim that he remained a mi agent and had been meeting his handler in salisbury the two men did not bother with things like security precautions it seems but met in the same restaurant every month and spoke loudly in russian waitress dagmara wieczorak told a tabloid that she was sure that she was shown a picture of an englishman in a tweed suit that used to meet sergei every month asked about this a security official responded tiredly yes being mi not only was he wearing a tweed suit but he also carried a pipe wore a carnation and they greeted each other with the code it gets very cold in vladivostok but real facts are sparse on the ground a crime as elaborately planned as this surely needs a motive so what was it if russia lost control of the nerve agent the alternative charge by theresa may to the attempted assassination when could this have happened why did the director general of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ocpw categorically state last november that all chemical weapons in russias stockpile have been destroyed the kremlin may well be responsible for the salisbury attack as mays government insists but questions need to be asked including by politicians and answers should be provided rather than hysterical accusations of treachery

responsible for the attack and that there is no plausible alternative explanation the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the us the uk itself as well as the high representative of the european union declared in a joint statement issued in the wake of their meeting in toronto on monday they doubled down on the allegations voiced by london that former spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were poisoned with a militarygrade nerve agent of a type developed by russia accusing it of running a novichok program that it allegedly failed to declare in breach of the chemical weapons convention cwc russia has refuted all the accusations insisting that it had destroyed its last chemical weapons in while the us was long overdue repeatedly missing its deadline to reciprocate in the latest prank by the famous russian duo vovan and lexus a man they claimed was organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons directorgeneral ahmet uzumcu admitted that the supposed novichok could have essentially been produced by any country including the us russia became one of the stars of the lengthy g communique getting chastised in connection with the civil conflict in ukraine crimeas reunification and what the west sees as moscows efforts to disrupt established democracies with its meddling on the topic of crimea which reunited with russia in following a popular referendum they blamed moscow for alleged violations and abuses committed against its population by russia claiming that since russia took over the reins in the peninsula the human rights situation there has degraded meanwhile support for the decision among russians has been overwhelming and has remained steady for years according to a march poll by the levada center percent stand behind the move roughly the same number as four years ago seventy percent believe that russias reunification with crimea was beneficial to the country representatives of g also said russia was responsible for the lingering conflict in eastern ukraine that was sparked by a bloody coup that ousted the government of viktor yanukovich and polarized the country to the point of an allout civil war hinting at the possibility of new punitive action against moscow the ministers stated that economic sanctions against russia could be rolled back only if russia fulfills its commitments under the minsk agreements but we also stand ready to take further restrictive measures should russias actions so require the statement read without elaborating the eu and the us have slapped russia with several rounds of sanctions the last one imposed by washington in early april targeting highprofile businessmen as well as companies the us said moscow was being punished for a range of malign activity around the globe namely its reunification with crimea involvement in the ukrainian conflict and support for the government of syria in line with the blame russia narrative the ministers went on to reiterate allegations of moscows interference in countries democratic systems calling russias behavior irresponsible and destabilizing they urged moscow to live up to its international obligations as a united nations security council member however they noted that there are still areas where g countries and russia need to work together notwithstanding we will continue to engage with russia on addressing regional crises and global challenges we will continue to bolster our capabilities to address hybrid threats including in the areas of cybersecurity strategic communications and counterintelligence the communique reads as far as the usled missile strikes on syria are concerned the statement completely mirrors the justification of the military action provided by the trio of western allies at the time of the attack laying the blame for the alleged chemical incident in douma on april on the syrian government the g foreign ministers argue that what the us uk and france did was to alleviate the extreme suffering of the syrian people with a limited proportionate and necessary response the move they claim was taken only after exhausting every possible diplomatic option to uphold the international norm against chemical weapons use again they lambasted russia for vetoing the ussponsored resolution that would have resurrected the joint investigative mechanism jim into chemical incidents on syrias soil the jim whose mandate expired last year was criticized by moscow as inherently flawed since its investigators issued a damning report based on unverified witness accounts and thirdparty analysis without ever going to the site of the incident in khan shaykhun just over a year ago the discrepancies in the report and lack of integrity of the investigation were repeatedly pointed out by russia which called it simply amateurish and logically inconsistent

may has already received strong support from key european leaders and the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw the body responsible for the control of chemical weapons the package of measures may is contemplating came in the face of a warning by maria zakharova the russian foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman that britain must not try to scare moscow pointing to vladimir putins recent speech in which he presented a range of new nuclear weapons the russian embassy in london made clear that it would not comply with a british demand that it meet a deadline of midnight on tuesday to set out its knowledge of the states role in the poisoning of skripal and his daughter yulia instead russia demanded access to the samples of the nerve agent novichok allegedly used in the attack and claimed mays ultimatum to moscow breached international protocols which allow an accused nation days to respond russias ambassador to the opcw alexander shulgin accused the uk of making unfounded accusations and pumping out hysteria we call upon them to abandon the language of ultimatums and threats and return to the legal field of the chemical convention which allows us to resolve this kind of situation he said a spokesman for the russian embassy in the uk responding to speculation britain may mount a cyberstrike as part of its response said statements by a number of mps whitehall sources and experts regarding a possible deployment of offensive cybercapabilities cause serious concern not only is russia groundlessly and provocatively accused of the salisbury incident but apparently plans are being developed in the uk to strike russia with cyberweapons in moscow the russian foreign ministry summoned the british ambassador laurie bristow and warned that actions by the british authorities are openly provocative any threats of sanction measures against russia will not be left without a response the ministry said russia said there would be reprisals for any move to close the ukbased russia today news channel a measure that may might ask the broadcasting regulator ofcom to consider as one of her measures not a single british media outlet will work in our

while running near his home in surrey traces of a chemical that can be found in the poisonous plant gelsemium were later found in his stomach before his death perepilichnyy was helping a specialist investment firm uncover a m russian moneylaundering operation a preinquest hearing was told hermitage capital management claimed that perepilichnyy could have been deliberately killed for helping it uncover the scam involving russian officials he may have eaten a popular russian dish containing the herb sorrel on the day of his death which could have been poisoned march boris berezovsky the exiled billionaire was found hanged in an apparent suicide after he had spent more than decade waging a highprofile media battle against his onetime protege putin a coroner recorded an open verdict

found march skripal poisoning sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were were found unconscious on a bench in the maltings shopping centre in salisbury after suspected exposure to an unknown substance which was later identified as chemical weapon novichok in the aftermath theresa may blamed vladimir putin and expelled russian diplomats who were suspected of spying two russian men using the identities ruslan boshirov and alexander petrov were named as suspects they appeared on russian tv to protest their innocence the skripals survived however a local woman dawn sturgess died after spraying novichok on her wrists from a fake nina ricci perfume bottle converted into a dispenser which had been recovered from a skip by her partner charlie rowley was this helpful thank you for your feedback throughout the day the uk worked hard diplomatically in washington to persuade trump to set aside his desire for a rapport with putin and recognise that russia was the only country that had the means or the motive to seek to kill skripal in his first response and before his scheduled phone call with may trump offered only a reluctant acceptance of the british case but did not directly ascribe responsibility to russia it sounds to me like they believe it was russia and i would certainly take that finding as fact he said as soon as we get the facts straight and we are going to be speaking with the british today were speaking with theresa may today and as soon as we get the facts straight if we agree with them we will condemn russia or whoever it may be later no said that during their phone call trump told may that the us was with the uk all the way it is not clear if the uk has definitive evidence that a russian government agent was responsible for deploying the poison it would be a blow to anglous relations if trump refused to accept the british intelligence assessment but since his election he has felt under siege over allegations that he colluded with russia to win the presidency and he believes former british intelligence officers have been feeding those allegations in another potential blow to the uk trump dismissed his secretary of state only hours after rex tillerson unaware that his sacking was imminent issued an unequivocal defence of the uk position which contrasted with a more ambivalent white house statement issued on monday eu leaders rallied to the uk cause with the eu parliaments chief brexit negotiator guy de verhofstadt calling for a common eu stance at next weeks council of ministers mrs may has said this is an attack against britain as a country and i think that a common reaction in the next european council is absolutely needed and countermeasures should be decided by the eu he said but privately eu officials admit that european unity on sanctions against russia over ukraine has been cracking and the latest episode will only ensure the current range of sanctions remain the german chancellor angela merkel has been keen to use the expected reelection of putin this weekend as an occasion to reopen talks on the ukraine peace process similarly the french president emmanuel macron does not want to close dialogue with putin after a round of international calls drumming up support among key allies the foreign secretary boris johnson said if this was a direct act by the russian state then it would not simply be a threat to the uk but a clear violation of the chemical weapons convention a breach of international law and a threat to those who abide by the rulesbased international order as a whole
https://www.rt.com/uk/421542-theory-poison-sailsbury-skripal/,527,35,prime minister theresa may has pointed the finger at moscow for the poisoning of sergei skripal and his daughter yulia in salisbury but who was the person that actually attacked them these are the three top theories so far at this point police have not made any arrests and they do not appear to have any concrete leads the assailant or assailants have seemingly slipped away unnoticed leaving plenty of room for theories about what actually happened on that day in salisbury was it in yulia skripals suitcase some papers are speculating that the nerve agent that poisoned the skripals was planted in yulias suitcase before she left moscow senior sources reportedly told the telegraph that they are convinced the nerve agent was hidden in yulias luggage perhaps hidden in an item of clothing cosmetics or in a gift that was opened in skripals house in salisbury was it sprayed on them by a mystery woman another theory being explored is that the novichok was contained in an aerosol can and sprayed in the faces of the exrussian spy and his daughter according to the daily mail former russian double agent sergei skripal may have been ambushed by attackers who sprayed him with poison in the street cctv footage has been shared by the media that shows a blonde woman in the area at the same time the skripals were poisoned but authorities have not confirmed that they are searching for the mystery woman it was another spy from the russian government the poisoning may have been a message to other russian operatives according to shaun walker from the guardian walkers theory questions whether the alleged assassination attempt was a deterrent a warning to other operatives about the consequences of colluding with the enemy the demonstrative killing of a traitor could be a warning to junior officers not to follow the same path walker said in his article russian officials have often made it clear that traitors will meet a sticky end one way or another stolen novichok another theory purports that the novichok may have been stolen the soviet unions chemical weapons program was in such disarray following the cold war that some toxic substances and knowhow may have fallen into the hands of criminals according to people who dealt with the chemical program at the time biological and chemical weapons expert amy smithson spoke to reuters about the possibility could somebody have smuggled something out she said i certainly wouldnt rule that possibility out especially a small amount and particularly in view of how lax the security was at russian chemical facilities in the early s while this theory does not point the finger at any suspects it does open the case to a new realm of possibilities think your friends would be interested share this story

his daughter yulia in salisbury the ministry of foreign affairs announced the expulsion of us diplomats and the closure of the us consulate in st petersburg yesterday today it said dozens of european diplomats would be joining them with titfortat marching orders there were also new measures taken against the uk the ringleader of the coordinated international response the british embassy would be given a month to reduce staff to parity with russian diplomatic staff in the uk a statement read the additional british measures were a response to the provocative and unjustified actions leading to the unjustified expulsion of russian diplomats from a number of states britain contends that the kremlin orchestrated a chemical attack on former spy sergei skripal in salisbury using a substance from the family of novichok nerve agents first developed in the soviet union in the s it has based these claims on the basis of what it describes as capability intent and motive earlier this month prime minister theresa may issued an ultimatum to moscow accept it either ordered the attack or had lost control of undeclared chemical weapons stocks last week a story in the independent novaya gazeta newspaper suggested the latter scenario was not implausible the article documented the illegal sale of novichok agents to organised crime groups and their role in the murder of banker ivan kivelidi it also suggested the agents would remain toxic for decades the revelations raised the possibility of nonstate or nearstate actors being involved in an operation but the kremlin has not rushed to embrace such a theory instead it has responded angrily to what it describes as a baseless antirussian campaign and offered a number of alternative often barely credible explanations they have blamed the uk ukraine the czechs kremlin critic bill browder the portland down weapons research facility and poisoned pizzas said ian bond a former british diplomat in moscow they have not suggested they lost

so far the british response has been a model exercise in coalition building said mr bond the kremlin will not have anticipated the participation of traditionally reluctant allies such as italy the response of the trump administration to expel diplomats on monday was seen as particularly insulting in moscow while the us president has toned down prorussia rhetoric recently the kremlin had entertained hopes of improving relations russian ambassador on us expulsion of diplomats the us is ruining what little remains of relations between the countries konstantin kosachev chair of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said that the american response had gone beyond cold war hostilities between two superpowers writing on facebook he described the new confrontation as a fight without rules the us was behaving as a bully complaining about getting a taste of its own medicine he added uk ambassador laurie bristow told the ria news agency that britain would study the latest russian response and take action accordingly at home there are growing demands for greater action against russian money and influence home secretary amber rudd signalled a review of investorgrade visas issued to russians before rules were tightened in downing street has also briefed about the possibility of moving against the sale of russian sovereign debt in london but there are questions as to whether such a move would be possible without broader international agreement it would also be viewed as a highly provocative gesture in moscow with unpredictable consequences sergei karaganov a political analyst considered close to the kremlin told the independent that russia would use any instrument to defend its sovereignty russians had come to view the british as bad sports and the west with disdain he said this followed from absurd allegations that the kremlin had poisoned a nonentity mr skripal russia was in the process of challenging the longterm hegemony of europe and this was not an easy process there will be a new world order in years i hope said mr karaganov for now we are grappling with an indecent rearguard action led by groups who are losing

that we committed a crime in other words confess he said according to the bbc we do not speak the language of ultimatums we do not use that language with anyone and we will not allow to be spoken to in that language either he added we demand that material proof be provided of the allegedly found russian trace in this highresonance event without this stating that there is incontrovertible truth is

skripal in comments tweeted by the russian mission at the un mr nebenzya said the uk was dragging the case to the un security council ignoring its international commitments because the opcw will not be convinced by its arguments it said incredible things are happening behind our eyes the process of replacing the presumption of innocence with the presumption of guilt is taking place moreover this criminal law principle is transferred into international relations the authorities of uk are not interested in finding the truth about the skripal case they have other motives they are using

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/russia-highly-likely-to-be-behind-poisoning-of-spy-says-theresa-may,563,437,theresa may has given vladimir putins administration until midnight on tuesday to explain how a former spy was poisoned in salisbury otherwise she will conclude it was an unlawful use of force by the russian state against the uk after chairing a meeting of the national security council the prime minister told mps that it was highly likely that russia was responsible for the attack on sergei skripal and his daughter yulia she warned that britain would not tolerate such a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil in a statement to the house of commons that triggered an angry response from moscow the prime minister said the evidence had shown that skripal had been targeted by a militarygrade nerve agent of a type developed by russia describing the incident as an indiscriminate and reckless act she said that the foreign secretary boris johnson had summoned the russian ambassador to whitehall and demanded an explanation by the end of tuesday russian officials immediately hit back with maria zakharova the spokeswoman for the russian foreign minister calling the remarks a provocation and describing the event as a circus show in the british parliament andrei lugovoi a russian member of parliament who stands accused of the murder of the former russian agent alexander litvinenko said mays decision to point the finger at moscow so quickly was at a minimum irresponsible quick guide what is novichok show novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the soviet union in the s and s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons like other nerve agents they are organophosphate compounds but the chemicals used to make them and their final structures are considered classified in the uk the us and other countries the most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than vx the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents which include sarin tabun and soman novichok agents work in a similar way by massively overstimulating muscles and glands treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents namely with atropine diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes the chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in by vil mirzayanov a former russian scientist living in the us but the structures have never been publicly confirmed it is thought they can be made in different forms including as a dust aerosol the novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal after mixing two otherwise harmless components according to mirzayanov they are to times more toxic than conventional nerve agents photograph matt cardygetty images europe was this helpful thank you for your feedback ministers on the national security council were told that the nerve agent used was from a family of substances known as novichok based on the positive identification of this chemical agent by worldleading experts at porton down our knowledge that russia has previously produced this agent and would still be capable of doing so russias record of conducting statesponsored assassinations and our assessment that russia views some defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations the government has concluded that it is highly likely that russia was responsible for the act against sergei and yulia skripal she said the prime minister said that left just two plausible explanations either this was a direct act by the russian state against our country or the russian government lost control of this potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others may made clear that she believed there was already a backdrop of a wellestablished pattern of russian state aggression listing the illegal annexation of crimea violating european airspace and a sustained campaign of cyberespionage and disruption including meddling in elections and hacking the danish ministry of defence and the bundestag among many others she also spoke of the extrajudicial killing of terrorists and dissidents outside russia and the murder of litvinenko the home secretary amber rudd will chair a meeting of the governments cobra emergency committee in whitehall at am on tuesday to discuss the latest developments in the investigation may said the government would consider russias response on wednesday should there be no credible response we will conclude that this action amounts to an unlawful use of force by the russian state against the united kingdom she said promising to return to the house with a full range of retaliatory measures this attempted murder using a weaponsgrade nerve agent in a british town was not just a crime against the skripals it was an indiscriminate and reckless act against the united kingdom putting the lives of innocent civilians at risk and we will not tolerate such a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil the tough statement means that a major diplomatic row is looming between moscow and london with expulsions on both sides highly likely russias hardline ambassador to the uk alexander yakovenko may well be sent home the labour leader jeremy corbyn responded by saying the whole house condemned the deeply alarming attack and that a full account was needed from russian authorities however he warned against a full breakdown of communications with moscow we need to continue seeking a robust dialogue with russia on all the issues currently dividing our countries rather than simply cutting off contact and letting the tensions and divisions get worse and potentially even more dangerous he said corbyn then began a political attack on the conservatives after reports that the party had accepted donations of more than from russian oligarchs since may took over the leadership he asked why the government had not accepted a labourled amendment to the sanctions and antimoney laundering bill that would pave the way for socalled magnitsky powers to punish human rights abuses with asset freezes and visa bans andrei lugovoi said mays decision to point the finger at moscow was at a minimum irresponsible photograph misha japaridzeap may responded that her governments simple approach to moscow was engage but beware referring to her previous comments on on russian interference in elections she said there can be no question of business as usual with russia on the magnitsky powers she insisted that the uk was already able to take tough action against individuals but did promise to try to reach agreement over the amendment in gordon brown kicked out four russian diplomats in protest at vladimir putins refusal to extradite lugovoi and dmitry kovtun the two assassins who put polonium into alexander litvinenkos tea the russian foreign ministry expelled four british diplomats in response on this occasion putin is likely to react badly to mays ultimatum the uks ambassador to moscow laurie bristow the deputy ambassador at the time of litvinenkos murder is vulnerable additionally the kremlin may take action against the bbc when relations plummeted over litvinenko moscow closed the st petersburg office of the british council and accused its director stephen kinnock now a labour mp of drinkdriving the use of novichok a deadly nerve agent developed in the s and s by the soviet union will be seen as a brutal calling card it was inevitable that the poison would be discovered with a trail leading straight back to moscow the attack came two weeks before russias presidential election on sunday the calculation may be that the skripal case galvanises putins conservative base and boosts votes the reaction of backbench mps to mays statement was largely supportive on all sides of the house the tory chair of the foreign affairs select committee tom tugendhat said the salisbury attack was if not an act of war certainly a warlike act by the russian federation labours yvette cooper who chairs the home affairs committee said it was hard to see any alternative to the prime ministers very grave conclusion but asked if any action had been taken to review other cases that she had raised a number of backbench mps criticised corbyn for failing to speak out more strongly in the face of what they described as a national security threat iain duncan smith the former tory leader said the prime minister had risen to the occasion but that colleagues would be disappointed by the labour leaders partisan attack his conservative colleague johnny mercer described the opposition response as a shameful moment others argued that the time for dialogue with moscow had run out in a barbed attack on corbyn the labour mp john woodcock a longtime critic of his party leader welcomed the resilience of may and said the uk would face a national security threat if led by anyone who did not understand the gravity of the threat which russia poses the ministry of defence mod is planning to accelerate and expand its cyberoffensive capability over the next five years in response to the present crisis with russia according to whitehall sources the aim is to increase the uks ability to strike back against selected targets in russia and other states regarded as hostile such as china north korea and iran the mod is also in the wake of salisbury planning to spend more on chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn defence the move is an acknowledgement that it has paid inadequate attention to the increased danger may won strong support for her position from international allies the us secretary of state rex tillerson said whoever had ordered the attack must face serious consequences he said we have full confidence in the uks investigation and its assessment that russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack that took place in salisbury last week there is never a justification for this type of attack the attempted murder of a private citizen on the soil of a sovereign nation and we are outraged that russia appears to have again engaged in such behaviour we agree that those responsible both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it must face appropriately serious consequences natos secretary general jens stoltenberg said the united kingdom has concluded that sergei skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a militarygrade nerve agent of a type developed by russia and prime minister theresa may stated today that it is highly likely that russia was responsible for the act the use of any nerve agent is horrendous and completely unacceptable the uk is a highly valued ally and this incident is of great concern to nato

security adviser sir mark sedwill revealed that they were the subject of interest from the kremlins security services since he said email accounts belonging to ms skripal had been targeted by cyber specialists with russias gru intelligence agency where her father was a colonel while passing secrets to britain as a double agent sir mark said that even after being convicted of espionage and handed over in a highprofile spy swap mr skripal may still have been seen as a target it is highly likely that the russian intelligence services view at least some of its defectors as legitimate targets for assassination he added only russia has the technical means operational experience and the motive for the salisbury attack the full letter from sir mark to nato secretary general jens stoltenberg can be seen below thank you again for your invitation to me to brief the north atlantic council on march regarding the recent attack in salisbury i am pleased that we have been able to remain in close contact with you and nato allies following this attack and particularly grateful for the measures taken by you and many allies in response as you will be aware yesterday the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw published their report summarising the analysis of environmental and biomedical samples relating to the investigation into the attempted assassination of mr skripal and his daughter as signatories to the chemical weapons convention all nato allies have received the full report and several will take part in next wednesdays meeting of the opcw executive council which the uk has called the opcws analysis matches the defence science and technology laboratorys own confirming once again the findings of the united kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical of high purity that was used in salisbury opcw have always been clear that it was their role to identify what substance was used not who was responsible i would like to share with you and allies further information regarding our assessment that it is highly likely that the russian state was responsible for the salisbury attack only russia has the technical means operational experience and the motive first the technical means dstl scientific analysis found that sergey and yulia skripal were poisoned using a specific novichok nerve agent opcws analysis confirmed the findings of the united kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical this was found in environmental samples taken at the scene and in biomedical samples from both skripals and police sergeant nick bailey the first responder dstl established that the highest concentrations were found on the handle of mr skripals front door these are matters of fact but of course the dstl anal ysis does not identify the country or laboratory of origin of the agent used in this attack a combination of credible opensource reporting and intelligence shows that in the s the soviet union developed a new class of fourth generation nerve agents known as novichoks the key institute responsible for this work was a branch of the state institute for organic chemistry and technology at shikhany near volgograd the code word for the offensive chemical weapons programme of which novichoks were one part was foliant it is highly likely that novichoks were developed to prevent detection by the west and to circumvent international chemical weapons controls the russian state has previously produced novichoks and would still be capable of doing so russias chemical weapons programme continued after the collapse of the soviet union by when russia signed the chemical weapons convention cwc it is likely that some novichoks had passed acceptance testing allowing their use by the russian military russias cwc declaration failed to report any work on novichoks russia further developed some novichoks after ratifying the convention in the mids president putin was closely involved in the russian chemical weapons programme it is highly unlikely that any former soviet republic other than russia pursued an offensive chemical weapons programme after independence it is unlikely that novichoks could be made

statesponsored assassination the owen report from the uks public inquiry into the death of aleksandr litvinenko concluded in january that he was deliberately poisoned with polonium that there was a strong probability that the fsb directed the operation and that president putin probably approved it commenting on other suspected assassinations between sir robert owen wrote these cases suggest that in the years prior to mr litvinenkos death the russian state may have been involved in the assassination of mr putins critics and that the russian state may have sponsored attacks against its opponents using poisons since there have been numerous suspected russian statesponsored assassinations outside the former soviet union during the s russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents and to train personnel from special units in the use of these weapons this programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents including by application to door handles within the last decade russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks under the same programme third the motive sergei skripal was a former russian military intelligence gru officer convicted of espionage in it is highly likely that the russian intelligence services view at least some of its defectors as legitimate targets for assassination we have information indicating russian intelligence service interest in the skripals dating back at least as far as when email accounts belonging to yulia skripal were targeted by gru cyber specialists we therefore continue to judge that only russia has the technical means operational experience and motive for the attack on the skripals and that it is highly likely that the russian state was responsible there is no plausible alternative explanation i would of course be pleased to brief you or nato allies further regarding this attack i know that nato will remain seized of the need to confront the increasingly aggressive pattern of russia behaviour of which the attack in salisbury was an acute and recent example i am copying this letter to the delegations of all nato allies as well as the delegations of other eu member states to nato i will also send a copy to the office of the high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/yulia-skripal-russian-poisoned-ex-spy-daughter-released-from-british-hospital/,566,13,london yulia skripal one of two russians poisoned by nerve agent has been released from the hospital salisbury district hospital medical director dr christine blanshard said tuesday the yearold skripal was discharged and taken to a secure location on monday according to bbc news in a press conference tuesday blanshard said she hoped sergei skripal would be able to be discharged in due course the british government is likely to keep details about yulia skripals location secret given the sensitivity of the case she was in critical condition after the march nerve agent attack apparently aimed at her father former russian spy sergei skripal she had arrived on an easter visit from moscow the day before the attack he remains hospitalized but officials say he is improving rapidly britain has accused the russian government of masterminding the attack on the skripals who were found unconscious on a bench in the english city of salisbury march britain says they were poisoned by a military grade nerve agent that could only have been made in russia russia has denied the allegation which has led to the expulsion of diplomats on both sides britain has been backed by the united states and its european allies in blaming russia for the assault
http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-russia-spy-poison-20180328-story.html,568,441,the russian former spy and his daughter left critically ill in a nerve agent attack three weeks ago were probably poisoned at the front door of their home in southwestern england british police said wednesday it was the first time police have said where they thought sergei skripal and his daughter yulia might have been poisoned the highest concentration of nerve agent found so far was on the skripals front door in salisbury and detectives plan to focus their investigation in the surrounding area londons metropolitan police said in a statement advertisement at this point in our investigation we believe the skripals first came in contact with the nerve agent from their front door deputy assistant commissioner dean haydon said in the statement police have also searched a variety of sites around salisbury including a pub a restaurant and a cemetery britain has blamed russia for the attack triggering the expulsion of about russian diplomats from britain the us and their western allies russia has vowed to respond but a senior diplomat said wednesday there is no hurry to retaliate russia vehemently denies britains accusation that it was behind the march attack russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov told the ria novosti state news agency that moscow is thoughtfully and thoroughly considering its response separately he was quoted by the interfax news agency as saying the expulsions were directed by london and washington adding that other nations succumbed to their pressure he added that all options are on the table regarding russias response president vladimir putins spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters that russias response will suit the interests of russia president trump spoke with british prime minister theresa may about the coordinated effort by western allies to expel russian intelligence operatives the white house said the leaders agreed wednesday that dismantling russian spy rings is a priority to curtail russian clandestine activities and prevent future chemical weapons attacks on either countrys soil skripal was imprisoned in russia after he sold secrets to british intelligence he was released in a spy swap and moved to britain britain says the skripals were poisoned with a nerve agent developed in soviet times and that it must have come from russia russian officials complain that britain hasnt presented evidence to back up the accusation the russian foreign ministry said wednesday that british special services could have been behind the poisoning british officials have previously rejected such russian claims as nonsense

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/18/australian-foreign-minister-backs-chemical-weapons-inspections-for-russia,570,442,julie bishop has placed australia firmly in britains corner in the escalating row with russia over the nerve agent attack on a former russian spy on uk soil the british prime minister theresa may expelled russian diplomats among other measures after saying the russian state was to blame for the march poison attack on sergei skripal and his daughter yulia which has left both in a critical condition russia retaliated overnight expelling british diplomats the kremlin has denied any involvement in the attack bishop said australia would support the uk in any move to send weapons inspectors into russia to view its program given russias signature on the chemical weapons convention under the chemical weapons convention one state that suspects another state of having illegal chemical weapons can seek these inspections and britain certainly has the right to do that and they are aware that we would support them should they go down that path bishop told the abc this is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue one cannot have a permanent member of the security council or indeed any country anywhere any time deploying illegal chemical weapons and so clearly britain is within its rights to take action as it has done with expelling diplomats russia typically retaliates but i have been in constant communication with uk foreign secretary boris johnson and australia is most certainly considering what other options might be available may has spoken in uk parliament to condemn russia for the attack on monday i set out that mr skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a novichok a military grade nerve agent developed by russia she told mps in a statement last week based on this capability combined with their record of conducting state sponsored assassinations including against former intelligence officers whom they regard as legitimate targets the uk government concluded it was highly likely that russia was responsible for this reckless and despicable act and there were only two plausible explanations either this was a direct act by the russian state against our country or conceivably the russian government could have lost control of a militarygrade nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others on sunday bishop echoed mays language and said australia also believed russia was either behind the attack or had lost control of its chemical weapons program russia is a party to the chemical weapons convention and under that chemical weapons convention all chemical weapons should have been declared and it would appear that this nerve agent has not been declared she said quick guide how hard is it to make a nerve agent show nerve agents are not hard to make in principle but in practice it takes specialised facilities and training to mix the substances safely the raw materials themselves are inexpensive and generally not hard to obtain but the lethality of the agents means they tend to be manufactured in dedicated labs the main five nerve agents are tabun which is the easiest to make sarin soman gf and vx the latter was used to kill kim jongnam the halfbrother of the north korean leader kim jongun at kuala lumpur airport last year vx is particularly stable and can remain on clothing furniture and the ground for a long time without proper decontamination all pure nerve agents are colourless organophosphorus liquids which after they were discovered to be highly poisonous in the s became the dominant chemical weapons of the second world war once made the substances are easy to disperse highly toxic and have rapid effects most are absorbed swiftly through the skin or inhaled but they can also be added to food and drink the agents take their toll on the body by disrupting electrical signals throughout the nervous system and the effects are fast and dramatic victims find it increasingly hard to breathe their lungs produce more mucus which can make them cough and foam at the mouth they sweat their pupils constrict and their eyes run the effects on the digestive system trigger vomiting meanwhile the muscles convulse many of those affected will wet themselves and lose control of their bowels at high doses failure of the nerves and muscles of the respiratory system can kill before other symptoms have time to develop there are antidotes for nerve agents such as oxime and atropine which are particularly effective against vx and sarin but they should be given soon after exposure to be effective was this helpful thank you for your feedback in fact russias program developing this nerve agent has not been declared so there are obligations on russia to get rid of any chemical weapons and most certainly it should have declared what it was doing with this program there is no other explanation no other plausible explanation as to where this nerve agent came from either russia was behind the attempted assassination of it has lost control of this previously undisclosed stockpile of nerve agent russians are voting in the presidential election on sunday which is expected to return vladimir putin to power for a further six years

https://www.redstate.com/kiradavis/2018/04/25/real-reason-britain-wont-release-alfie-evans-italy/,573,444,in this april handout photo provided by alfies army official toddler alfie evans cuddles his mother kate james at alder hey hospital liverpool england alfies army official via ap in recent weeks many people across the globe have been moved and outraged by the story of little alfie evans whose life hung in the balance in a british hospital and whose fate was taken from the hands of his parents by the national health service nhs and the courts as of the time of this publication alfie was forcibly removed from his breathing devices but continues to breathe on his own the nhs and the courts would not even allow alfie to go home with his parents and when the nation of italy offered to fly him to a rome hospital for experimental treatment at their own expense the courts told alfies parents they would not be allowed to leave the country even after alfie surprised doctors with his will to live he was denied water for nearly six hours he continued to be denied nourishment with the denial of his exit from england altogether it was clear that the british courts and the nhs had no intention of letting alfie live but why though still morally squishy theres a valid argument to be made that when a nation votes for socialist healthcare they are agreeing to let the government treat their lives as algorithms when the bottom line is measured in dollars rather than lives the risk a society takes is illustrated in cases like alfies the nhs simply cannot afford the extremely expensive prospect of keeping alive a little boy who most likely will not live much longer due to an incurable condition alfies chances of any meaningful recovery were slim to none it isnt outside the boundaries of reason that the government tasked with his treatment would deem it simply not worth the effort expended its cruel but logicalthe inevitable result of a singlepayer system i may not agree with such reasoning but i can at least derive the path that such woeful decisions must take in a place like the uk what is not logical and nearly incomprehensible is the decision of the court not simply to deny alfie further treatment but then deny his right and the right of his parents to leave the country to seek treatment elsewhere even that decision might make a tiny bit of sense if it were to add to the nhs costs that would be a problem for that pesky algorithm however italy had already sent an airlift equipped to take the young child his transportation and hospital provisions were covered by donations and the state of italy in fact to move alfie out of the care of the nhs would only save them money and labor alfies parents would have one more shot at rescuing his life it seems like a winwin for everyone and still the courts have barred the family from leaving the country lets ponder that for just one moment great britain is a nation with a proud history of freedom and democracy most other nations around the world and britons themselves would describe it as a free country and yet here is a case where its free citizens are not allowed to leave its borders is this something that should happen in a free country would alfies parents be barred from taking a vacation would anyone in their right mind in that country find it acceptable or consistent with british values to deny any family the right to leave for a vacation or to visit a relative abroad why then is it allowable for this family to be virtual hostages in their land simply because their reason for travel is medical care rather than pleasure some years ago i watched a documentary on the design and building of the berlin wall between east germany and west germany it included extremely rare clips of interviews with the architects i was shocked to learn there was actually a deliberate design to that monstrosity i searched high and low for the film but was unable to locate it if any reader has any clue where to find it please do let me knowive been desperate to watch it again in one clip an aging former east german wall architect spoke briskly about the strategy of his designs although the interview was conducted during what must have been the last years of his life he still seemed deeply resentful that he was being asked to defend the walls erection even after the fall of the eastern bloc ill never forget what he said in that interview it made the hair stand up on my arms with great sincerity almost pleading with the interviewer he said we had to build the wall too many people were leaving for the west and you need people to make socialism work we had to build the wall to keep them in so they could see how great socialism was so they could see that it works as i cant find the clip youll just have to take my word for it or not the point is this man and his comrades felt that the only way to sell people on their socialist vision was to force them to live in it those leaving were just too stupid to understand that it was the best thing for them this is exactly the point in the ruling by the nhs and the courts to forbid their free citizens from leaving the country if they are allowed to flee the heartwrenching consequences of socialism then others will want to do the same how can a socialist system work without the cooperation of everyone and how can you force people to participate in that socialist system when they discover that system may kill them or their loved ones you build a wall great britain doesnt yet have a wall to keep its citizens in but the courts have built one with the law just as east germany could not tolerate the massive loss of defectors who were leaving with their training intellect and tax dollars great britains healthcare system cannot tolerate the defection of those who might find better healthcare somewhere else after all how would it look if alfie were allowed to leave england allowed to leave a free country even to write the words feels absurd and then found a successful treatment in another country it would be an abject embarrassment to a government that holds up their socialist healthcare as one of the wonders of the western world not only would they be forced to admit that their own doctors and bureaucrats were wrong for denying this baby lifesaving measures but they would then have to deal with hundreds maybe thousands of other citizens fleeing the bondage of nhs algorithms for a chance at swifter more modern healthcare for some bizarre reason a nation that boasts figures like winston churchill and margaret thatcher a tiny island nation that was once so powerful and broad it was said that the sun never set on the british empirefor some inexplicable reason that nation has chosen to hang its pride and joy on socialized medicine if you think i exaggerate just look up the opening ceremonies of the london olympics to release this child to the care of any other nation would be to admit failure and heartless bureaucrats who will never have to watch young alfie struggle for air or dehydrate to death have decided that their misplaced pride is more valuable than the lives of their citizens as a born canadian ive often heard friends and family condescendingly mock the united states for our dogged refusal to bow to socialized medicine they have the woefully illinformed idea that people without health insurance here dont receive care or expensive treatment at all id rather pay higher taxes for free healthcare than deal with americas health system they often say to anyone who echoes such sentiments let me point to poor sweet alfie evans and his helpless parents as to why most americans still abhor the idea of the government having the last say in whether or not you get the treatment you need to live ask anyone here and times out of theyll tell you theyd give their last dollar sell their last possession go into debt for the rest of their lives to save the life of someone they loved rather than sit helpless as their government sentences that person to death because it just isnt worth it its never worth ituntil its your child when government controls your healthcare they ultimately control what your life is worth to the people who love you ill take the system we have here in america over what canada or the uk shoves down the throats of its citizens every day of the week and twice on sunday given how many canadians seek surgeries and treatments south of their border every year i reckon they would too alfie evans may indeed have never really had a chance to survive his illness but if there were a chance one that would not cost the taxpayers of great britain shouldnt his parents be allowed to seek it out shouldnt they as citizens of a free country be allowed to leave its borders whenever they please and for whatever reason they please sadly alfie and little charlie gard before him is doomed to be the sacrificial lamb at the altars of pride and socialism you will never convince me that this is right in any way never because what this is this is nothing short of real actual genuine evil ed note thomas laduke shares kiras and my and your outrage he is appealing to the powers that be in britain for intervention on alfies behalf caleb

http://theconversation.com/russian-spy-attack-shows-international-law-on-chemical-weapons-is-not-fit-for-purpose-93315,585,455,the nerve agent novichok used to attack a former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter in salisbury is similar to substances such as soman or sarin used to produce chemical weapons international law bans chemical weapons through the chemical weapons convention which requires its state signatories to refrain from using producing and stockpiling them so with this ban in place how is it possible that someone could use a nerve agent to attack two people the convention defines chemical weapons as toxic chemical substances employed in an unlawful way contrary to the convention it aims to prohibit the use production and possession of chemical weapons and also requires the destruction of chemical weapons and their production facilities read more nerve agents what are they and how do they work toxic chemical substances are not prohibited per se it is their association with a forbidden purpose that makes them a chemical weapon subject to the regulations of the convention despite the fact that toxic chemicals could be used to make chemical weapons they are not subject to the same strict regulations as chemical weapons such as the prohibition of their use or transfer instead they are subject to verification measures and to limits on their production and storage an inherent paradox the convention perfectly mirrors the paradox behind chemical weapons these powerful weapons are made up of substances that are often easy to produce some such as chlorine contained in drugs as hydrochloric acid are even used in medicine agriculture or industry for instance toxic chemicals can be found during research for new pesticides this means that what makes the difference between a toxic chemical substance and a chemical weapon is the purpose behind its use this logic can also apply to more ordinary objects such as a knife or drug a person can use a knife to slice some bread while a doctor can administer a drug to treat a patient however if those items fall into the wrong hands they can be used to kill or seriously harm someone in light of the dual use of these items the law cannot completely ban knives and drugs what it can do is to establish precautions that minimise the risk of knives and drugs being used in an unlawful way the same logic applies to the use of toxic chemical substances according to theresa mays statement to mps on march the substance used in the salisbury attack novichok was a nerve agent similar to toxic substances that are already regulated by the convention on chemical weapons but it is not banned under it the prime minister said the substance belongs to a category of toxic chemical which she termed a militarygrade nerve agent of a type developed by russia yuri kochetkovepa getting round the law the rules of the convention regarding toxic chemical substances do not apply in this case due to the fact that there was nothing to regulate this just shows how important international cooperation and transparency among countries on this issue are international legal instruments on weapons cannot function without constant updates regarding chemical production and new technological developments the convention requires states to share the details about any production of chemicals with the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons the body in charge of the enforcement of the convention states must declare information including the type of chemical that will be produced and the quantity such a declaration should have been done before novichok was produced after the discovery of a new chemical the convention provides guidelines for updating its lists of chemicals along with a speedy procedure to amend the relevant section of the convention another issue concerns the military nature of the nerve agent used in salisbury toxic chemicals can be produced and used for lawful purposes according to the convention including for military defence and protection reasons its just the use of toxic chemicals as a method of warfare that is strictly prohibited if whoever produced novichok had followed the provisions of the convention and had disclosed details such as its name and the structural formula of the chemical the nerve agent used in salisbury would not actually have been banned it would simply have been subjected to the limitations and the verification procedures of the convention that apply to other toxic substances this is because the convention bans chemical weapons but does not prohibit the use of toxic chemical substances for peaceful or acceptable purposes it seems that whoever produced and used novichok to attack the skripals did not want to share information about this substance and the facilities able to produce it in disregard of international law good faith and transparency are essential for the functioning of the international law on chemical weapons both of which currently appear to be lacking

https://www.rt.com/news/421550-russia-skripal-highly-likely/,607,242,while the probe into the poisoning of exspy sergei skripal is still ongoing and no tangible results have been presented the west seems desperate to put all the blame on russia and the arguments have become increasingly notable it all started when the british prime minister theresa may said that it was highly likely that russia was responsible for the poisoning of skripal and his daughter yulia her statement which presented an assumption as some sort of proof of moscows alleged culpability in the highprofile case seems to have opened a pandoras box of increasingly bizarre arguments that the british officials as well as londons allies in the west came up with in an attempt to convince the world of russias guilt almost immediately washington decided to endorse its special partners in london by parroting their dubious argument and said that moscow is likely responsible us president donald trump then apparently decided to throw his weight behind these accusations also saying that it looks like no one other than russian president vladimir putin could have been behind the attack the idea that russia was likely behind the skripal poisoning appeared to be a tenacious argument in the wests whole line of reasoning and it was soon adopted by other european officials as well the leaders of france germany the us and the uk even issued a joint statement which reiterated that it was highly likely that russia was responsible for the attack german chancellor angela merkel also joined the chorus of western officials who are sure that russia was culpable in the skripal case she also apparently found the likelihood that russia was involved in the incident quite convincing the german chancellor went to extraordinary lengths and said that the chance the traces will lead to russia is highly likely twice in one day during her joint press conferences with the swedish prime minister stefan lofven and the french president emmanuel macron on friday however the west apparently grew weary of such flawless reasoning and decided to come up with even more farfetched arguments to blame moscow macron for example said russia must be responsible for poisoning the former double agent because there is no other plausible explanation others however turned out to be more inventive in their arguments the us envoy to the un nikki haley suggested that there is some link between russias involvement in the salisbury case and its alleged failure to ensure that the syrian government destroys its chemical weapons she was never bothered by the fact that the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw a un watchdog and the pentagon confirmed that the syrian governments chemical weapons had actually been destroyed nato secretary general jens stoltenberg suddenly came to the conclusion that russias alleged role in the attack is somehow consistent with a general reckless pattern of russian behavior over many years he was not able to come up with anything better than the traditional accusations that have already been used against russia which included the military buildup from the north of europe to the middle east attempts to subvert democratic elections and institutions and what he called the annexation of crimea however what this had to do with the skripal case still remains a mystery british foreign secretary boris johnson apparently decided to deliver a knockout punch in the long line of striking arguments when he said that doing something like poisoning a former spy is just an indispensable part of russian nature according to the top british diplomat moscows response to londons rebukes only further proves its guilt there is something in the kind of smug sarcastic response that weve heard that indicates their fundamental guilt johnson told the bbc in an opinion piece he wrote for the washington post johnson also said that the entire incident was nothing other than the manifestation of blatant russianess predictably the foreign secretary also snatched at the opportunity to say that it is overwhelmingly likelythat putin directly ordered the poisoning it is no wonder that former german foreign minister sigmar gabriel eventually compared the whole situation to a lousy james bond movie he criticized politicians for expressing their most bizarre suspicions and pursuing their own conspiracy theories he also advised the officials to draw their conclusions after the end of the investigation and not before russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the incident speaking at a news briefing thursday russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova accused london of making insane accusations while refusing to provide moscow with any evidence earlier she also called the hearing at the british parliament where may said russia was highly likely responsible for the incident a circus show skripal and his yearold daughter have been in critical condition since march when they were found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping center in salisbury the man worked as a double agent for the uk intelligence agency mi and was jailed in russia in for spying for britain he was later part of a spy swap in which russia released four spies in exchange for russian agents if you like this story share it with a friend

murder attempt on moscow and the french germans and americans quickly pile on washington imposes still more sanctions on russia for its meddling and malicious cyberattacks during our election season this out of the blue its fair to say given that nothing new came to light last week treasury then accuses russia of hacking into the very heart of americas heart the power grid the nuclear generators the water systems manufacturing operations and asserts they have their fingers on the cyberlevers as we speak exhausting by the end of the week i thought of those earlys horror movies wherein the cameras linger on mobs of innocent citizens as they hold their hands up and their faces dissolve into a combination of fear and revulsion that is what we are supposed to feel do and look like it seems the russians they lurk above us poised to destroy all at any moment only truth justice and the american way as managed by patriots such as treasury secretary steve mnuchin a clark kent if ever i saw one can save us all that has transpired in recent days we have seen before of course the propagandists are vastly overdoing it in my view but i am always proven wrong on this point they slather it on with trowels but they still get the majority of people to go along the whole sorry mess still appears straightfaced and grave on page one of the new york times but i detected something different this past week maybe it is merely a matter of a lot of disinformation delivered all at once but it appears the west with washington in the lead is preparing to provoke a possibly fateful confrontation with russia the volume is getting very loud lets say this one does fear for there is one other thing that ought to be mentioned straightaway gazprom the russian natural gas producer shipper and marketer will soon cut staff at its european trading desks the hub of which is in london where it employs people by more than half reuters published the story wednesday as an exclusive and nearly no one took note this work is aimed at strengthening the companys position abroad a gazprom official explained what does this tell us gazprom cuts its trading staff in europe to strengthen its export business what could this mean i will return to these important questions these latest acute symptoms of russophobia began with another of those mysterious murders of mysterious russians living in england sergei skripal had been a russian intelligence agent but also a double agent working for mi russia tried and jailed him for treason in but he was released in an exchange of spooks four years later whereupon he withdrew to salisbury one of englands pleasanter cathedral towns skripal and his yearold daughter were found unconscious on a park bench on march apparently victims of a surreptitious attack with a deadly toxin that did not quite finish its work they remain hospitalized in critical condition british authorities began an investigation of course but proper investigations into russiarelated matters have not counted for years what ensued is a pattern that is remarkable for its flimsiness but also for its fidelity to itself and its effectiveness verbs are key and one must watch them carefully the conditional goes to the probable to the certain and then to the factual and no one is any longer waiting for the results of any investigation this process typically takes about two weeks as it has in the skripal case prime minister theresa may did her duty when she addressed the house of commons early last week she took the narrative of russian culpability to the highly likely stage and then refined this to the only plausible explanation phase she then announced that russian diplomats were to be expelled again without reference to an investigation that has scarcely begun neither has london indicated any intention of providing russia with samples of the nerve gas allegedly used as moscow had requested in its offer to cooperate this is how events are blurred in these cases assent from the americans and the continental allies followed late last week but there remained one step to take and boris johnson mays foppish foreign minister took care of it on friday our quarrel is with putins kremlin he said on the basis of nothing so far as one can tell we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the uk from a park bench in provincial england to putins desk twelve days start to finish the skripal case created a nearperfect occasion for the trump administrations announcement of a new set of sanctions these cover the people and three organizations that the mueller investigation indicted a few weeks ago so it is quite neat in that little or nothing apart from their value as perception management will come of either the indictments or the sanctions ditto the mnuchin account of cyberattacks on american infrastructure but there is more of this coming this was the disturbing message in the mnuchin presentation you will never see any evidence of anything we tell you but we are going to keep this up it is all ongoing he emphasized repeatedly how to think about these matters let me start with my theory of the skripal case i do not have one it is plausible that elements in russian intelligence acted with or without official approval against skripal the man lived on the dark side after all and his life and loyalties are an iceberg but it is a stretch in my view to accept that someone released eight years ago and since then retired in obscurity abroad was still the object of russias wrath one would require a clear explanation of motive and we have not been offered any shred of one senior russian officials asserted they had none we ought to note these things said i vigorously object to the catchphrase of the week russias culpability is the only plausible explanation skripal worked for mi as a double agent why is it not plausible that six is the responsible party here for reasons as illegible as any russia may have had and six knows very well how to make what it does look like someone else did it elementary tradecraft as i read events it was with mays only plausible assertion that her government overplayed its hand in my mind it raises the very possibility that may intended to keep far out of view by the past record we will never know what befell skripal and his daughter and why we can be more or less dead certain why the trump administration declared a new set of sanctions last week for no apparent cause trump and his inner circle of which mnuchin is a member now face mounting pressure to capitulate in the face of the neverending russiagate rubbish and trump made his strategy clear weeks ago he will go along with the orthodox narrative so long as he is spared charges of collusion this is the transaction we are now watching trump is spared impeachment proceedings and the democrats and muellerites chickenscratching for many months are spared embarrassment last week leaves us with three things to think about i have just suggested one trumps support for may in her attempt to cover up a mess of one or another kind along with the new sanctions are about trumps political predicament not the truth of events this is perfectly legible mnuchins bit is mere icing on the cake american politics has been reduced to spectacle for ages now foreign policy is too as of last week trump is confirmed as a captive of his own government in my view he has strings attached to his arms legs and jaw am i talking about the deep state well i do not at all mind the phrase but let us call it simply part c people actually running this country as to the brits and continentals last week was a depressing one the europeans have now fully reenlisted as the grunts in americas gettingtobedesperate campaign to maintain global primacy the greeks before syriza capitulated to the european union podemos in spain die linke in germany those years are by the boards now jeremy corbyns returnedtoroots labour party remains interesting but even if he is elected prime minister corbyn is not going to turn europe around he may turn out to be another bernie sanders not an appealing prospect one had hoped for much by way of a more independent europe but there is simply nothing there for now on friday tangentially related matter none other than britain france and germany proposed imposing their own new sanctions on iran to keep the trump administration in the nuclear agreement pitiful the final thing to think about is that gazprom announcement plans to restructure its export marketing away from europe were in place months before the skripal case and related events reuters reported and i do not want to read too much into this but i think it is a piece of a far larger phenomenon for centuries the west held many monopolies and high among them were markets and capital if you wanted to sell it or finance it you had to sell it to the advanced industrial nations or borrow from them they were the planets only game this is no longer so the nonwest china in many ways in the lead has voracious markets and plenty of investment capital now too the russians know this how do you cut staff in europe to grow your exports you bring staff home and face them east this last topic is vast i have written of it before in this space and shall do so again if i read gazproms plans correctly it is one tiny manifestation of russias gradual rotation from europe as its primary export market to what is traditionally called eurasia and the west which never seems to consider unintended consequences is doing all it can to hasten the turn

him london had one month to further cut its diplomatic contingent in russia to the same size as the russian mission in britain it also expelled diplomats from other countries for backing britain a spokeswoman for britains foreign office called the russian move regrettable and said it was considering the implications of the measures it did not say how many diplomatic staff in russia would be affected while the british embassy in moscow says it does not make staff numbers public russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova told reuters the demand meant britain would have to cut a little over more of its diplomatic and technical staff in russia on top of the diplomats who have already gone home we asked for parity the brits have diplomats more than the russians zakharova said on saturday asked if that meant london would now have to cut exactly diplomatic and technical staff she said a little over blatant provocation the russian foreign ministry later published a list of

sergei skripal was poisoned with novichok an extremely toxic russian nerve agent in salisbury england the militarygrade type of nerve agent suggests that the russian government was linked to the poisoning wp get the full experience choose your plan arrowright british prime minister theresa may asserts that the kremlin is highly likely to have been behind the poisoning if so russian president vladimir putin almost certainly sanctioned the attack directly but why would the kremlin commit such a dangerous crime right before russias presidential election while its relationships with western countries are collapsing several theories have emerged to explain moscows actions heres a summary of available theories which also involves my research on russian and soviet disinformation techniques advertisement did russian security services just get sloppy russian security may have used novichok in the past without being discovered skripal and his daughter were found unresponsive but alive on a park bench but novichok is an unusual chemical not something for which a morgue would ordinarily test had only skripal been targeted and had he received a higher dose he could be dead as if from a sudden heart attack or other natural causes such sloppiness would be consistent with the russian security services trend of declining professionalism and lack of discipline weve seen such patterns recently in the olympic scandal which revealed that the russian federal security service fsb the main successor agency to the soviet unions committee for state security kgb was secretly swapping out illegally drugged athletes urine samples for cleaner ones and in the effort to influence the us presidential election vil mirzayanov who helped develop novichok believes that moscow was confident the chemical would not be discovered advertisement in this scenario russian security forces are simply eliminating former agents while eliminating defectors was standard in the old kgb playbook the practice fell out of favor in the s but it has returned under putins rule skripals poisoning obviously parallels the assassination of alexander litvinenko with another a rare and highly toxic poison polonium a byproduct of nuclear fission polonium like novichok can be produced only by a state not by individuals litvinenkos assassination was one of many a buzzfeed investigation found suspicious deaths on british soil that were allegedly linked to russias security services among the victims were russian whistleblower alexander perepilichny who helped western prosecutors uncover money laundering schemes used by corrupt russian officials and russian oligarch boris berezovsky who spent the last years of his life in exile and in opposition to the kremlin interestingly last week berezovskys friend nikolai glushkov was allegedly murdered in london or did russia want to make an international point some observers believe that novichok is too powerful a weapon to attempt to use discreetly one former russian special services employee argues that its too dirty to be used casually and that given the high risks of collateral casualties the goal must have been to attract attention indeed people received medical treatment following the skripal poisoning according to british police advertisement why might the kremlin have wanted to attract attention to its attack on skripal and his daughter internationally the kremlin might have intended to exert pressure on the west the kremlins foreign policy tool kit includes a technique called reflexive control designed to cause a stronger adversary voluntarily to choose the actions russia prefers by shaping that adversarys perceptions of the situation such techniques are also intended to test a target countrys response to assess what might be expected after future provocations russia may be trying to promote an image of itself as a state willing to violate international norms and rules if its interests are not met the kremlin has used such tactics in the past notably by sending russian jets to violate ukrainian airspace after russia annexed crimea interestingly skripals poisoning came just several days after putins bellicose federal assembly address in which he threatened the west with a new generation of nuclear weapons since skripal allegedly continued collaborating with western intelligence after he arrived in britain in a scandalous poisoning could have been a revenge attack for handing over russian secrets and meant to teach britain a lesson about collaborating with russias defectors arriving at a foreign affairs council in brussels march british foreign secretary boris johnson said russian denials are increasingly absurd video reuters or is putin putting other russians on notice that defecting will have consequences advertisement skripals poisoning may also be designed to achieve domestic policy goals some commentators suggested that the poisoning might have been intended to help putin rally the country around the flag and win the march presidential election however putin who didnt face any serious competition in sundays election is unlikely to require this backing moscows aggressive foreign policy steps such as its war with georgia and intervention in ukraine did not appear to be timed to relate to russias electoral cycles rather putin may be signaling other possible defectors among russias former operatives and elites london has been attracting an increasing number of russian businessmen and officials fleeing for a better life away from the more and more repressive russian state russian elites have been increasingly unhappy with the kremlins bellicose policies and the corresponding multiplying western sanctions putin might feel he has to remind them that defecting has serious consequences in december boris titov one of the prokremlin presidential candidates campaigned in london to try to persuade exiled russian oligarchs to return to russia apparently on the kremlins instructions last week one of russias state tv anchors directly warned the prospective russian traitors in england of what they might expect advertisement the kremlin might be signaling its ruthlessness to the russian opposition as well highlevel russian businessmen such as evgeny chichvarkin and vladimir ashurkov who are known for their opposition to the kremlin and who currently reside in london have sometimes noticed that they were being shadowed by russian security skripal contacted the british police some time before the poisoning and expressed concerns about his safety andrei sidelnikov an opposition activist currently living in london says russian security service operatives periodically follow him around the city i am wondering who of us is going to be next sidelnikov recently told me in the meantime prokremlin media outlets have proposed a series of contradictory explanations for the poisoning apparently designed to obfuscate the reality and confuse the wider audience both at home and abroad with putin returning to office after this election moscow appears poised to continue disrupting world politics for years to come correction an earlier version of this post stated that vil mirzayanov created novichok as opposed to helped develop it we regret the error maria snegovaya is a phd candidate at columbia university and an adjunct fellow at the center

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/putin-lies-action-moscow-salisbury-attack,639,494,in the vladimir putin showreel doubtless given repeat airings in the runup to sundays presidential faux election theres usually a place among the shirtless poses and horseback shots for images of the russian leader on the judo mat putin is such a committed judoka he has even put out his own instructional dvd wittily titled lets learn judo with vladimir putin it is not hard to explain putins enthusiasm for the martial art beyond its conspicuous machismo for judo allows the skilled practitioner to turn his opponents strengths into weaknesses and his own weaknesses into strengths for the past fortnight since the attempted murder of sergei and yulia skripal on the streets of salisbury putin has been giving a masterclass in how its done he has shown us how he sees for example the basic tenets of democracy whether thats free speech or belief in the rule of law evidence and due process to us those may look like the firm pillars that hold up a decent society but to a blackbelt such as putin they are rotten timbers ripe for a good kicking and liable to bring down the whole edifice take the political response to the salisbury attack on the face of it jeremy corbyns position as set out in the guardian yesterday seems eminently reasonable anxious to learn the lessons of the iraq catastrophe of he suggested we exercise patience lets wait and see where the investigation leads lets not rush way ahead of the evidence after all said his spokesman the intelligence agencies had been wrong before such a stance seems not just authentic for corbyn given his long record but also right who could possibly be against such a call for calm and deliberation put aside the fact that corbyns position is oddly contradictory if moscows guilt is not certain why does he support theresa mays expulsion of russian diplomats by his own logic surely that move too should wait until the case is proven put aside too the mismatch between this incident and the iraq case no one is calling for military action now back then the argument was over whether to deal preemptively with a threat of weapons of mass destruction that might or might not exist in a country several thousand miles away this time the question is how to respond to an event that has actually happened and which no one denies the use of a chemical weapon against civilians on a british street whats more there is russias past form the rollcall of murdered enemies of the russian state is long we know moscow is not above eliminating its critics in britain witness the death of alexander litvinenko and the murder inquiry scotland yard announced late on friday into the death of the russian businessman nikolai glushkov as for the suggestion that a criminal gang rather than agents of the kremlin may be responsible the experts are sceptical its nearimpossible to use novichok without getting killed unless you know what youre doing its for these reasons among others that britain germany france and the us issued a joint statement concluding that there was no plausible alternative explanation for the attack in salisbury but those pleas to delay judgment point to a wider error a misreading of the nature of the contemporary russian state in fairness to corbyn he is not the only one to make this mistake donald trumps initial reaction was also to plead for patience and to suggest that guilt may lie elsewhere as he memorably put it as soon as we get the facts straight if we agree with them we will condemn russia or whoever it may be the error here is to assume that moscows attitude to evidence and due process is the same as that of nations still governed by the rule of law but in putins russia lying has long been a routine and integral part of statecraft no matter how copious the evidence putin will think nothing of denying it in he swore there were no russian troops in crimea even though reporters could see them with their own eyes anyone could buy russian uniforms he said weeks later he was paying tribute to those russian troops with nary a blush labour should be calling for an euwide visa blacklist of kremlin officials that same year moscow waved aside evidence relating to the downing of malaysian airlines flight mh over ukraine it continues to block investigations into the use of chemical weapons by its syrian vassal bashar alassad putin denies hacking the us presidential elections in the face of colossal evidence and of course he denied any role in the murder of litvinenko though he did later ensure the killer got a seat in the russian parliament thereby granting him immunity from prosecution what meaning does due process have when dealing with such a regime moscow would not cooperate in good faith with an investigation by the international chemical weapons watchdog offering up evidence that might be incriminating they would see such an inquiry instead as a useful delaying tactic one that would allow them to issue yet more denials wild counteraccusations salisbury was an mi plot to distract from brexit and obfuscation disseminated either through their rt propaganda tv station or by their army of bots and online enablers that way they could generate yet more of the fog of doubt and confusion that they believe undermines the wests confidence and strengthens them this is the putin modus operandi spread doubt until the public grows exhausted and concludes that the truth is unknowable so we need to be cleareyed about the nature of the threat we should not overstate it russias economy is no bigger than the combined output of the netherlands and belgium but nor should we underestimate it corbyn condemned the putin regime for its conservative authoritarianism that doesnt quite cut it norman tebbit is a conservative authoritarian vladimir putin is a murderous tyrant who kills or jails his rivals and has the blood of hundreds of thousands of syrians chechens and others on his hands labour should be calling for an euwide visa blacklist of kremlin officials restricting their ability to enjoy europes playgrounds for a crackdown on the city banks and law firms that allow putins allies money to be laundered through london and as mp margaret hodge urges today for mays proposed transparent property register to be brought forward from to right now but above all labour and the rest of us need to see putin for what he is not an admirable bulwark against us imperialism but an ultranationalist bent on fomenting hate and division an idol to nigel farage marine le pen and trump who sees our democratic and legal traditions as weaknesses to be exploited we must give him that chance no longer

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/28/new-zealands-claim-it-has-no-russian-spies-is-perplexing-why-is-it-isolating-itself,655,504,the new zealand labour governments refusal to join international collective action against russia over the nerve agent attack in the uk on former spy sergei skripal is perplexing the nation solidarity coalition expelling russian diplomats and intelligence officers from their soil includes all of new zealands major security partners as well as important trade counterparts new zealand is a member of the five eyes signals intelligence collection and sharing network including australia canada the uk and the us so it has better knowledge than most as to what evidence the uk has to indicate that vladimir putins regime ordered the hit on sergei skripal new zealand is an extraregional nato and eu associate and like the majority of the members of the coalition it is a democracy new zealand fashions itself as a good international citizen and honest broker in international affairs so it seems odd that it would not join its closest diplomatic interlocutors in what is largely a symbolic gesture of repudiation of russian misbehaviour abroad the decision was made all the more quixotic by prime minister jacinda arderns claim that there are no undeclared russian intelligence operatives in new zealand and hence there was no need to expel anyone she claimed to have assurances from the ministry of foreign affairs and trade mfat that was the case even though mfat has no counterintelligence function nor the ability to ascertain who is and who is not a russian intelligence officer declared or undeclared that is the job of the security intelligence service so why has new zealand chosen to isolate itself pragmatic assessments usually inform foreign policy decisions particularly those involving choosing sides in international disputes that is particularly true for small states when confronted with the demands of quarreling powers to take a position in favour of one side or the other lilliputians such as new zealand usually think long and hard before taking an unpopular stand particularly amongst friends new zealands decision not to participate in the solidarity coalition was made in the face of a direct request from the may government and in spite of the fact that the collective action is largely symbolic although russian intelligence operations will be adversely affected in places like the uk us and germany many of those being expelled are normal diplomats who can be recalled at some future date so the downside to joining the coalition would seem relatively small even with russian threats of retaliation and the upside in terms of being seen to be a good diplomatic partner that supports international norms could well outweigh whatever the russians can respond with perhaps there lies the explanation new zealands foreign policy in recent years has been trade obsessed and speculation has it that members of the foreign policy establishment see the possibility of advancing a bilateral free trade agreement fta with russia in the vacuum left by the trade sanctions levied on it in the wake of the ukrainian invasion and annexation of crimea new zealand and russia opened talks on trade before the sanctions were imposed then suspended them afterwards official advice from the foreign ministry is that violating the sanctions regime to try to exploit a possible window of opportunity vis a vis russia is counterproductive at best but talk in wellington is that some in the labourled government are keen to resume negotiations so taking a contrary stance on response to the nerve agent assassination attempt is a means of currying favour with putin at a time when other competitors are not it is also possible that labour is attempting to stake out its independent and autonomous foreign policy credentials after nine years of the previous governments rapprochement with the us and the other five eyes partners given the animosity felt towards donald trump and to a lesser extent theresa may amongst labour supporters as well as those of its coalition partners new zealand first and the green party this could be a way of playing david versus goliaths for domestic audiences and yet pragmatic assessment of the situation would advise the labourled government to address the short and long term costs and benefits of alienating its most important foreign partners by refusing to join in the symbolic repudiation of russia by any objective measure to include the possibility of securing bilateral trade with putins regime the costs of doing so will clearly outweigh the benefits even if it does not interfere with the daily business of intelligence sharing and military cooperation with the five eyes and other security partners that is because in the diplomatic world the shadow of the future hangs heavily over present decisionmaking the consequences of being shortsightedly contrarian are determined not by the contrarian but by those refused support on a matter of international consequence and foreign policy alignment with that in mind the question remains what does the new zealand labour government expect to gain from its contrarian stance paul g buchanan is director of th parallel assessments an aucklandbased geopolitical and strategic risk analysis consultancy

the us says are engaged in aggressive collection here in the us us officials said the spies at the un were abusing their residence privileges under the un headquarters agreement they said there were more than russian spies in the us and the expulsions would significantly reduce russian espionage capabilities in the country the expelled russians have seven days to leave the country mark simakovsky a former russia desk director at the pentagon said the mass expulsions by such a large number of countries acting in concert were unprecedented but moscow still had plenty of ways to spy on the west most russian intelligence operations are not being done by agents acting under cover of diplomatic protocols said simakovsky now a senior nonresident fellow at the atlantic council most likely the poisoning of the skripals was not done by anyone in an embassy or consulate daniel fried a former state department sanctions coordinator said the only measures likely to have real effect on putins behaviour would be sanctions aimed at russian money in the west this is impressive but it is still the standard playbook fried said if we are serious about this we ought to think outside the box i

employee of state chemical research institute in paragraph moscowamsterdam reuters the british government says russia is to blame for poisoning former spy sergei skripal with a nerve agent and most chemical weapons specialists agree but they say an alternative explanation cannot be ruled out that the nerve agent got into the hands of people not acting for the russian state the soviet unions chemical weapons program was in such disarray in the aftermath of the cold war that some toxic substances and knowhow could have got into the hands of criminals say people who dealt with the program at the time could somebody have smuggled something out said amy smithson a biological and chemical weapons expert i certainly wouldnt rule that possibility out especially a small amount and particularly in view of how lax the security was at russian chemical facilities in the early s while nerve agents degrade over time if the precursor ingredients for the nerve agent were smuggled out back then stored in proper conditions and mixed recently they could still be deadly in a smallscale attack two experts on chemical weapons told reuters skripal and his daughter yulia remain in hospital in critical condition after being found unconscious on a bench in the city of salisbury on march a police officer was also harmed and remains in a serious condition british prime minister theresa may said on wednesday that there is no alternative conclusion other than that the russian state was culpable for the attempted murder of mr skripal and his daughter and for threatening the

intermediaries from leonid rink an employee of a state chemical research institute known as gosniiokht the same institute according to vil mirzayanov a soviet chemical weapons scientist who later turned whistleblower was part of the state chemical weapons program and helped develop the novichok family of nerve agents that britain has said was responsible for poisoning skripal in a statement to investigators after his arrest viewed by reuters rink said he was in possession of poisons created as part of the chemical weapons program which he stored in his garage on more than one occasion he said he sold the substances to supplement his income and pay down a debt the poison in the kivelidi case was sold in a deal brokered by an expoliceman contact of rinks rink handed over the poison in an ampoule hidden inside a pen presentation box in a meeting at moscows belorussky station according to his statement rink received a oneyear suspended prison sentence for misuse of powers according to boris kuznetsov who was a lawyer for kivelidis business partner during the trial kuznetsov said he believed his client was innocent and that kivelidi was poisoned by rogue intelligence officers acting without the knowledge of the russian president at the time boris yeltsin he added that he would share files from the case with the british authorities because he believed they could be relevant to the skripal investigation reuters was not able to contact rink state of disarray the soviet chemical weapons program was a sprawling operation spread across farflung provincial cities that incorporated the worlds largest chemical arsenal publicly declared at tonnes when the soviet union ceased to exist funding dried up scientists salaries were in several months of arrears staff morale slumped and facilities were left to fend for themselves with little government control or oversight according to a report published by the henry l stimson center a washington security thinktank and based on accounts from industry insiders physical security at the facilities was deficient slideshow images it said railroad entrances to the facilities were padlocked but unguarded and at some sites chemical weapons were stored in buildings with wooden doors and tiled roofs that an intruder could get into with little difficulty chemical weapons were stored in silos without tamperproof seals making it difficult to detect if small quantities were being siphoned off a second report by the stimson center four years later highlighted the risk of soviet chemical weapons scientists who earned a pittance when they were paid at all being recruited by criminals terrorists or rogue states all the ingredients for successful black marketeering are present through the chemical and biological

scientist the novichok family of nerve agents developed by the gosniiokht institute was tested in nukus uzbekistan in an interview with reuters on tuesday mirzayanov now resident in princeton new

less equipped than moscow to secure them us troops who arrived in uzbekistan after to establish an air base in the city of khanabad came across stockpiles of old munitions that had not been accounted

boris johnson hailed the strength and resolve of britains allies after holding talks with nato in brussels it came as scientists from the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw started tests on the substance used to poison sergei skripal and his daughter julia who remain in a critical condition in hospital mr johnson said the assassination attempt was not an isolated case but the latest in a pattern for reckless behaviour by the russian state contrary to russian allegations he said the uk was acting in punctilious accordance with the chemical weapons convention in the meantime russian denials grow increasingly absurd mr johnson added at one time they say that they never made novichok at another time they say that they did make novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed then again they say that they made novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to sweden or at the czech republic or slovakia or the united states or even america or the united kingdom i think what people can see is that this is a classic russian strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation johnson and nato secretary general jens stoltenberg in brussels on march ap mr johnson said that years after the assassination of alexander litvinenko in london they are not fooling anybody anymore and that many nato members had been affected by malign or disruptive russian behaviour britain has already announced the expulsion of russian spies and is considering other measures including using new unexplained wealth orders against targets mr putin dismissed claims of russian involvement in the nerve agent attack as nonsense as he was reelected president while his campaign team claimed the diplomatic row mobilised the nation in his support tass quoted kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov as saying sooner or later they will have to be responsible for these allegations they will either have to provide some evidence or apologise after securing a fourth term amid widespread claims of electoral fraud mr putin claimed that mr skripal and his daughter would have died instantly if a chemical warfare agent was used russia does not possess such agents he added we have destroyed all our chemical arsenals under control of international observers we are ready for cooperation and said that immediately we are ready to take part in all necessary probes but the will of the other side is needed for that so far we see none but the opcw has confirmed that neither russia nor any other state party declared the development of novichoks a group of nerve agents roughly translating as newcomer that were first developed by the soviet union putin claims that skripal would have died instantly if a chemical warfare agent was used pa only declared weapons in russias arsenal were destroyed while the precursor chemicals used to make novichoks can be legally stored for industrial and agricultural uses theresa may insisted that only russia had the capability motive and intent to carry out the attack in salisbury im clear that what we have seen shows that there is no other conclusion but that the russian state is culpable for what happened on the streets of salisbury the prime minister said both nato and the eu foreign affairs council supported the uks position as the diplomatic row

http://theconversation.com/sergei-skripal-attack-russian-embassy-is-fuelling-tensions-with-some-very-undiplomatic-tweets-93407,679,520,international tensions continue to run high following the assassination attempt on former russian spy sergei skripal accusations are flying between world leaders and in an unexpected twist one embassys twitter account is stoking the flames rather than helping to smooth relations russianembassy is pushing contention and propaganda sending out a stream of confrontational messages ever since the skripal incident twitter the account is already infamous for its polemical approach it has become an example of a new type of geopolitical strategy that centres around the power of digital diplomacy but where other governments use embassy accounts as tools for improving international relations the primary aim of russianembassy in moments of crisis seems to be circulating disinformation strange new role embassy twitter accounts have been taking on greater importance in recent years they demonstrate a dramatic shift in the ways in which diplomacy is now performed they are useful sources of information for citizens living abroad updating diasporic communities expats and tourists on upcoming events and celebrations and offering advice during political incidents and emergencies they also do their bit for nation branding but embassy twitter accounts have a more controversial function too they can be used to orchestrate certain governments strategic narratives when barack obama expelled russian diplomats in december for example russianembassy posted a picture of a lame duck alongside a tweet that said many will be glad to see the last of him amid rising tensions between russia and the west over lgbtq rights the account was used to portray europeans as gay pigs confined to concentration camps apparently an attack on western values its evident that the embassys social media strategy is one of belligerent controversy now amid the fallout from the double assassination attempt on skripal and his daughter russianembassy has doubled down on its aggressive strategy it has released a torrent of remarkably combative tweets directed at the british media and government the media it claims has shown its quality by accusing russia of involvement and cannot be trusted it even asked who will hold the british government accountable for groundlessly wrecking relations with russia the tweets have increased in intensity as international pressure has built the first few skripalrelated messages were fairly measured but the feed soon descended into the conspiratorial there were dark warnings about impending investigations and sanctions the account eventually deteriorated into outright whataboutery questioning why the foreign office is talking about skripal but has nothing to say about farright marches in ukraine these seemingly erratic messages have a coherent objective to subvert what the embassy perceives as incessant attacks from western governments and media against the russian state as the british government prepared to take punitive measures against the russian government the embassy again hit back with an unambiguous tweet that threatened retaliation the future of twiplomacy gone are the days of relying on back channels to negotiate diplomatic disputes embassy twitter accounts now play an important role on the international stage and are harnessing socalled twiplomacy with mixed results but a worrying precedent is being set for future diplomatic relations russianembassy is still fundamentally the digital embodiment of a diplomatic mission based in an overseas territory diplomats are increasingly turning to social media as a useful vehicle for progressing diplomatic relations but they may also be coerced in asserting certain geopolitical narratives by their governments a single tweet can turn international relations sour rival governments can even slide into twitter wars its true that russianembassy has become something of a viral hit thanks to its unorthodox and even humorous approach to a traditionally staid topic but it is not acting in a bubble the impact on diplomatic relations may be as significant as communications made through more traditional diplomatic channels the grey area that social media occupies means that accounts such as russianembassy can act with a brazenness and impunity that would not be acceptable for diplomats and ambassadors with no real arbiter over twiplomacy and its norms we can expect russianembassy to remain unaccountable for its conduct while social media accounts can certainly bridge the distance between embassies and the citizens they serve this is one shift that may end up harming more than helping

detection capabilities the defense secretary announced in a speech in which he again pushed for more military spending in the face of growing threats from russia and others the million us million investment in a new chemical weapons defense center comes just days after an exrussian spy and his daughter were left critically ill after being attacked with a sophisticated nerve agent in salisbury western england we have worldclass expertise at defence science technology laboratory porton down and today i can announce we will be strengthening this capability by investing million in a new chemical weapons defense center to ensure we maintain our cutting edge in chemical analysis and defense gavin williamson said at a rollsroyce facility in bristol on thursday the chemical threat was not just originating from russia he added in another move following the chemical attack british high readiness troops are to be vaccinated against anthrax the decision will ensure troops are protected and ready to deploy to areas where the risk of an anthrax attack exists britain has blamed the russian government for the nerve agent attack sparking an escalating row between the two nations which has led to the wholesale expulsion of russian diplomats from london and a threat by the putin administration to retaliate in kind the uk together with france germany and the us issued a statement earlier thursday saying there was no plausible alternative explanation than russia being behind the nerve agent attack the four nations condemned the first offensive use of a nerve agent in europe since the second world war saying it was an assault on british sovereignty a british police officer works with his sniffer dog in salisbury southern england on march as investigations and operations continue in connection with the major incident sparked after a man and a woman were apparently poisoned in a nerve agent attack on march daniel lealolivasafp via getty images the attack saw british troops in chemical warfare protection suits deployed on british streets seeking to track down traces of the russianmade nerve agent known as novichok if we doubted the threat russia poses to our citizens we only have to look at the shocking example of their reckless attack in salisbury williamson said asked whether britain and russia were entering a new cold war williamson said it is often described as a cool war that we are entering into i would say its feeling exceptionally chilly at the moment british defense spending during the cold war regularly topped percent of gross domestic product whereas now the figure is a fraction more than percent many in parliament would like to see that figure closer to percent the salisbury attack which also seriously injured a policeman may change the dynamics of the defensespending argument williamson who only took up the post as defence secretary in november as well as some of his service chiefs notably british army gen nick carter the chief of the general staff have recently been citing a rising threat from russia and others in part to justify spending more money on defense the defense secretary controversially warned recently that russian cyberattacks on britains infrastructure in the future could result in thousands of people dying warning that britain needed to prioritize investment in military capabilities williamson said britain had reached a profound moment in our history a crossroads where the choice before us is simple to sit back and let events overtake us or step forward this is our moment to retain our competitive advantage the ministry of defence is deeply embroiled in a debate with the treasury in an effort to secure an increase in its budget in order to avert a serious reduction in capabilities in order to balance the books a recent national audit office report on the mods billion defense equipment procurement and support plan for the next years reckoned the plan could be overcommitted by as much as billion the mod is currently undertaking a defense review what it calls the defence modernisation programme which is expected to be completed ahead of the nato summit in brussels in midjuly without additional funds and efficiency savings across the military service chiefs will have to find a range of cuts with some major programs and capabilities falling victim to the need to balance the books on a defense budget that last year totaled billion our modernizing defense program will make sure our country can respond to the changing nature of warfare and the new threats we face to british interests russia in particular is ripping up the rule book we only have to look at the reckless attack in salisbury williamson said one of the items likely to feature in the review is the issue of chemical biological radiation and nuclear or cbrn capabilities the new chemical warfare defense center could be part of this but with british attention on the sector generally considered inadequate since the joint cbrn regiment was axed as a result of the strategic defence and security review there could be more developments to come since britains cbrn capability has been the responsibility of the royal air force although the royal tank regiment formed a dedicated cbrn squadron in at this point its too early to know whether a joint forces cbrn regiment could be reconstituted andrew chuter

chris leslie mp prominent member of the dwindling new labour resistance to corbyn declared it is just not appropriate to push party political differences when our country is potentially under attack in response to the labour leaders comments in the commons last night liberal commentators new labour holdouts and angry tories all want politics kept out of the house of commons when security matters are debated but politics are key to how we respond to the salisbury nerve gas attack if the russian government did back attempted murder on british soil the uk needs to make a firm response far from being misjudged corbyn pointed to one of the most effective responses we can make he pointed to what the russians want from us and what we can do about it broadly speaking the russian oligarchs made their money from the wild east privatisations during the economic shock treatment of the s putins rule rests on reining in those oligarchs befriending some imprisoning others being rich in russia now means being friendly with putin the russian leaders business friends like the uk they want to trade and clean their money in the city invest it in london property and send their kids to british public schools they often want to keep open options to follow their money to the uk in case they fall out with putin financial sanctions on putinfriendly russians including seizing cash and assets in the uk could be a powerful weapon but one that is regularly ruled out this was made explicit in when deputy national security adviser hugh powell was photographed entering number with a document listing options for responses to russias ukraine invasion powells slipup exposed uk policy would not jeopardise city cash powells document said britain would not support for now trade sanctions or close londons financial centre to russians theresa may highly likely russia was responsible for poisoning of sergei skripal city interests the luxury property lobby and russialinked investors have a real interest in resisting sanctions powers these groups are also among the tories top funders may will have to run against tory donors interests to make a serious stand against putin far from playing politics corbyn was pressing this precise point after telling parliament this was a deeply alarming attack which the whole house condemns corby referred to huge fortunes often acquired in the most dubious circumstances in russia and sometimes connected with criminal elements have ended up sheltering in london and trying to buy political influence in british party politics corbyn called on the government to introduce new financial sanctions powers this isnt a vague gesture it is a concrete call mays government are currently resisting labours amendments to the sanctions and antimoney laundering bill that could introduce the socalled magnitsky powers sergei magnitsky was an anticorruption investigator who died after being assaulted in a russian prison in in response the us magnitsky act creates powerful sanctions powers labour want similar powers here corbyn was calling for specific powers and pressuring may to introduce them there is a good chance that the government will be forced to concede while backbenchers like chris leslie or john woodcock or yvette cooper make solemn and cross party noises corbyn has actually by acting like an opposition begun to shift

and the tory press spent weeks playing politics with an absurd and entirely fake story about corbyntheczechspy they played that silly game up to the point one mp was forced into a humiliating public apology by contrast corbyn is shocking faint hearted pundits by calling for actual policy changes there is a regular call to suspending politics for the sake of empty displays of unity but it usually gets us into a bad place the very worst foreign policy mistakes have been made when the front benches of both parties agreed to stand together in pound shop churchill poses the commons voted for invading iraq and bombing libya in the same spirit of nonpartisan unity against external enemies both decisions were vigorously backed by chris leslie and ids both were opposed by corbyn both interventions did nothing for security instead spreading chaos and misery corbyn talking about actual politics inside the houses of parliament makes some of the political class feel uncomfortable because real political change is outside their comfort zone but this is how change happens

worked for the irish independent the evening herald ireland on sunday and the irish daily mail western leaders and opinion formers believed sanctions and economic pressure would encourage russians to turn against vladimir putin they couldnt have been more wrong if youre not russian you probably havent heard of aleksey pushkov hes an influential academic politician and media personality who once ran the foreign affairs committee of the duma the lower house of the parliament and is widely considered to be close to the kremlin in the early hours of monday morning as the extent of vladimir putins latest presidential victory became clear he took to twitter to make a very important point western demonization of putin inspires the opposite effect in russia instead citizens rally around him and the election results confirm this influential russian politician commentator alexei pushkov says western demonization of putin causes the opposite effect in russia instead citizens rally around him and the election results confirm this bryan macdonald march pushkov is correct because putins latest landslide was partially made in the west slowing tide to understand why we need to rewind the clock to back then on the surface at least russia was doing well economically the ruble was trading around to the us dollar and the price of oil was high while the countrys reliance on the latter resource was always a poor longterm strategy it provided easy money and this meant russians could afford to travel to places and buy imported products which soviet citizens could only have dreamed of two decades earlier despite this a considerable amount of people werent happy and when the sitting president dmitry medvedev announced in september that he was stepping aside to support putins who was serving as prime minister return to the kremlin anger grew in some sections of society especially the probusiness and liberal factions you see for them medvedev represented the promise of liberalization and westernization and the return of putin was seen as a step backwards towards nationalism conservatism and even authoritarianism in december the duma election took place with united russia the party associated with putin and medvedev failing to win a majority of the vote some alleged the contest had been falsified and the partys real share was even smaller read more americas elite thinks it has a divine right to rule the world as a result protests kicked off largely centered in moscow but there were also demonstrations in many provincial cities including khabarovsk more than km from moscow where i resided at the time at this moment one thing was very clear many russians sought a new sense of identity and the various postsoviet factions were heading for a showdown one which took place over the following months in december the western media had decided to christen the unrest as the snow revolution a meme which conjured memories of similar events in ukraine and georgia labelled orange and rose respectively and this was a serious error because russians werent looking for the overthrow of their state and at least in the heartland many feared a return to the anarchy of the s thus while certain capital city circles sizzled with talk of revolution where i was living people seemed horrified by the very idea this is the rich moscow elite marching these guys have nothing in common with me was a typical statement while others seemed to think the protestors were ungrateful because after all their very prosperity was mostly down to putin who had inherited a basket case economy in and greatly improved living standards nevertheless things became very tense for a while with no less a figure than mikhail gorbachev publicly calling for putin to resign of course putin didnt heed gorbys call instead he continued his presidential campaign and in march won handsomely with a score of nationally but only in moscow mixed signals now this is where i need to explain something the protests were more or less a big smoke phenomenon and it explains why western media correspondents who are all based in moscow and have little understanding of the rest of russia beyond its occasional novelty value made their readers and viewers believe something substantial was stirring when the reality was less dramatic because in a place like khabarovsk the movement gained no traction beyond a bit of muttering in cafes and between close family and friends putin realized this and learned a lesson in his first two terms hed probably spent too much time worrying about the moscow elite from now on he was going to focus on his base the ordinary folk who keep russia working and little did he know at the time but the west was about to lend a helping hand the kremlin believed hillary clinton had interfered in russias unrest but her influence was limited even if putins team regarded it as a betrayal however americas behavior in ukraine in was another matter entirely this was the us openly intervening in street protests in russias neighbor and clintons former assistant secretary of state victoria nuland was leading the charge eventually even going so far as choosing a new government in the aftermath for russians it was incredible ukraine home to entire regions where ethnic russians constitute a significant majority was as they saw it being destabilized in a westernbacked coup something which meant that crimea part of russia for hundreds of years until nikita khrushchev signed it away in the s could have feasibly wound up housing nato bases thus when putin decided to reabsorb the peninsula in the spring of his popularity ratings reached unprecedented levels because russians believed the west had betrayed them and since then the eu and the us have played into his hands wide awake russians are fully aware of western scaremongering about their country and the demonization of their president they see it on news sites across social media and on tv and the ones who cant understand english can even read russian translations of the western press on a dedicated website inosmi which incidentally is state funded furthermore in addition to the constant barrage of media delirium the nato countries sanctions policy has created a besieged fortress mentality in russia indeed andrey kondrashov putins campaign spokesman summed this up on sunday night turnout is higher than we expected by about percent for which we must say thanks to great britain he said with tongue surely in cheek referring to the fallout from a spy poisoning drama in the uk we were pressured exactly at the moment when we needed to mobilize voters whenever russia is accused of something indiscriminately and without any evidence the russian people unite around the center of power and the center of power is certainly putin today in putin was under pressure in moscow but this weekend he secured over of the vote in the capital and in st petersburg where he managed six years ago he can now boast a score and it has happened at a time when russians have endured a deep recession with falling real wages during a painful but necessary economic restructuring after the previous resourcedriven model exhausted itself today even liberal educated and cosmopolitan dwellers of the two big cities generally support the status of crimea and now resent the west for its antirussia hysteria whereas in many saw the us as a country to aspire to now they are disappointed with washington and believe the us to be fundamentally opposed to respecting any of russias vital interests read more putins landslide victory to attract additional bn to russian economy thus ironically a western policy aimed at weakening putin and reducing russian resolve has completely backfired eighteen years after he first entered the kremlin the presidents position has never been stronger or more secure and he can thank the dysfunctional and selfdestructive policy of the united states and the european union a lot of which is influenced by too much reliance on russia experts who dont really understand the country at all and it shows think your friends would be

has certainly taken british minds off brexit it has exhilarated the press it has given theresa may an immense boost and helped the defence lobby in its campaign for more money there is nothing democracy seems to enjoy so much as contemplating war to unite it and raise its spirits it is never unpopular beforehand the official british response to the attempted killing of the skripals has been precipitate but measured we do not know the mix of greed vendetta and shambles that may have fuelled the salisbury outrage but it is hard not to treat moscow as guilty until proved innocent mays portfolio of expulsions and ostracisms is the traditional diplomatic ballet it has received welcome support from the us france and germany matter closed sadly not history warns us to distinguish the banality of a single incident from its wider contribution to an emerging crisis when archduke franz ferdinand was shot in sarajevo in the killer was not a state agent but a terrorist with a gun it could have been settled by a mediating conference instead a continent roused to war fever craved escalation soon austria declared war on serbia germany on russia and france on germany as ajp taylor wrote afterwards nothing caused the first world war statesmen miscalculated and became prisoners of their own weapons at a certain point armed conflict was unavoidable as nations raced to reenact some primitive tribal rivalry russias method of settling its internal feuds is obscene and archaic the bbcs vivid profile of vladimir putin this week depicted a paranoid moneyobsessed bully who in an international context needed handling with firmness and clarity but even if the skripal poisoning was state sponsored it was clearly a specific act against an individual like the litvinenko killing why elevate it as may did this week to the unlawful use of force by the russian state against the uk parliament parroted the same nonsense the tories tom tugendhat said the poisoning if not an act of war was certainly a warlike act labours chris leslie and john woodcock worked themselves into a lather over our country under attack and the gravity of the threat russia poses to this nation in these bidding wars of exaggeration words lose all meaning attacking people with poison is detestable so are russias infantile cyberattacks and crude fake news trolls they are unfriendly acts but they are not war why be driven by some fiendish yearning for them to be so ever since the collapse of the soviet union in the west has revelled in the humiliation of russia every act of the eu and nato after was to the same destructive end russias neighbours were welcomed into the eu nato extended its defensive border to the edge of the russian federation despite then president boris yeltsin and to an extent germany pleading with the west not to play with fire as yeltsin plunged into his botched privatisations in the s london egged them on by opening its banks to handle russias stolen billions britain was complicit in creating the worlds greatest kleptocracy brazenly and for a quarter of a century even this week the prime minister lacked the guts to face down the city of london and call a halt to russian money laundering all this is a grim echo of how the allies treated germany after versailles in they rubbed its nose in defeat occupying its territory destroying its dignity and stripping it of its flimsy wealth germany eventually found refuge in dictatorship when in russia found in putin a leader capable of asserting a degree of order staging a nationalist revival the west and nato seemed almost to sigh with relief devoid of ideology or creed putin was a cynical autocrat of the old school he was eager to liberate his country from the stain of cold war defeat he wanted to reassert tsarist supremacy over russias space its russianspeaking neighbours in parts of georgia ukraine and possibly the baltics nato had a recognisable enemy putin duly feasted on an image created for him by the west of a russia rising alone above a sea of misunderstanding encirclement and ostracism a country with little to be proud of but pride itself his every misbehaviour seemed to invite an overresponse the the west kept them coming as if wanting to strengthen him even on its own terms the west can have no interest in declaring cold war even on its own terms the west can have no interest in declaring cold war it may indeed be that putin only understands power in an enemy and when he clearly oversteps a mark as now he needs to be sent a firm message but he is not another stalin he is not napoleon eager to bestride europe russia is not the soviet empire it is rather a dangerous bundle of insecurities putin is riddled with what freud called the narcissism of small differences nothing could be more calculated to exacerbate them as western confrontation denying contact and engagement with russia and its people may is thus playing putins game by exploiting each incident as a statist threat as she does threats from isis and world terrorism it is the oldest trick in the populist book it nationalises a crime it summons patriotism to the suppression of reason it gets in the way of proportionality it raises the risk of mistakes camus wrote that plagues and wars take people equally by surprise the idea that skripal may be the franz ferdinand of the next european conflict may seem ludicrous yet the wests responses to postsoviet russia however reasonable in the short term have been disastrous in general a war with russia would be the wests fault

investigators and his own boss about his role in a news media disclosure about hillary clinton just days before the presidential election and authorized the release of information to advance his personal interests according to a justice department watchdog report president donald trump already furious over a forthcoming book from fired fbi director james comey lashed out after the reports release by saying mccabe had lied lied lied the inspector general report concludes that mccabe allowed fbi officials to disclose nonpublic information to a wall street journal reporter for a story about an investigation into the clinton foundation violating agency rules and then misled fbi officials when questioned about it it also reveals starkly contradictory accounts from mccabe and comey about how the conversations with the reporter had come to take place file in this june file photo thenacting fbi director andrew mccabe appears before a senate intelligence committee hearing about the foreign intelligence surveillance act on capitol hill in washington mccabe misled investigators multiple times about his role in a news media disclosure about hillary clinton just days before the presidential election according to a justice department watchdog report the report alleges that mccabe authorized fbi officials to speak with a wall street journal reporter for a story about an investigation into the clinton foundation and then misled fbi and justice department officials when later questioned about it ap photoalex brandon file mccabe who was fired two days before his scheduled retirement last month denied the reports allegations in a detailed rebuttal statement he said that when he believed his answers to the inspector general were misunderstood he went back and tried to correct them mccabes statement noted that as deputy director he had full authority to authorize sharing information with the media and said he permitted subordinates to do so in this case to correct a false narrative that he had tried to stymie an fbi probe into the clinton foundation the conversation was done to protect the institutional reputation of the fbi as a nonpolitical and professional investigative agency and therefore was squarely within the public interest exception to the fbis prohibition on sharing sensitive material the statement said mccabe has also said his dismissal was part of the trump administrations ongoing war on the fbi and special counsel robert muellers russia investigation adding that he was singled out because of the role i played the actions i took and the events i witnessed in the aftermath of comeys firing the inspector general report does not square with the republican narrative of the fbi as a politically biased institution since the oct story contained derogatory information about clinton and underscored fbi interest in investigating her foundation but its conclusion may also be hard for democrats to embrace given its harshly critical suggestion that mccabe had put his personal reputation above the interests of the fbi regardless the report immediately provided fodder for trumps public attacks on mccabe a longtime target of the presidents ire especially because of revelations that his wife during a failed state senate run had accepted campaign contributions in from the political action committee of thenvirginia gov terry mcauliffe a close clinton ally the president has made a concerted twitterdriven effort to impugn mccabe as a partisan hack accusing him of covering up unspecified lies and corruption at the fbi and calling his firing a great day for democracy on friday trump said the inspector generals report was a total disaster for mccabe and asserted mccabe is controlled by comey no collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes trump tweeted a lawyer for mccabe michael bromwich said he was considering filing a defamation lawsuit against trump and his colleagues he responded to trumps tweet by sarcastically thanking him for providing even more material for such a lawsuit the inspector general report was sent to congressional committees and obtained by the associated press rep trey gowdy the republican chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee said the report showed the firing was justified but sen dianne feinstein the top democrat on the senate judiciary committee called the firing overtly political the findings which had trickled out in news reports over the last month led fbi disciplinary officials to recommend that the justice department fire mccabe attorney general jeff sessions dismissed him for what he described as a lack of candor mccabe appointed deputy director in had been a close comey ally and passionately defended him in a congressional hearing soon after his firing he could be an important witness for mueller who is investigating trump for possible obstruction of justice including his motivation for firing comey last may yet the report makes clear that the mccabe and comey were at odds over how the conversations with the reporter unfolded and exactly how it had been approved mccabe told the inspector general that he had told comey the day after the story was published that he had authorized officials to share details of a conversation he had with a top justice department official about the clinton foundation investigation the conversation involved an encounter in which mccabe confronted the official over the suggestion that the fbi should not be taking overt investigative actions against the clinton foundation during the course of the election by asking are you telling me that i need to shut down a validly predicated investigation the official replied of course not according to the wall street journal story according to the report mccabe said comey told him that he thought it was a good idea to rebut a narrative that the fbi was succumbing to political pressure and not aggressively pursuing the clinton foundation but comey told investigators that mccabe did not tell him he had approved sharing details of the call and in fact had left him with the opposite impression i dont remember exactly how but i remember some form or fashion and it could have been like can you believe this crap how does this stuff get out kind of thing comey is quoted as saying in the report but i took from whatever communication we had that he wasnt involved in it  online inspector generals report

conspicuously quiet about the recent chemical attack against a former russian spy and his daughter in the uk the white house on monday condemned the attempted assassination as reckless indiscriminate and irresponsible but declined to back the uks claim that the russian government was behind the attack trump finally issued a statement of solidarity with the uk on tuesday morning saying that if the uk believed russia was behind the attack i would certainly take that finding as fact nationalsecurity experts were baffled and alarmed by trumps delay in offering a public comment about a statesponsored chemical attack on the soil of americas closest ally this month president donald trump made time to attack oprah winfrey the failing new york times sleepy eyes chuck todd pocahontas and fake as hell cnn but it took him a full day to stand in solidarity with the uss closest ally as it grapples with the fallout from a russian chemical attack carried out on its soil the uk concluded on monday that it was highly likely the kremlin ordered the attempted assassination of yearold sergei skripal and his yearold daughter yulia in salisbury england earlier this month skripal a former russian military intelligence officer was a doubleagent for the uk and has resided in the country since when he was traded as part of a spy swap between the uk and russia investigators have said the skripals were poisoned by the nerve agent novichok which the soviet union developed in the s and s british prime minister theresa may gave russia a deadline of late tuesday to offer a credible response to the uks findings she said if it did not she would conclude that the attack was an unlawful use of force by the russian state against the united kingdom asked about the attempted murder three times during mondays briefing white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said it was reckless indiscriminate and irresponsible when reporters pressed her about whether she would name russia as the perpetrator as the uk did sanders declined to do so former us secretary of state rex tillerson later said the attack clearly came from russia and vowed it will trigger a response following tillersons hardline comments about russia trump announced in a tweet tuesday that he was replacing tillerson with cia director mike pompeo while answering questions about tillersons ouster on tuesday morning trump at last acknowledged russias likely role in the skripal attack trump told reporters that as soon as we get the facts straight if we agree with them we will condemn russia or whoever it may be referring to the uks findings he added it sounds to me like they believe it was russia and i would certainly take that finding as fact nationalsecurity experts were baffled and alarmed by trumps delayed reaction to the chemical attack hanging the uk out to dry apbbc newsnight richard kauzlarich the former deputy assistant secretary of state in the bureau of european affairs said the white house should have backed the british from the beginning when you have the british come out as clearly and decisively as they did about who was responsible the logic and gravity of the situation would require the president to say something in solidarity he told business insider it should be almost automatic especially with an ally this close to the us edward price the former senior director of the national security council under president barack obama echoed that view for years we heard from voices on the political right that america couldnt possibly confront its adversaries without first clearly naming them he said and on monday we heard the white house press secretary condemn the act but very deliberately skirt the actor which by all accounts appears to be moscow in this case he added that not only did the us effectively hang the uk out to dry by not naming russia at first but that it was also signaling to russian president vladimir putin that he is free to act with impunity including by carrying out deadly acts in the uk the skripals attempted murder has prompted many comparisons to the death of former russian spy and putin critic alexander litvinenko litvinenko like skripal was a russian defector who had been granted political asylum in the uk and later became a source for british intelligence a decade after litvinenko suddenly fell ill and died in november authorities found that officers working for russias security service poisoned him with the radioactive agent polonium and that putin was probably behind it russian leaders seem to go out of their way to get rid of anybody that seems to be in their way someone whos betrayed them someone whos interrupting the money flow and they dont seem to care about borders joe serio an american author who spent nearly years with the antiorganized crime unit of moscows police told the associated press they just go wherever they have to go to get their guy russian state television news anchor kirill kleimenov issued a chilling message to that effect in russia days after the attack on the skripals implying that those who betray the russian government should expect shorter lives alcoholism drug addiction stress and depression are inevitable professional illnesses of a traitor resulting in heart attacks and even suicide kleimenov said what will it take alexei nikolsky kremlin pool photo ap images moscow scoffed at the uks latest accusations linking it to the skripals attempted assassination dismissing them as a circus show the russian embassy in london tweeted somewhat sarcastically on saturday what a coincidence both litvinenko and skripal worked for mi the foreign intelligence arm of the british government meanwhile the white houses initial refusal to condemn russia marks yet another incident in which the trump administration for whatever reason is not prepared to put russia on the spot kauzlarich said and russia will draw the conclusion that anybody would that if this president for reasons no one can understand will not criticize russia on something this blatant what will it take all of us who have been around the block find it bizarre that we would not be behind the brits on this he added theyve earned it russia hasnt mark simakovsky a senior fellow and russia expert at the atlantic council echoed that claim and said the white houses delay in backing up the uk was likely why tillerson felt the need to issue a stronger statement condemning russia on monday evening the us and uk share intelligence and details about who was behind this attack likely reached the white house pretty quickly simakovsky said tillerson probably recognized that it was abnormal for the white house to go so long without issuing a statement supporting the uks findings and felt like he had to step in to fill that gap nato threw its support behind the uk following its assessment of the attempted murder making it a point to highlight the russian governments likely role in the horrendous and completely unacceptable chemical attack if youve got an organization like nato of which the us is a member essentially saying the same thing the british government and the us secretary of state did kauzlarich said it makes the contrast between the white houses initial silence even more vivid in historical terms this is far from normal price said but for whatever reason its become the new normal under president trump

scheduled to brief reporters about the shakeup at foggy bottom was confirmed by a state department official west wing officials had accused him in recent weeks of privately criticizing white house decisions to reporters asked tuesday about the accusation goldstein said i spoke for the secretary of state that was part of my role as the undersecretary the president and his top diplomat reached a breaking point over the past week and media inquiries about the fraught relationship accelerated the timing of the ouster white house officials said after kelly told him he was being let go tillerson asked that trump hold off on announcing the news until he had returned to the united states and kelly agreed one white house official said trump told reporters that he had been considering removing tillerson for a long time advertisement i actually got along well with rex but really it was a different mindset a different thinking trump said tuesday as he departed the white house for a trip to california when you look at the iran deal i think its terrible i guess he thought it was okay so we were not really thinking the same with mike mike pompeo we have a very similar thought process i think its going to go very well trump selected cia deputy director gina haspel to succeed pompeo as the agencys director she would become the first woman to run the spy agency both haspel and pompeo would need to be confirmed by the senate at a time when the closely divided chamber has stalled on confirming dozens of trump nominees haspel in particular could come under added scrutiny over her past role running one of the cia black site prisons where detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other interrogation methods widely denounced as torture the announcement of tillersons departure sent shock waves across the globe many us diplomats and foreign leaders reacted with disbelief because they assumed tillerson had finally begun to settle into his job after rumors of his ouster had swirled for months even taking on a nickname rexit advertisement in a statement first issued to the post trump praised both pompeo and haspel he highlighted pompeos educational background graduating first in his class from west point and with honors from harvard law school and celebrated the historic milestone of haspel becoming the first woman to lead the cia pompeo said in a statement that he was deeply grateful to trump and said he looked forward to representing him and the american people to the rest of the world to further americas prosperity trump also had words of praise for tillerson despite their welldocumented rifts finally i want to thank rex tillerson for his service a great deal has been accomplished over the last fourteen months and i wish him and his family well in his statement goldstein said the secretary had every intention of staying because of the critical progress made in national security and other areas he will miss his colleagues greatly at the department of state and the foreign ministers hes worked with throughout the world the secretary did not speak to the president and is unaware of the reason he is grateful for the opportunity to serve and believes strongly that public service is a noble calling advertisement the president has long clashed with tillerson who he believes is too establishment in his thinking trump felt it was important to make the change now as he prepares for possible highstakes talks with north korean leader kim jong un as well as upcoming trade negotiations three white house officials said tillerson was especially frustrated when trump last thursday unilaterally agreed to the meeting with the north korean leader kim while tillerson was traveling in africa according to officials familiar with his thinking tillerson had long expressed interest in a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff with north korea and was upset to have been left totally out of the loop when trump decided to move forward according to a white house official tillerson was routinely undermined in his post including by jared kushner the presidents soninlaw and a senior white house adviser who took charge of the middle east and mexico diplomatic portfolios advertisement tillerson also clashed frequently with national security adviser hr mcmaster and us ambassador to the united nations nikki haley among others state department officials took notice and were chagrined that pompeo did not cite tillerson when he appeared on television shows sunday to explain the north korea developments although he frequently complained to colleagues that trump was too mercurial and impulsive and voiced frustration that the president struggled to focus during meandering conversations tillerson was determined to stay in his job and would not quit according to one person who has discussed these concerns with the secretary tillersons stance this person said was if he wants me gone hell fire me on the flight back from nigeria tillerson appeared to break with the white house in his assessment of the poisoning of a former russian spy and his daughter in britain he singled out russia as responsible for the attack echoing the fingerpointing of the british government advertisement it came from russia tillerson said according to the associated press i cannot understand why anyone would take such an action but this is a substance that is known to us and does not exist widely earlier monday white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders condemned the attack as reckless indiscriminate and irresponsible and expressed solidarity with britain but would not say whether the united states believes russia was behind it pompeo long has been mentioned as tillersons most likely replacement as cia director the former republican lawmaker from kansas developed a warm relationship with trump often delivering the presidents daily brief to trump in person and racing over to the west wing at a moments notice to field the presidents queries on a range of topics pompeo often is found in a host of meetings that do not necessarily deeply involve his agency simply because trump likes him said one white house official sen tom cotton rark was initially mentioned as a replacement for pompeo but trump opted to promote from within by elevating haspel white house officials still reeling from the loss of a republican senate seat in alabama were reluctant to tap cotton and create a vacancy in arkansas and they thought cotton could be more useful to trump as a loyal ally in the senate according to officials familiar with the deliberations speculation about tillersons ouster has come in waves including in october after nbc news reported that the secretary of state had called trump a moron tillerson did not deny the remark tillerson spent his career at exxonmobil climbing the ranks at the oil giant to become chief executive officer where he cut deals across the middle east and in mexico having never worked in government before being named secretary of state he struggled to adapt to washingtons ways and the administrations culture of backstabbing tillerson emerged as one of the strongest voices in the administration critical of russia for months he has been saying russia clearly meddled in the us election even as trump shied away from any critical remarks trump seemed to resent pressure to stay the course on such issues as chinas trade practices the war in afghanistan and the iran nuclear deal those people said tillerson pushed trump to preserve the iran accord at least for now with a july pronouncement that iran was meeting its end of the bargain which curbs irans nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions trump said in a wall street journal interview that he regretted making that determination in october trump kept in place the sanctions waivers but warned he may not continue the policy when the next review is due in may although tillerson supported the approach to the war in afghanistan that trump announced last year he felt no need to frame us goals in the same maximal terms as the commander in chief where trump proclaimed on aug that our troops will fight to win tillerson laid out a much more modest agenda robert costa josh dawsey karen deyoung carol morello and brian murphy contributed to this report giftoutline gift

http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chemical-watchdog-ex-spy-poisoned-nerve-agent-russia-opcw-1.4615895,708,541,the international chemical weapons watchdog on thursday confirmed britains finding that a former spy and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent as russia continues to deny suggestions that it was behind the attack investigators from the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons a nobel peace prizewinning group said the nerve agent was of high purity britain says that means only a state with a sophisticated laboratory could have manufactured it the watchdogs report does not say who was responsible for the attack since that was outside the scope of its mission the opcws job was to identify the poison not to trace its origins or assign blame britain blames russia for the march poisoning of sergei skripal and his daughter yulia with a nerve agent developed by the soviet union russia denies any involvement saying britain hasnt provided any evidence for its assertion britain has called for an opcw meeting next week to discuss the results of the organizations report in a published summary of its findings the opcw did not name novichok the type of nerve agent previously cited by british prime minister theresa may but it confirmed the findings of the united kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical that was used in salisbury it said the name and structure of the toxin were included in the full classified report distributed to member states of the organization the novichok class of nerve agents was developed in the soviet union toward the end of the cold war and britain says it has evidence russia has continued to manufacture novichok agents in the last decade russia denies this and says the nerve agent used on the skripals could easily have been manufactured in another country no smoking gun the opcw report said the nerve agent used on the skripals was of high purity the purity makes it hard to tell when the agent was manufactured since without impurities it does not degrade over time britain says scientific analysis of the poison is only one of the factors that has led it to blame russia others include intelligence that russia has made nerve agents and studied how to use them for assassinations and the view of russian president vladimir putins government that traitors are legitimate targets but the uk does not possess a scientific smoking gun a sample of novichok from a russian lab to compare with the salisbury samples a forensic tent covering the bench where sergei and yulia skripal were found is repositioned by officials in protective suits in the centre of salisbury on march peter nichollsreuters georgy kalamanov russias deputy minister of industry and trade told the interfax news agency thursday its impossible to pinpoint the agents origin and reaffirmed moscows demand for a probe that would involve russia uk foreign secretary boris johnson welcomed the opcws report saying tests in four independent laboratories around the world all returned the same results there can be no doubt what was used and there remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible only russia has the means motive and record he said no one speaks for me or for my father the findings come after yulia skripal rejected russian embassy assistance as she recovers at an undisclosed location yulia was released from the hospital earlier this week but her yearold father is recovering more slowly i am not yet strong enough to give a full interview to the media as i one day hope to do yulia skripal said in a statement released wednesday by londons metropolitan police until that time i want to stress that no one speaks for me or for my father but ourselves the statement was released after yulias cousin viktoria gave a series of interviews about a telephone conversation between the two leading the british government to claim that russia was using viktoria skripal as a pawn in the dispute between the two sides the russian embassy in london questioned the authenticity of yulias statement saying it was crafted to support britains version of events and increases suspicions she is being held against her will british authorities must urgently provide tangible evidence that yulia is all right and not deprived of her freedom the embassy said in a statement the text has been composed in a special way so as to support official statements made by british authorities and at the same time to exclude every possibility of yulias contacts with the outer world consuls journalists and even relatives the embassy said the document only strengthens suspicions that we are dealing with a forcible isolation of the russian citizen the poisoning dispute has led to severe tensions between russia and the west and to the expulsions of hundreds of diplomats between them

wrong please try again later verifyerrors against the backdrop of salisburys beautiful cathedral a new word recently gained global notoriety but the three people who had the right to know most about novichok a nerve agent were oblivious to its sudden appearance in headlines around the world for they lay fighting for their lives in hospital former russian spy sergei skripal his daughter yulia and police detective sergeant nick bailey were all exposed to novichok or newcomer to use its more parochial translation from russian in the city on march the circumstances surrounding the case are still being investigated but the latest unconfirmed and improbable reports suggest that skripal may have been exposed through the air vents of his bmw car skripal was directly targeted and perhaps his daughter was too although it may simply have been yulias proximity to her father that resulted in her exposure bailey was affected by the nerve agent as he was one of the first to respond and came into contact with it at a location as yet unknown the police officers exposure is more likely to have been through contact with the nerve agent contaminating some surface at the time of writing the skripals remain in a critical condition in hospital bailey meanwhile has been discharged from hospital and is able to speak about his ordeal perhaps providing vital clues environmental sampling will provide the evidence showing where the skripals were most likely exposed and hopefully how that exposure occurred while the full facts have yet to come to light the novichok attack is developing into a fullblown international incident the uk and russia which britain has blamed for the attack are now engaged in an increasingly badtempered titfortat expulsion of diplomats the foreign secretary boris johnson even pointed the finger squarely at russian president vladimir putin himself we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the uk on the streets of europe for the first time since the second world war johnson said so how did we get here and why do these lethal chemical agents exist at all the first nerve agents the story stretches back to when the first nerve agent named tabun after the german word for taboo was synthesised by talented german chemist gerhard schrader schrader was investigating organophosphate compounds for the third reich in an effort to find suitable insecticides to improve crop yields he quickly discovered that tabun was too toxic to ever be used in farming as it would almost certainly kill those applying it a year later however he developed a second even more toxic nerve agent sarin in debriefings by allied intelligence officers after the second world war schrader said that hed been required to inform the nazi authorities about his discoveries but while germany made munitions with both tabun and sarin which were discovered at the end of the war they were never used against germanys opponents russian ambassador claims uk has stocks of novichok nerve agent reasons for this are unclear some historians cite hitlers own exposure to chemical weapons during the first world war and his apparent revulsion towards their use in battle others note churchills warning to hitler that any use by germany of chemical or biological agents would be met with a swift response but the most convincing reason is likely to be the one mooted by schrader himself schrader noted in his postwar debrief that other scientists around the world including in britain were working on organophosphate chemicals and believed that they were almost certain to have also discovered nerve agents so if germany used them other countries would use them on germany in fact schrader was wrong only germany had the chemicals going global after the second world war however the uk us and soviet union gained access to nazi chemical knowhow and many german scientists began working for the victors at the time the prevailing view was that chemical weapons would almost certainly be used in a future conflict and so the military usefulness of nerve agents such as tabun and sarin was investigated but tabun and sarin had their limitations they were well suited for use on a rapidly moving battlefront because they vaporised and broke down in contact with water and so would disappear rapidly after use but this left a gap in the arsenal sotospeak for more persistent longerlived agents these were developed in the uk in the s and include the now wellknown vx this was the nerve agent used in the assassination of kim jongnam the halfbrother of north korean leader kim jongun in kuala lumpur airport unlike sarin and tabun vxtype agents which have an oily texture and are very slow to evaporate were considered to be whats called areadenial chemicals any troops or vehicles moving through an area where vx had been used would have to be rigorously protected compromising their manoeuvrability and fighting efficiency nerve agents were evolving but so too were the kinds of targets for chemical weapons increasingly they were being used against civilians who controls them about different nerve agents have now been manufactured and all are listed and restricted under the chemical weapons convention novichoks are an exception because they have never been declared more on which later in the first world war before the arrival of nerve agents it was primarily troops who were affected by chemical weapons during that conflict some million military casualties were exposed to irritants such as chlorine and phosgene or the blistering agent mustard gas and around per cent of those affected died meanwhile about civilians were injured by chemical weapons during that war since the first world war however chemical weapons have been used by italy in abyssinia now ethiopia in by japan in china during the second world war by egypt in yemen between and by iraq in iran and kurdistan and between and by the syrian government against its own people sarin was also used in a attack on the tokyo subway by the aum shinrikyo doomsday cult killing and making thousands more ill this is not a comprehensive list but many of the victims of these attacks particularly in kurdistan and syria were civilians rather than troops evidence of iraqs chemical attack on civilians in the kurdistan town of halabja which included the use of sarin nerve agent accelerated discussions already underway on a comprehensive chemical weapons treaty at the un council on disarmament in the chemical weapons convention cwc was agreed in the convention became international law following ratification of the treaty by countries today countries are fully paidup members of the convention with only north korea israel south sudan and egypt still not part of the group however as the convention is international law these four countries are still bound by its provisions that any use of a chemical to deliberately harm another person constitutes use of a chemical weapon and is illegal the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw oversees implementation of the cwc and supervises destruction of declared chemical weapons and any production facilities for these weapons to date approximately per cent of declared stockpiles have been destroyed in october russia announced that it had destroyed its stocks

the opcw operates a control regime for chemicals that are either chemical weapons or could be used to make them every year each signatory to the convention is required to provide the opcw with details on the location manufacture use sale or disposal of these substances the opcw audits these returns and verifies them by random annual inspections of hundreds of military bases and chemical companies around the globe all manufacturing programmes that resulted in stocks of chemical weapons exceeding one tonne per year after january must be declared to the opcw but on march this year the opcw announced that it had never been notified about novichoktype nerve agents by any state so what is novichok and what does it do to its victims novichok family there is no doubt that nerve agents similar to the novichok family exist something that has been described by defectors from russia one of these was used to poison the skripals and bailey nerve agents including certain novichoks are part of the family of organophosphate compounds albeit at the most toxic end of the spectrum they all operate in a similar way by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ache the enzyme can be found in various locations in the body but its at the junctions between nerves and muscles where its activity is most critical ache regulates the message from nerve to muscle by inactivating the neurotransmitter acetylcholine acetylcholine binds to receptors at the neuromuscular junction instructing the muscle to contract the enzyme then removes this messenger splits it in two and with its removal from the receptor the muscle relaxes this cycle is repeated as often as required by the demands on the muscles inhibition of this removal and cleavage process sends all muscles into spasm and they no longer function normally the effects are wideranging with the most critical being on lung and heart function respiratory paralysis is common in severe poisoning and the resulting lack of oxygen to critical organs such as the heart and brain can have serious consequences if untreated it may be fatal exactly where when and by whom these chemicals were made however and how and who used them against the skripals remain unclear triggering a major international crisis the uk is now exercising its rights under the cwc and has asked the opcw to investigate russias novichok programme this is the first time one party to the cwc has accused another of attacking it with a chemical weapon it will be a major challenge for the opcw which has been invited to send inspectors to the uk to collect samples for testing the opcw will use its own laboratory in rijswijk next to the hague and perhaps one of some other designated facilities around the world to confirm the exact identity of the nerve agent once it is confirmed the opcw will endeavour to find out more however it has never pointed the finger of blame at a user its remit is to confirm the use or identity of chemical agents and it can be called upon to carry out inspections in countries accused of using one others such as the un will then assess the evidence and do the finger pointing this is what happened when syria was accused last year of using chemical weapons against its own population the cwc does not preclude bilateral action by its signatories and britain and russia have already begun expelling each others diplomats over the row russia has also closed the british council and a uk consulate in st petersburg on the ground but what of the situation on the ground in salisbury where the skripals were attacked nerve agents can poison somebody though inhalation ingestion or skin contact which is why investigators in salisbury are wearing full protective clothing and gas masks in fact it is now the investigators rather than the public who face the risk of sustained exposure to any contamination some people have so far been identified who may have been in contact with the agent but none beyond the skripals and bailey have shown any symptoms it was reported that the skripals were essentially comatose when discovered and so were unable to say how they felt but paramedics would likely have found the couple struggling to breathe they may also have noticed twitching muscles a glassy appearance to the eyes with pinpoint pupils and profuse salivation in hospital there may have been evidence of increasing fluid buildup in the lungs and their heart rates may either have been rapid or slowed and uneven effects on the brain would be less evident as the couple were unconscious but can include restlessness headache confusion and convulsions a part of the brain is concerned with regulation of respiration and this may be affected directly slowing breathing a fall in blood pressure is also likely possible treatments antidotes to reverse the clinical effects of nerve agents are available and are more likely to be successful if administered early about cases of less severe accidental poisoning and four severe ones have been reported since in all of the severe cases the person poisoned lost consciousness and breathing was inhibited but prompt treatment by doctors who were nearby and aware of the potential for exposure resulted in the victims full recovery in a quirk of fate the uks own defence teams against chemical weapons are located at porton down just outside salisbury indeed there have also been tests on hundreds of military servicemen with small doses of nerve agents and in after one poorly conducted test in the uk a yearold leading aircraftman ronald maddison died the inquest into his death returned a verdict of unlawful killing its also claimed that in the novichok programme one person was accidentally exposed and died treatment can include the rapid administration of atropine this blocks the effects of acetylcholine accumulation by occupying the same receptors and reverses some symptoms but has little effect on skeletal muscle the rule of thumb is to maintain dosing of atropine at intervals until the heart rate is over beats per minute administration may be necessary for a significant period drugs known as oximes can also be used as an antidote these restore enzyme activity and crucially skeletal muscle function but oximes tend to be specific for certain types of nerve agent and it is unclear which would work with the specific novichok agent as there is little information in the public domain about them or their effective treatments faced with this dilemma the clinicians treating the skripals and bailey would have had to have made a choice a third drug used in nerve agent poisoning is diazepam which can prevent any dangerous convulsions that might occur regrettably however evidence indicates that severe nerve agent poisoning can cause longterm irreversible changes in brain function nerve agents are grotesque weapons and their use against civilians is a deeply disturbing trend but in the weeks to come there will have to be a dispassionate review of the evidence and as the spat between russia and the uk and its allies worsens cool heads will be needed amid all this frenetic activity however we must not forget the three victims and wish them a swift recovery after all they are the ones paying the heaviest price alastair hay is an emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the university of leeds this

landed a major blow against the extremist groups sleek propaganda machine it is the first time the uk has systematically degraded an adversarys online efforts in a military campaign he said the outcomes of these operations are wideranging in there were times when daesh an alternative name for islamic state found it almost impossible to spread their hate online to use their normal channels to spread their rhetoric or trust their publications mr fleming said much of the cyberoperation was too sensitive to talk about but had disrupted the groups online activities and even destroyed equipment and networks this campaign shows how targeted and effective offensive cyber can be he added but mr fleming said the fight against is is not over as the group continues to seek to carry out or inspire further attacks in the uk and find new ungoverned spaces to base their operations advertisement ad theresa may has summoned her cabinet back to london or a meeting today where they will discuss

energy and government sectors which eventually spread across the world or the use of industrial scale disinformation to sway public opinion theyre not playing to the same rules theyre blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity and theyre not alone weve seen statesponsored hackers conducting cyberattacks to avoid sanctions the release of wannacry by north korean cyber actors last year is a good example some of their malware tools are highly complex using extensive infrastructure and advanced tradecraft mr fleming said the challenges facing britain today are vast and the

believes moscow was behind the election meddling despite assessments from us intelligence agencies and the special counsel investigation into russias actions and potential collusion with trumps

an inkling that no explanation was likely to be forthcoming sure enough the deadline came and went and the closest russia has come to a concession is to say via the twitter account of its embassy in the uk that it will only respond once it receives a sample of the chemical substance used in the attack on sergei and yulia skripal moscow continues nevertheless to deny any involvement this has left the prime minister in a sticky if hardly unanticipated situation having made clear that the government believes it is highly likely that the russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination she has been forced to figure out how best to back up her strong words with decisive action the balancing act she must perform is undoubtedly a difficult one and will play out over a

than an instrument of propaganda is nonsense and while the channel does an impressive job of looking professional covering as it does all manner of global events it has been publicly rebuked by the regulator ofcom for misleading viewers about among other things the conflict in eastern ukraine and claims that the bbc staged the use of chemical weapons by the syrian government some rt staff have quit in protest at alleged political interference russian ambassador to the uk says the british government response to salisbury is absolutely unacceptable and we consider this a provocation still if few would doubt that rt is to a greater or lesser degree a tool of the kremlin banning it from broadcasting in the uk would be a mistake in order to end rts uk operations ofcom would have to determine that rt is not fit and proper to hold a broadcasting license this is not as simple as it sounds and would fairly or not allow moscow to raise questions about ofcoms own independence since it would be seen to be acting in response to political pressure that in turn plays into the broader paradox that shutting down a propaganda network will only serve to fuel one of moscows favoured propaganda lines that the west talks the talk about democracy and free media but fails to walk the walk rts average daily reach is only about people across the uk it is not a mainstream channel mps would be quite within their rights to conclude that they are better off not appearing on its shows but any moves to encourage the revocation of rts license would be almost certain to backfire badly in this diplomatic standoff the prime minister cannot afford a false move

said her life had been turned upside down by the assassination attempt but the russian national added she hoped to return to her homeland one day despite the kremlin being blamed for the attack reuters the prime minister went on we know that russia has a record of conducting statesponsored assassinations and that it views some former intelligence officers as legitimate targets for these assassinations and we have information indicating that within the last decade russia has investigated ways of delivering nerve agents probably for assassination and as part of this programme has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks clearly that is in contravention of the chemical weapons convention police offers at the crime scene of the nerveagent attack in sailsbury getty images ms may said no other country besides russia has a combination of the capability the intent and the motive to carry out such an act adding there was no other plausible explanation faced with the evidence we gave the russian government the opportunity to provide an explanation but they did not do so she said they provided no explanation as to why russia has an undeclared chemical weapons programme in contravention of international law no explanation that they could have lost control of their nerve agent and no explanation as to how this agent came to be used in the united kingdom instead they have treated the use of a militarygrade nerve agent in europe with sarcasm contempt and defiance incredibly they have deployed at least different arguments about it police officers stand close to a bench in salisbury where former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were found suffering from extreme exposure to a rare nerve agent epawill oliver epa ms may told mps russia was failing to honour its responsibilities as a permanent member of the un security council she added in particular russia has covered up for the assad regimes use of chemical weapons in syria this has allowed the syrian regime to continue to perpetrate atrocities against syrian people she later said russias behaviour in the western balkans was increasingly aggressive and fitted a pattern of behaviour which sought to foment and sow discord ms may also went on to tell mps her government was calling out russias malign behaviour in cyberspace and said it would also be reinvigorating the bbc russia service as an independent source of news for russian speakers she said the government was cracking down on illicit and corrupt finance and bringing all the capabilities of uk law enforcement to bear against serious criminals and corrupt elites neither of whom have any place in our country jeremy corbyn responds to theresa mays statement to the house of commons on russia pa wire jeremy corbyn the leader of the labour party said russia has failed to answer questions on the outrageous attack carried out in salisbury adding russia has a direct or indirect responsibility for it he told mps based on the analysis conducted by government scientists there can be little doubt that the nerve agent used in this attack was militarygrade novichok of a type manufactured by russia since that analysis was revealed by the prime minister two weeks ago the russian state has had every opportunity to offer a plausible explanation as to how a nerve agent stock of this type came to be used in this attack theyve offered nothing concrete in response except denials and diversion indeed the only solid assertion that theyve offered so far in their defence was that all stocks of nerve agents were destroyed many years ago an assertion that has been contradicted by intelligence reports that suggests that just over a decade ago russia invested in the use of nerve agents and developed new stockpiles of novichok to that end there is clear evidence that the russian state has a case to answer and that theyve failed to do so and we can therefore draw no other conclusion other than russia has a direct or indirect responsibility for this

https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201803181062655572-skripal-investigation-litvinenko-dunkerley/,733,478,sputnik what do you think of the actual nerve agent that was used which is known as novichok what have you heard so far and what are your thoughts about possible origins of this agent william dunkerley it sounds like the same old story again that was put forth about the polonium and litvinenkos case where people said it was from russia and it could be traced back to a specific place although there were subsequent expert testimonies that that was in fact not even possible i saw recently a new york times story that said the united states was cooperating with uzbekistan in closing down the plant that had manufactured the substance and destroying the stockpile so if you look at the chain of custody of the alleged chemical agent it looks like the united states may have been one of the last parties to be involved read more i think skripal attempted murder staged by us uk intel political scientist sputnik this is a nerve agent which can be produced at a standard chemical plant that produces fertilizer or chemical pesticides and the people working in these factories dont even realize that theyre working to make a chemical weapon because it is in fact a binary product which until the two substances are mixed in certain proportions doesnt present the threat that it does when it is mixed william dunkerley that goes even further to the point that it really is not possible to trace the origin of the poison that was used on skripal sputnik do you think that the case of litvinenko has affected the way the british are dealing with the skripal case william dunkerley in a lot of ways its the same pattern recently the foreign minister in russia said that the cases are entirely different because the british side was putting out the word heres another assassination by putin on british territory certainly there are differences between the two cases but theres one thing that is almost exactly the same it is that both cases are based on hearsay information and lack factual bases in that regard theyre the same read more may heckler demands clear evidence russia behind skripal poisoning sputnik but in the case of litvinenko theres a huge study it was one of the most thorough investigations that was conducted by the british sir robert owen was in charge of that although he came to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence heard in open court to build a strong circumstantial case against the russian state do you see any parallels between the two cases many people criticized britain for giving an inadequate response to the litvinenko case do you think that theyre compensating for that now william dunkerley the litvinenko case as far as the public description of what happened was a hoax in my view there was no factual basis the coroners inquest didnt start until around five years after his death and before the inquest opened the british prosecutor ken macdonald had said that he had grave suspicions there was russian state involvement grave suspicions is a long way from having a case so i dont think that anything that transpired with robert owens inquest or inquiry has any legitimacy he was definitely on a witch hunt looking for russian state involvement i was involved with an effort to get that witch hunt called off and had probably interactions between me and the chancellors office chris grayling and then home secretary theresa may and ultimately got them to come along with the view that i had taken about the case that owen was conducting a witch hunt that he wasnt authorized to do theresa may reprimanded owen for that in the end and subsequently owen agreed to remove the search for russian culpability from the scope of his inquest that happened at the end of mr dunkerley is recognized internationally for his research and publications about the alexander litvinenko polonium poisoning

this is the story of a town called douma a ravaged stinking place of smashed apartment blocks and of an underground clinic whose images of suffering allowed three of the western worlds most powerful nations to bomb syria last week theres even a friendly doctor in a green coat who when i track him down in the very same clinic cheerfully tells me that the gas videotape which horrified the world despite all the doubters is perfectly genuine war stories however have a habit of growing darker for the same year old senior syrian doctor then adds something profoundly uncomfortable the patients he says were overcome not by gas but by oxygen starvation in the rubbishfilled tunnels and basements in which they lived on a night of wind and heavy shelling that stirred up a dust storm as dr assim rahaibani announces this extraordinary conclusion it is worth observing that he is by his own admission not an eyewitness himself and as he speaks good english he refers twice to the jihadi gunmen of jaish elislam the army of islam in douma as terrorists the regimes word for their enemies and a term used by many people across syria am i hearing this right which version of events are we to believe by bad luck too the doctors who were on duty that night on april were all in damascus giving evidence to a chemical weapons enquiry which will be attempting to provide a definitive answer to that question in the coming weeks france meanwhile has said it has proof chemical weapons were used and us media have quoted sources saying urine and blood tests showed this too the who has said its partners on the ground treated patients exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals at the same time inspectors from the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw are currently blocked from coming here to the site of the alleged gas attack themselves ostensibly because they lacked the correct un permits before we go any further readers should be aware that this is not the only story in douma there are the many people i talked to amid the ruins of the town who said they had never believed in gas stories which were usually put about they claimed by the armed islamist groups these particular jihadis survived under a blizzard of shellfire by living in others peoples homes and in vast wide tunnels with underground roads carved through the living rock by prisoners with pickaxes on three levels beneath the town i walked through three of them yesterday vast corridors of living rock which still contained russian yes russian rockets and

just a story of gas or no gas as the case may be its about thousands of people who did not opt for evacuation from douma on buses that left last week alongside the gunmen with whom they had to live like troglodytes for months in order to survive i walked across this town quite freely yesterday without soldier policeman or minder to haunt my footsteps just two syrian friends a camera and a notebook i sometimes had to clamber across foothigh ramparts up and down almost sheer walls of earth happy to see foreigners among them happier still that the siege is finally over they are mostly smiling those whose faces you can see of course because a surprising number of doumas women wear fulllength black hijab rubble fills a street in douma the site of a suspected chemical weapons attack near damascus ap i first drove into douma as part of an escorted convoy of journalists but once a boring general had announced outside a wrecked council house i have no information that most helpful rubbishdump of arab officialdom i just walked away several other reporters mostly syrian did the same even a group of russian journalists all in military attire drifted off it was a short walk to dr rahaibani from the door of his subterranean clinic point it is called in the weird geology of this partlyunderground city is a corridor leading downhill where he showed me his lowly hospital and the few beds where a small girl was crying as nurses treated a cut above her eye i was with my family in the basement of my home three hundred metres from here on the night but all the doctors know what happened there was a lot of shelling by government forces and aircraft were always over douma at night but on this night there was wind and huge dust clouds began to come into the basements and cellars where people lived people began to arrive here suffering from hypoxia oxygen loss then someone at the door a white helmet shouted gas and a panic began people started throwing water over each other yes the video was filmed here it is genuine but what you see are people suffering from hypoxia not gas poisoning independent middle east correspondent robert fisk in one of the miles of tunnels hacked beneath douma by prisoners of syrian rebels yara ismail oddly after chatting to more than people i couldnt find one who showed the slightest interest in doumas role in bringing about the western air attacks two actually told me they didnt know about the connection but it was a strange world i walked into two men hussam and nazir abu aishe said they were unaware how many people had been killed in douma although the latter admitted he had a cousin executed by jaish elislam the army of islam for allegedly being close to the regime they shrugged when i asked about the people said to have died in the infamous douma attack the white helmets the medical first responders already legendary in the west but with some interesting corners to their own story played a familiar role during the battles they are partly funded by the foreign office and most of the local offices were staffed by douma men i found their wrecked offices not far from dr rahaibanis clinic a gas mask had been left outside a food container with one eyepiece pierced and a pile of dirty military camouflage uniforms lay inside one room planted i asked myself i doubt it the place was heaped with capsules broken medical equipment and files bedding and mattresses of course we must hear their side of the story but it will not happen here a woman told us that every member of the white helmets in douma

ruthless dictatorship but that couldnt cow these people happy to see foreigners among them from reacting with a few words of truth so what were they telling me they talked about the islamists under

the massive buildings inside the security zones they created had almost all been sandwiched to the ground by air strikes a syrian colonel i came across behind one of these buildings asked if i wanted

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/18/opcw-rejects-russian-claims-of-second-salisbury-nerve-agent,746,562,senior figures from the global chemical weapons watchdog have flatly rejected russian claims that the watchdogs laboratories had found a western military chemical agent in the poison that incapacitated the russian double agent sergei skripal in a weekend claim widely picked up on social media the russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that a swiss laboratory used by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons had discovered traces in the sample of the nerve agent bz and its precursors the nerve agent is possessed by nato countries but not russia the russian embassy in london said it was highly likely that bz had therefore been used in salisbury adding that the opcw and the british had questions to answer but at a meeting of the opcw executive in the hague the russian claim was refuted by opcw officials who said explained that bz had been used in the control sample not the sample itself it is also a breach of opcw procedures to identify a laboratory involved in a test the uk said russia had been caught out in an attempt to mislead the international community adding the opcw report showed the world was facing a clear case of a new family of toxic chemicals intended to kill the west also bluntly criticised russia for generally endangering the integrity and respect for opcw scientists in a bid to clear itself of the allegation that it was behind the use of a nerve agent that poisoned skripal and his daughter yulia in salisbury last month the swiss delegation described lavrovs behaviour as incomprehensible and totally unacceptable sabine nölke the canadian envoy to the opcw accused russia of either a craven attempt to mislead the international community or a breach of the opcws confidentiality procedures the eu described the russian behaviour as malign the opcw meeting had been called by the uk to discuss an opcw technical report completed last week confirming that the uks porton down laboratories had correctly identified the nerve agent as novichok the uk continued to assert that only russia had the motive technical ability and operational experience to produce the agent the opcw is not empowered to identify the source of the nerve agent but russian media claimed the opcws refusal to identify russia as a source was a vindication for the kremlin referring to lavrovs claims about the discovery of bz marcmichael blum the head of the opcw laboratory told the meeting the labs were able to confirm the identity of the chemical by applying existing wellestablished procedures there was no other chemical that was identified by the labs the precursor of bz that is referred to in the public statements commonly known as q was contained in the control sample prepared by the opcw lab in accordance with the existing quality control procedures otherwise it has nothing to do with the samples collected by the opcw team in salisbury the opcw director general ahmet üzümcü also pushed back against recent russian claims of bias saying its scientists had been able to collect both biomedical and environmental samples under full chain of custody and also splits of earlier samples taken by the british authorities for comparative purposes the opcw analysis clearly confirms the findings of the united kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical used in salisbury that severely injured three people in his presentation the uk opcw envoy pointed out that the opcw noted that the chemical was of high purity indicating that the chemical was not volatile and would degrade slowly all this is cause for grave concern as we now face a clear case of a new family of toxic chemicals intended to kill he said the eu also demanded answers from russia about its responsibilities for a shocking and reprehensible act in its statement it said we regret that we continue to witness persistent and malign russian attempts to undermine the credibility of the opcw secretariat and technical report all this is aimed at hampering and obscuring the investigation in a manner that damages the credibility of the chemical weapons convention russia for its part suggested that the skripals body samples might have been manipulated by british medical experts while in an induced coma

alleged nerve agent attack on a former spy in england dont hold your breath following several years of what some have criticized as the uk governments overlylax policy towards russia experts arent betting on any sweeping measures that would send a groundshaking message to the kremlin over its recent behavior this is in part because of the uks economic ties to moscow as well as divided interests within the european union eu thanks to several countries heavy reliance on russian resources if the kremlin is testing how far it can push the uk and get away with it it may end up pleasantly surprised russia has made clear that it does not see british sanctions as a major threat at this moment max hess political risk analyst at ake group told cnbc on monday he pointed out that as prime minister theresa may announced last week the expulsion of russian diplomats from the uk russias state energy giant gazprom placed million million in bonds through the london market actions over words alarm in europe over the march nerve gas attack on former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter in salisbury deemed by british authorities to have been directed by moscow manifested itself in vocal exclamations of support and solidarity for britain from eu member states russia has denied any involvement calling the accusations fantasy and nonsense but delivering a uniform response beyond words may prove more difficult otilia dhand senior vice president at teneo intelligence spoke to cnbc from brussels about eu leaders deliberations i dont get the feeling that among eu leaders there is a big appetite for additional economic sanctions on russia dhand said in fact this is quite unlikely individual sanctions probably yes targeted sanctions on russian individuals may be forthcoming it is too early to judge how stringently mays government will pursue individuals via mechanisms such as unexplained wealth orders and visa bans but the prime minister has warned there would be more to come however some of the more painful measures that the eu could deploy against russia directed against its broader economy are less likely divided national interests this is because european policies toward moscow are based on the individual interests of member states dhand said some of them are highly dependent on imports of energy from russia some are personally or politically aligned with putin and individual interests of these countries effectively question the cohesion of eu policy on russia a case in point is nord stream an billion project that would ship russian gas across the baltic german chancellor angela merkel has expressed support for the project and germanys foreign minister has suggested easing russian sanctions while poland has called for us sanctions on the pipeline german hopes for the projects success have engendered broadly softer language from the european economic powerhouse toward moscow nord stream pipes are loaded onto a vessel in the northern german port of mukran for transshipment to a storage yard nord stream axel schmidt still dhand added that a postponement of possibly easing sanctions against russia was under discussion meanwhile the most effective individual sanctions she said would be those that targeted members of russian president vladimir putins inner circle domestic politics the uk in limbo domestic politics in the uk could see future action go either way may could be seeing this as an opportunity to show her strength said tim ash senior sovereign strategist at bluebay asset management russian ridicule of the uk and the british establishment likely will have not helped the mood in her majestys government and the likelihood that we see further and significant sanctions iterations so far however moscow was likely relieved that this could have been a lot worse ash said the financial weight of russians in the uk and particularly in london will also be a consideration ukrussia trade in was worth billion and large chunks of the londons professional services industry reliant on highnet worth russian clients will likely lobby against reforms russian president vladimir putin holds a glass of champagne in moscow russia mikhail svetlov getty images the uk cant simply take a policy decision to kick out the oligarchs it can only do so as part of a longer term sustained process said daragh mcdowell principle russia analyst at verisk maplecroft whether the may government will be able to maintain the focus to do so given the other priorities on its plate at the moment is unclear and while such moves would sting some in the kremlin said akes hess it would have a noticeable impact on the uk economy as well and would be risky for the british government to take action calling londons status as the global home of excess capital into question with only a year to go before brexit a weak precedent

powdered version of the agent can take longer to act with symptoms not appearing until as long as hours after exposure advertisement mirzayanov said some novichok variants are binary agents which means they can be stored as two less toxic chemicals that only become hazardous when mixed together one of the main reasons these agents are developed is because their component parts are not on the banned list gary stephens a pharmacology expert at the university of reading told the bbc it means the chemicals that are mixed to create it are much easier to deliver with no risk to the health of the courier novichok is more toxic and more difficult to identify than other nerve agents novichok is believed to be much more toxic than other known nerve agents in his report mirzaryanov said that one variant dubbed novichok was five to eight times as deadly as vx the agent that north korea allegedly used last year to murder kim jong uns halfbrother this is a more dangerous and sophisticated agent than sarin or vx and is harder to identify said stephens media reports suggest uk government is close to finalizing retaliatory measures including diplomatic expulsions and sanctions should a

https://www.yahoo.com/news/skripal-attack-u-k-apos-154627344.html,760,226,there can be little doubt that the russian government is behind the attempted assassination of double agent sergei skripal and his daughter while there were the typical official denials the russian state has ways of communicating its innocence to foreign governments in this case it has not done so the use of a nerve agent fits a pattern established by the murder of alexander litvinenko with polonium in this was not a mcmafiastyle operation commissioned by rogue elements if they were to blame moscow would be even more alarmed than london since the chaos of the s putin has restored the states traditional prerogatives in foreign covert operations as well as the presidents prerogatives within it this was graphically demonstrated in crimea in early with the deployment of little green men but what could be the motive the russians think strategically and will have planned this operation carefully in terms of both its execution and impact what it says to russians living in the uk or those thinking of leaving the country is disloyalty is always punishable you will never be free of us and you will never be safe wherever you live singling out the reclusive year old skripal eight years after he came to the uk and had run out of secrets to tell simply underlines the point you do not have to be an arch enemy of the putin system to be in potential danger and your family may also be a target what it says to the british government led by theresa may is we believe you are weak and we have no respect for you in recent years successive british governments have repeatedly communicated weakness to russia without any intention of doing so first even before the suspicious suicide of dissident oligarch boris berezovsky in the uk authorities had been singularly lackluster in prosecuting a macabre string of suspect deaths of russian exiles on british soil until the government resisted a public inquiry into the death of alexander litvinenko signaling that it was disinclined to name and shame russia for fear of harming attempts to rebuild ties story continues second russia viewed the strategic defense and security review sdsr of as an abdication of britains great power role the winding down of a fair portion of the uks maritime reconnaissance and warfare capability in northern waters was regarded with incredulity the sdsrs successor has repaired much of the damage to uk defense capacities but this scarcely has registered in moscow third david camerons government chose to absent itself from the russiaukraine minsk process leaving the running to paris and berlin given the uks prominent role in securing the rights and assurances that underpinned ukraines independence and territorial integrity including its signature on the budapest memorandum london effectively communicated to moscow that ukraine had become a lesser priority and that britain had better things to do although the uks vigorous defence advisory effort has earned plaudits in kiev russia no longer considers britain to be a serious player in ukraine fourth there is brexit which many of its supporters believe will strengthen britains global influence whatever the merits of that claim the russians view brexit as a case of the uk cutting off its nose to spite its face from the earliest days of the cold war the ussr and its russian successor viewed britain as washingtons number one proxy in europe from moscows perspective the uks position at the eu top table enhanced us and british influence simultaneously that advantage has been thrown away for these reasons the skripal affair is not only a reflection of perceived weakness it is also a test if the uk chooses to act toughly will its allies support it or simply send their best wishes this latest example of russian reconnaissance by combat puts britain into a bind fortunately whatever the allied response the uk is the repository of a national asset of very high value to russia the city of london for many years it has effectively allowed key russian stakeholders to use the services of the city in particular the london stock exchange as well as the highend property market for purposes legitimate illegitimate and even illegal it is time to transform them from a source of advantage to russia to a strategic asset for the uk doing so will require proper analysis coordination including the security services the treasury and the serious fraud office and dedicated resources asset freezes money laundering investigations and selective cancellation of visas for individuals and their families who are either part of the regime or support it will cause real pain in moscow impulsive and symbolic measures will not do the same leon trotsky once said you might not be interested in war but war is interested in you todays russian leadership political and military believes it is at war with the west it is not a war dominated by artillery and tanks but by finance and social media with huge opportunities for covert action from disinformation to assassination as russias ministry of defense stated in to prevail in these new conditions requires destabilizing the society and state and forcing the state to make decisions in the interests of the opposing party that is the test the uk faces this piece was originally published by chatham house

expect them to lose to such an extent that it would endanger theresa mays primeministership on labour lord hayward said mr corbyns huge popularity in big cities masked a poorer performance elsewhere adding for a party in opposition they should be doing far better outside london and on the ongoing turmoil in leaderless ukip he predicted i expect them to disappear almost completely and that to help the tory party in some parts of the country the conservatives won seats in londons last elections four years ago but are expected to lose more than because of labours surge barnet is likely to fall to

out of representation in manchester and liverpool but could snatch a single seat in newcastle the lib dems will hope their antibrexit message will reap rewards in the likes of south cambridgeshire

penalties ordered by donald trump in the wake of the assassination attempt on sergei skripal the us described the diplomats as aggressive russian spies but the white house said the action came in response to russias use of military grade chemical weapons on the soil of the united kingdom the latest in this ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world the expulsions come as the opening salvo in coordinated actions by western nations this morning breaking president trump is ordering the expulsion of russian diplomats and the closure of the russian consulate in seattle due to its proximity to one of our submarine bases pictwittercomcetpebgg cnn march an unnamed administration official laid out the message a little more clearly to nbc the united states on monday announced the expulsion of sixty russian diplomats and intelligence officers as well as the closure of russias seattle consulate in response to the poisoning of exrussian spy sergei skripal on british soil allegedly orchestrated by the kremlin these steps a senior administration official told reporters on condition of anonymity monday morning let the russian government know when you attack our friends you will face serious consequences removing these russians the official said also lessens the unacceptably numerous russian intelligence officers who reside in the united states and spy on americans the actions included the closing of a russian consulate in seattle sarah sanders stated in a written release from the white house that the facility was too close to a us navy submarine base and boeings operations the closing of that facility will no doubt prompt russia to retaliate in kind by closing down a us consulate in their country although we have only three left to close st petersburg vladivostok and yekaterinburg those are already stretched thin to assist russians in getting visas for travel to the us which might make vladimir putin think twice about an outright closure besides putin will have a lot of diplomatic issues to occupy his time eu president donald tusk announced similar expulsions from other nations within the european bloc tusk also warned that more expulsions

italian foreign ministry announced that italy would expel two russian diplomats assigned to the embassy within a week poland germany and lithuania are among the european countries announcing they are expelling russian diplomats over the poisoning of russian exspy in britain germany and poland both say they have asked four russian diplomats to leave while in lithuania three russian diplomats were ordered to leave the skripal assassination and especially its weapon a dangerous sovietera nerve agent appears to have been the last straw this arrogance and recklessness could not possibly have been left without diplomatic and intelligence consequences especially given skripals status as part of an exchange of intelligence assets deploying a weapon of mass destruction in another country is an act of war and the west had an imperative to make russia pay a price for it thats especially true of the us under whose auspices the spy swap took place trumps diplomatic expulsions almost double those of barack obamas for russias attempts to interfere in the election and makes the washingtonmoscow relationship even colder than ever but it was the assassination attempt itself that did the damage russia under putin has always been a malevolent force which trumps two immediate predecessors learned far too late in their administrations trump seems to have learned it earlier perhaps despite himself

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/14/the-uk-sanctions-imposed-on-russia-by-theresa-may,801,597,theresa mays package of diplomatic and economic measures against russia is measured focused but unlikely to put additional economic pressure on either russia or vladimir putins entourage british defence and diplomatic analysts have said jonathan eyal an associate director at the military thinktank rusi said he had expected a stronger reaction there may be an element of seeing whether anything can be saved from the relationship simply blowing everything up to satisfy a media clamour is not the most sensible way of dealing with russia rusis deputy director general malcolm chalmers said none of the measures in themselves will have any impact on russian economic performance mathieu boulègue a russia expert at chatham house another thinktank said the kremlin will understand this as a very mild response putin is unlikely to be worried by this british officials described the package as calibrated calm and fair and said further options were on the table if the kremlin did not change its behaviour diplomats the expulsion of of the accredited russian diplomats is numerically smaller than a similar move by alec douglashome the foreign secretary in ted heaths government in but since then the soviet union has collapsed and the russian embassy in london is now commensurately smaller expelling of the embassy over seven days is very significant and the largest single expulsion in years the decision to allow russias ambassador alexander yakovenko to remain reflects the fact that if he was expelled russia could simply apply to replace him any decapitation of the russian embassy would only lead to reprisals in the uk and the uk still needs an interlocutor on syria even if many of the discussions on this occur at the un all embassies are a mix of commercial political and military attaches but it is surprising that the uk believes that as many as of russian embassy staff were involved in intelligence the foreign office said they will not be replaced for the foreseeable future so crippling the russian operation closer monitoring of individuals chalmers said longterm measures such as greater monitoring of private jets and freight alongside new powers to stop people on borders were an implicit admission that the intelligence services have been focused on counterterrorism as opposed to state threats notably from russia financial crackdown may stressed that there was no desire to target russians in the uk and the scale of the financial measures is limited neither the government nor independent experts regard a british version of the magnitsky act now to be inserted in the sanctions bill at commons report stage as likely to change the governments investigatory or judicial powers the measures underline the power to freeze assets and impose visa bans chalmers argued that unexplained wealth orders a new tool that came into force this year and has been used only twice on nonrussian citizens may be more productive in helping the national crime agency to lift the lid on money laundering and organised crime there are dangers that someone subject to magnitsky actstyle legislation could demand to see the intelligence material on which any prosecution was based it was noticeable that no individuals were named by may on wednesday sir vince cable the liberal democrat leader raised the delay in the establishment of a public register of beneficial share owners an idea first set out during david camerons g chairmanship in sport as expected the boycott of the world cup is limited to ministers and members of the royal family intelligenceled cooperation about possible clashes between russian and english football hooligans must now be in question media freedom ofcom the media regulator acting independently of the government has already announced that it will investigate whether the russian broadcaster rts licence should be revoked on publicinterest grounds the foreign office is running a global campaign promoting press freedom and a stateengineered shutdown of russian media outlets in the uk would leave ministers open to charges of hypocrisy by countries such as turkey chemical weapons russian ministers insist that russia destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles last year and have said the sovietdesigned nerve agent novichok which britain said was used to poison the former spy sergei skripal was not part of an international ban on chemical weapons the uk will now press the international forums to demand that russia come clean on its stockpiles multilateral action the uk is using its convening powers to the full at the un the eu and nato but may in her statement was careful not to make any specific demands of other world leaders rusis eyal said perhaps we did not ask because refusal often offends pointing out that france and germany are keen to open dialogues with putin chalmers said the statements of solidarity from uk allies were robust apart from the trump wobble but added it will be much harder for other states to take the same concrete steps as the uk such as cutting off diplomatic ties the french president emmanuel macron for instance will not cancel a state visit to moscow in the late spring alongside an army of french businessmen but eyal said the true litmus test will be the maintenance of existing eu sanctions officials admit the practical support the uk will gather in the months ahead will depend in part on convincing its partners that russia rather than an unknown nonstate actor was responsible for the attack the scepticism of the labour opposition hardly discourages scepticism in europe chalmers said that despite russian declarations that it had destroyed all its chemical weapons there were longstanding suspicions that it had held some back by contrast there is no reporting that other exsoviet states have retained stockpiles of chemical weapons and are all signatories to the chemical weapons convention eyal dismissed the notion that the attack could have been mounted by a rogue element in the russian elite the implications of this baroque attack and the chances of being caught were so high and the target of the assassination so low that it is inconceivable that someone in moscow would undertake this operation risking the anger of putin without having authority

retaliatory measures it would take to the ejecting of russian diplomats from the uk the russian response may now be delayed until next week as moscow seeks to avoid drawing attention away from its impending election on friday boris johnson made the incendiary claim that it was overwhelmingly likely mr putin personally ordered the assassination attempt on sergei skripal using a sovietera nerve agent an attack which left both him and his daughter yulia in a critical condition in hospital the foreign secretarys comments which appeared designed to show that britain bears no ill will towards ordinary russians was denounced by moscow as an unforgivable breach of diplomatic etiquette mr johnson had been speaking during a visit to the battle of britain bunker museum in uxbridge with his polish counterpart jacek czaputowicz mr johnson said our quarrel is with putins kremlin and with his decision and we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the uk on the streets of europe for the first time since the second world war that is why we are at odds with russia dmitry peskov russian presidential press secretary told the staterun tass news agency we have already said on many levels that russia has nothing to do with this story whatsoever any reference or mention of our president in this connection is nothing but a shocking and unforgivable violation of the diplomatic rules of propriety the uk government has said it is highly likely that russia was behind the attack which used the military grade nerve agent novichok but until now has not directly suggested mr putin was personally responsible mr peskov said it had become obvious that there is a lack of any clear proof of russian involvement referring to a joint statement of support from britains allies he said the whole wave of such statements originated from britain russia has refused to explain how novichok was used to strike down the skripals this month they were found unconscious on a bench and remain critically ill in hospital the country has demanded access to the case and opened its own investigation into the attempted murders

london embassy but there has as yet been no other signal as to how moscow will deal with the rest of the package announced by theresa may on wednesday this included the promise to step up sanctions a threat to freeze hostile russian state assets and a wider intention to work against suspicious russian money in the uk mr peskov said the kremlin had been surprised by the british governments actions we havent seen this type of behaviour on a state level before he told journalists delivering serious accusations against russia on a highly likely basis is both against international law and common sense mr johnsons comments came as russia was only just responding to the assertion from the foreign secretarys colleague the defence secretary gavin williamson that russia should go away it should shut up sergei lavrov said the comments suggested mr williamson lacked education well hes a nice man im told maybe he wants to claim a place in history by making some bold statements mr lavrov said

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/15/corbyn-defies-critics-calls-for-calm-over-russia-nerve-agent-attack,803,534,jeremy corbyn has defied critics in his own party and warned the prime minister against rushing way ahead of the evidence over the salisbury poisoning in what he called the fevered atmosphere of westminster the labour leader used an article in the guardian to urge the government to take a calm measured approach and warn against the drift towards a new cold war with russia corbyn was criticised by some in his own party on wednesday for what they regarded as his lacklustre response to theresa mays announcement of action against moscow over the poisoning of former spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia with a nerve agent the labour leader doubled down on that cautious approach on thursday night this horrific event demands first of all the most thorough and painstaking criminal investigation conducted by our police and security services he said to rush way ahead of the evidence being gathered by the police in a fevered parliamentary atmosphere serves neither justice nor our national security corbyn warned against a mccarthyite intolerance of dissent over russia labour is of course no supporter of the putin regime its conservative authoritarianism abuse of human rights or political and economic corruption he said however that does not mean we should resign ourselves to a new cold war of escalating arms spending proxy conflicts across the globe and a mccarthyite intolerance of dissent they have just one week to leave may expels russian diplomats video corbyn backed mays decision to expel diplomats but suggested a financial crackdown on russian oligarchs would be more effective we agree with the governments action in relation to russian diplomats but measures to tackle the oligarchs and their loot would have a far greater impact on russias elite than limited titfortat expulsions he said the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell also pledged to hammer moneylaundering saying that would be a more effective weapon against vladimir putins regime than expelling diplomats he claimed labour would be tougher on the putin regime than the government by starving gangster politicians of cash outlining anti moneylaundering measures designed to stop the channelling of stolen money through the city and tax havens under uk jurisdiction however despite mcdonnells tough stance corbyns remarks are likely to reignite tensions in the parliamentary labour party over the leaderships tough response to the russia crisis nineteen labour mps have signed an early day motion tabled by barrow mp john woodcock a longtime corbyn critic putting on the record their full backing for may and the measures she announced some shadow cabinet members appeared to take a different stance with emily thornberry insisting russia had a prima facie case to answer to which it had offered no defence the shadow defence secretary nia griffith publicly questioned the connection drawn by corbyns spokesman between intelligence in the salisbury case and the dodgy dossier that helped make the case for the iraq war i think the two situations are very different she told the bbcs today programme but the corbyns article made that link explicitly there can and should be the basis for a common political response to this crime but in my years in parliament i have seen clear thinking in an international crisis overwhelmed by emotion and hasty judgments too many times flawed intelligence and dodgy dossiers led to the calamity of the iraq invasion there was overwhelming bipartisan support for attacking libya but it proved to be wrong a universal repugnance at the attacks led to a war on afghanistan which continues to this day while terrorism has spread across the globe the guardian understands neither griffith nor thornberry were shown the article in advance they had been reassured by an interview corbyn gave earlier on thursday in which he said that evidence points towards russia corbyns allies have leapt to his defence with the brighton kemptown mp lloyd russellmoyle tweeting that the labour leaders detractors were rightwing sods who want to beat the drums of war without a clear plan woodcock said there is much in this piece which is troubling not least the strange reference to mccarthyism jeremy corbyn is not a powerless victim he is a man who seeks to lead our country at a time when it has been shown to be under significant threat mcdonnell said he had been urging tougher action against money laundering in the city and britains overseas territories but had been repeatedly rebuffed by the government six labour amendments to the sanctions and money laundering bill had been opposed by the tories in the past two weeks he added i will be tougher on russian money than the government and clearer about how to do it mcdonnell said the shadow chancellor said that would involve tightening the definition of a politically exposed person someone in a public position viewed as being at higher risk of bribery and corruption to include a wider range of people close to putin you can send diplomats back you can

https://sputniknews.com/europe/201803231062813438-european-leaders-russia-skripal-poisoning/,805,181,eu president donald tusk said in a tweet thursday that the euco agrees with uk government and that there is no other plausible explanation officials have also agreed to recall the blocs ambassador to moscow for consultations we decided to take home the eu ambassador to russia the eu councils press office said in a statement that quoted swedish prime minister stefan lofven head of state meanwhile a source familiar with the matter confirmed to sputnik that several eu nations were considering recalling their diplomats from russia of expelling russian diplomats over the poisoning scandal
https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201803151062564960-skripal-poisoning-uk-russia/,807,534,by all accounts thereafter mr skripal lived the tranquil life of a russian émigré settling in the quaint cathedral city of salisbury in wiltshire southern england he did so openly under his real name and not an assumed identity this suggests that he did not consider himself to be in danger of retribution or harm by the russian state there have been reports that he gave lectures on the gru at various military academies one assumes that he did so in return for a fee as to other sources of income he may have received while living in exile in the uk whether he was in receipt of a pension or some stipend or other from the state no information in this regard has yet come to light when it comes to russias possible motive in seeking his assassination this is hard to conjure with with no information to suggest mr skripal was engaged in activities that could be construed as a threat to russia or its national security what possible benefit could attain to moscow with this attack more pertinently using the nerve agent novichok to try and kill him would have been to leave a signature as prominent and as obvious as a flashing neon light in the form of an arrow pointing in the direction of the kremlin this is not to suggest that russia is not capable of carrying out an attack of this nature all governments and their intelligence agencies are capable of such attacks indeed most certainly have carried them out including britains intelligence agencies to argue otherwise is to reveal a level of naivety that is incompatible with the real world read more lavrov on skripal case russia to expel uk diplomats in response so no it is not a question of whether russia is capable or willing to carry out an attack of this nature it is a question of whether russia would be stupid or reckless enough to carry out this specific attack factoring in the lack of any apparent threat posed to russia by mr skripal the crudity of the method employed and how it placed the lives of innocent civilians at risk along with the severe and significant reputational damage moscow would deservedly suffer across the world in the event it doesnt make sense this being said the rush to judgment on the part of the mainstream press in the uk along with the government and near entire uk political class has been frightening to behold it reveals that no lessons have been learned from the march to war in iraq in when as with now we had an establishment commentariat issuing pugnacious and ferocious demands for action to be taken in this instance against iraq and its government over claims it possessed stockpiles of wmd that could be weaponized and unleashed against british targets in cyprus within minutes then as now the media clamour for action on the basis of what later came to light was fabricated intelligence was used by the blair government to forge a near ironclad consensus among mps on all sides of the house house of commons that military action in conjunction with the us was both necessary and justified the tragic and grievous result of this military we now know and yet despite this ineradicable stain on the record of british foreign policy leader of the opposition jeremy corbyn for daring to question the governments assertion that russia was responsible for this crime has been subjected to what can accurately be described as dogs abuse reviled as an appeaser of putins aggression and derided as weak lacking the necessary and required understanding of the threat russia poses to britain regardless and moving on here is where we get to the nittygritty in september the opcw organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons issued a statement marking the completion of the full destruction of the metric tons of chemical weapons possessed by the russian federation the statement authored by opcw directorgeneral ahmet üzümcü continues the completion of the verified destruction of russias chemical weapons programme is a major milestone in the achievement of the goals of the chemical weapons convention i congratulate russia and i commend all of their experts who were involved for their professionalism and dedication watch cctv footage of skripal right before he was found poisoned the opcw by way of a reminder is the internationally recognized body charged with implementing the provisions of said chemical weapons convention which was established in the significance of the opcw statement from september could not be clearer it contradicts theresa mays assertion that the kremlin is the perpetrator of the skripal attack and it means that the british government is inferring that the opcw was either mistaken when it confirmed that the russian federation had disposed of its entire stock of chemical weapons in or that it was peddling an untruth a third explanation of course is that the credibility of the opcw has been and is being wilfully undermined in service to a geopolitical agenda en passant it should be noted that at this writing britain has yet to provide a sample of the novichok nerve agent we have been told was used in the attack on mr skripal and his daughter to either the russian authorities or the opcw for testing it should also be borne in mind that under article ix clause of the chemical weapons convention a state party which receives a request from another state party for clarification of any matter which the requesting state party believes causes such a doubt or concern shall provide the requesting state party as soon as possible but in any case not later than days after the request rather than the ten days provided for under the convention the russian government was given an ultimatum of hours by theresa mays government in her initial statement to the house on the skripal case on march may confirmed that the investigation by the british authorities was ongoing but that it was highly likely russia was responsible bearing in mind the magnitude of this issue what it portends for already parlous relations between moscow and london a verdict of highly likely is problematic to say the least in her subsequent statement to the house two days later on march providing an update on the case and laying out an array of punitive measures her government had decided to respond with against russia up to and including the expulsion from the uk of russian diplomats the prime minister asserted there were only two plausible explanations either this was a direct act by the russian state against our country she went on or conceivably the russian government could have lost control of a militarygrade nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others the word plausible in her statement is crucial it is of a piece with highly likely in her original statement their usage is no accident it exposes the fact that thus far the british government is unable to assert beyond reasonable doubt that to coin a phrase russia did it thus skepticism at this stage is not only justified it is absolutely mandatory whether this feral uk political and media establishment likes it or not the ghost of iraq in hangs like an incubus over this entire issue it reminds us of the folly of taking at face value the bald assertions of those in power in matters of war and peace read more nato doesnt want new cold war arms race with russia stoltenberg i say war and peace because the antirussia invective that has been loosed upon the british people since the attack on mr skripal and his daughter has been of the thcentury variety indeed the antirussia rhetoric that weve been regaled with has been of such intensity it is no exaggeration to state that it would have propelled the brave men of the countrys legendary light brigade who rode into history at the battle of balaclava in to even greater heights of glory than they actually achieved for the more discerning alarm bells have been set ringing over the course of these proceedings as of now no compelling or conclusive evidence has been produced to suggest that russia was responsible for this heinous crime in salisbury as of now there are more questions than answers as of now the entire thing stinks if or when that changes ill let you know the views and opinions expressed by john wight are

called the poisoning of an exrussian spy and his daughter with a militarygrade nerve agent in the uk a really egregious act that appears to have clearly come from russia on his way back from a trip to africa tillerson said late monday that it was not yet known whether the poisoning came from russia with the russian governments knowledge the comments came before president donald trump announced tuesday morning that cia director mike pompeo would replace tillerson secretary of state rex tillerson jonathan ernst afp getty images trump said he would speak with british prime minister theresa may on tuesday about the poisoning as soon as we get the facts straight if we agree with them we will condemn russia or whoever it may be he said in a statement released by the state department on monday evening tillerson called russia an irresponsible force of instability in the world acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens tillersons remarks echoed those of may who had said monday that it is highly likely russia is responsible for the poisoning either directly or because it lost control of the nerve agent may gave russia a deadline of midnight tuesday to explain how sergei skripal a former russian military intelligence officer and onetime double agent for britain and his daughter yulia were poisoned however russias foreign minister sergey lavrov suggested on tuesday that russia would cooperate with britain only if it gets access to the nerve agent so it could carry out its own analysis britain has thus far denied its requests he said adding that russia was not to blame for the poisoning tillerson also expressed bewilderment that another country would deliberately target people in public using a dangerous substance in a foreign country its almost beyond comprehension that a state an organized state would do something like that he said while traveling aboard a us airplane during a trip to africa a nonstate actor i could understand a state actor i cannot understand why anyone would take such an action he said asked if the poisoning will trigger a mutual defense response with the close nato ally tillerson said that it certainly will trigger a response ill leave it at that the european union also said it would stand by britain which is due to leave the bloc in just over a years time may spoke to french president emmanuel macron who downing street said condemned the attack and offered his solidarity with britain tillerson who spoke monday by phone with british foreign secretary boris johnson said hes become extremely concerned about russia noting that he spent most of the first year of the trump administration trying to solve problems and narrow differences with the kremlin he said after a year of trying we didnt get very far instead what weve seen is a pivot on their part to be more aggressive tillerson added the comments mirrored those of johnson who said tuesday that conversations with the

be the first time that a nerve agent has been used in europe since the end of world war ii johnson said skripal and his daughter remain in critical condition more than a week after they were found unconscious in salisbury on march a british police officer who was one of the first to attend to the stricken spy was also affected by the nerve agent he remains in serious condition officials said skripal was a russian military intelligence officer before flipping to the british side in the s going to jail in russia in and being freed in an exchange of spies in the case has similarities to the killing of former russian spy alexander litvinenko who was poisoned with radioactive tea in london in a british inquiry concluded that his death was the work of the russian state and had probably been authorized by russian president vladimir putin british home secretary amber rudd said tuesday afternoon that police and the security services would investigate allegations of russian state involvement in a number of other deaths in recent years in britain a letter published on tuesday showed reuters reported on tuesday morning putin responded to a question by a bbc reporter asking if russia was

https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/12/17109266/russia-spy-skripal-nerve-agent-salisbury-theresa-may-novichok,819,606,uk prime minister theresa may said her country will expel russian diplomats on wednesday which would be the countrys largest removal of foreign officials in more than years heres why on march sergei skripal a former soviet and russian spy was found unconscious on a bench alongside his daughter yulia according to may they were poisoned with a nerve agent known as novichok in salisbury southern england where he lives both skripal and his daughter are still in the hospital and are reportedly in dire condition novichok is part of a group of nerve agents considered to be the most lethal in the world and the russian government has been producing it for decades two days ago may said it was highly likely russia was behind the mysterious chemical attack and requested that the country help her government understand exactly what happened but it appears russia didnt comply with her request and now she says there is no alternative conclusion other than that the russian state was culpable for the attempted murder of mr skripal and his daughter and for threatening the lives of other british citizens may also suspended all highlevel contact between the uk and russia with no indication of when they will resume again even before mays announcement experts i spoke to thought moscow was at fault this is a classic kremlin playbook move rachel rizzo a european security expert at the center for a new american security think tank told me on monday moscow denies any involvement in the attack and said any effort to remove russian diplomats from london would be met with a serious response the british side should be aware of that the russian embassy in the uk tweeted in a separate tweet the embassy relayed a statement from kremlin spokesperson dmitri peskov where he took a shot at british media for fingering moscow for the attack kremlin spox peskov russia having nothing to do with sergei skripal poisoning is ready to cooperate with uk but sees no reciprocity uk media proved their quality no more trust in them pictwittercomymfgtl russian embassy uk march but russia has a history of targeting people in the uk that the russian government believes are enemies of the state and it looks like that just happened again who is sergei skripal skripal may be one of the most important turncoats youve never heard of he was a member of a russian intelligence service known as the gru who was convicted in of handing over the names of russian agents to the british skripal admitted to helping uk spies for at least a decade but in the us and russia swapped the largest number of spies since the end of the cold war and skripal was among them he then settled into a fairly modest life in a salisbury culdesac some unconfirmed reports suggest skripal received official warnings that his life was in danger before the march attack but he apparently changed nothing about his lifestyle other unconfirmed reports say skripal had a large amount of money in his bank account and that there are phone records connecting him to a british spy in estonia perhaps the agent that recruited him to work for the uk its unclear if skripal ever spoke out against putin or the russian government and its especially unclear why russia would target him now but evelyn farkas a former top pentagon official focused on russia thinks skripal may have been on a russian list for some time this looks to me like hes on a list of former spies and former kremlin cronies who moscow likes to eliminate as a sign that you have to stay loyal that list sadly is seemingly quite long weve seen this happen before and well see it happen again the attack on skripal isnt an isolated incident russia has a longstanding campaign to identify and kill russian dissidents living in the uk us intelligence links at least deaths in the uk to russia including outspoken oligarchs and journalists we know the russians have an active program of killing people in the uk that they dont like a british intelligence officer told steven hall a former cia official focused on russia according to buzzfeed news the skripal case has already drawn comparisons to one of those murders that of alexander litvinenko a former russian spy and defector to the uk in two russian agents put polonium a highly radioactive chemical in litvinenkos tea at a london hotel bar it took weeks for litvinenko to die and he blamed putin for orchestrating the attack you may succeed in silencing one man litvinenko said from his hospital bed but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate mr putin in your ears for the rest of your life russia continues to deny any involvement in litvinenkos death there are other cases as well in boris berezovsky then a russian oligarch died on a bathroom floor in his home outside london berezovsky was a putin critic at one point he called for a coup against putin who blamed the kremlin for litvinenkos death berezovsky eventually tried to go back to russia but he died before putin granted his request to return that in part is why analysts suspected russia from the start weve seen this happen before and well see it happen again rizzo told me on monday the question is what does the west do about it

that still dominates its streets opinions to start the day in your inbox sign up arrowright so you can imagine britains sense of revulsion indeed of violation over the fact that a tranquil medieval city has witnessed the first offensive use of a nerve agent in europe since world war ii as i write the principal target sergei skripal and his daughter yulia are both in critical condition a police officer who went to their aid is also in the hospital about three dozen others required medical treatment simply because they were nearby when the substance was released the us has joined european allies in condemning a nerve agent attack likely carried out by russia opinion writers discuss on its only thursday video the washington post it was only down to chance that more people are not lying stricken today the perpetrators clearly did not care how many innocents were endangered what sticks in my mind is the cavalier indifference and sheer brazenness of this attack advertisement our experts have identified the weapon used in salisbury on march as a fourthgeneration nerve agent known as novichok designed to play havoc with the central nervous system and inflict a lingering death russian scientists developed novichok starting in the s today only russia combines a record of statesponsored assassinations with a publicly avowed motive for trying to kill sergei skripal and stockpiles of novichok agents on monday i summoned the russian ambassador and gave his government hours to inform us if any of these stocks had somehow gone missing i regret to say that the deadline passed without a response from the kremlin the british government has drawn the only plausible conclusion that the russian state attempted murder in a british city employing a lethal nerve agent banned under the chemical weapons convention advertisement on wednesday theresa may the prime minister announced the biggest expulsion of russian diplomats from britain for more than years evicting undeclared intelligence officers the government will now take a range of measures to protect britain from hostile states and dismantle the russian espionage network in our country but this matter goes far beyond a bilateral dispute if the russian state is prepared to deploy a banned weapon in a british city amounting to the unlawful use of force against the united kingdom then the kremlin is clearly willing to act without restraint the bleak truth is that what happened in salisbury could have happened anywhere i interpret this incident as part of a pattern of reckless behavior by president vladimir putin the common thread that joins the poisonings in salisbury with the annexation of crimea the cyberattacks in ukraine the hacking of germanys parliament and russian interference in foreign elections is the kremlins reckless defiance of essential international rules advertisement most tellingly of all russia has made immense efforts to conceal the use of chemical weapons by the assad regime in syria in october an international investigation concluded that bashar alassads forces had used the nerve agent sarin against the town of khan sheikhoun in april yet instead of condemning assad russia covered up for him by vetoing the renewal of the international inquiry and in effect forcing it to shut down how much easier does it become for a state to deploy chemical weapons when its government has already tolerated and sought to hide their use by others i would draw a connection between putins indulgence of assads atrocities in syria and the russian states evident willingness to employ a chemical weapon on british soil there is a reason for choosing novichok in its blatant russianness the nerve agent sends a signal to all who may be thinking of dissent in the intensifying repression of putins russia the message is clear we will find you we will catch you we will kill you and though we will deny it with lipcurling scorn the world will know beyond doubt that russia did it advertisement as a permanent member of the un security council russia has a special obligation to uphold the rules of good international conduct when it does the opposite and tramples upon these rules the kremlin threatens the very architecture of global security all responsible nations share an obligation to take a principled stance against this behavior the countermeasures announced by the prime minister are not solely about the attack in salisbury britain is striving to uphold the rules on which the safety of every country depends i hope and believe

poisoning clearly came from russia novichok he added is a militarygrade agent found only in the hands of a very very limited number of parties heres what we know about the agent and why its been described as definitely russian novichok was developed in the soviet union in the s the name novichok which means newcomer in russian applies to a group of militarygrade nerve agents that the soviet union developed in the s a senior soviet chemist and whistleblower vil mirzayanov revealed the agents existence in the mids in a report he cowrote for the stimson center mirzayanov described how the chemicals were developed at the state scientific research institute of organic chemistry and technology in moscow during the final years of the cold war at the time the us and the soviet union were making public pledges to dismantle their existing stockpiles of chemical weapons novichok mirzayanov said was developed in secret and designed to be undetectable to inspectors according to npr novichok is made with organophosphates commercially available chemicals that are used in fertilizers and pesticides they possess a different chemical structure to some other nerve agents though their effect on the human body is said to be the same investigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in winterslow near salisbury as police and members of the armed forces continue to

novichok like other nerve agents work by blocking messages from the nervous system to the muscles the reason you die from these chemicals is very simple dr lewis nelson chairman of emergency medicine at rutgers new jersey medical school told livescience if your muscles dont work you cant breathe and if you cant breathe you eventually die story continues the effects of novichok poisoning on the human body can be almost immediate with symptoms appearing as quickly as seconds to minutes following exposure symptoms of novichok poisoning include constricted pupils convulsions drooling and in serious cases coma respiratory failure and possibly death what to do if youre exposed if a person is exposed to novichok their clothing should be removed their eyes rinsed out and their skin washed with soap and water oxygen should also be administered british health authorities said on sunday offered guidance to anyone who was in the area where sergei skripal the yearold former russian spy and his yearold daughter yulia skripal were found incapacitated recommendations include washing ones clothes and cleaning ones phone using baby wipes while there is no immediate health risk to anyone who may have been in either of these locations it is possible but unlikely that any of the substance which has come into contact with clothing or belongings could still be present in minute amounts and therefore contaminate your skin officials said over time repeated skin contact with contaminated items may pose a small risk to health a police car being taken away by military personnel from college street car park in salisbury as police and members of the armed forces probe the nerve agent attack on sergei skripal photo andrew matthews pa images via getty images the agent can take on a variety of forms novichok can exist as both a liquid and also a powder according to the bbc a powdered version of the agent can take longer to act with symptoms not appearing until as long as hours after exposure mirzayanov said some novichok variants are binary agents which means they can be stored as two less toxic chemicals that only become hazardous when mixed together one of the main reasons these agents are developed is because their component parts are not on the banned list gary stephens a pharmacology expert at the university of reading told the bbc it means the chemicals that are mixed to create it are much easier to deliver with no risk to the health of the courier novichok is more toxic and more difficult to identify than other nerve agents novichok is believed to be much more toxic than other known nerve agents in his report mirzaryanov said that one variant dubbed novichok was five to eight times as deadly as vx the agent that north korea allegedly used last year to murder kim jong uns halfbrother this is a more dangerous and sophisticated agent than sarin or vx and is harder to identify said stephens media reports suggest uk government is close to finalizing

in the aftermath of the attack police cordons remain in place following the attack in which former double agent sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were poisoned with the deadly novichok nerve agent a week after news of the attack first broke theresa may pointed the finger at the kremlin telling mps that russia had either sanctioned the attack or lost control of its weapons vince maynard a former soldier from barford st martin a village outside salisbury said ms mays announcement in the commons had been a bit of a surprise they couldve come out a bit sooner police have said a total of people had been treated for some degree of exposure to the nerve agent but health authorities warned on sunday that hundreds more should take precautions against prolonged exposure by washing their clothes prompting concern at the response time mr maynard expressed outrage at the use of the lethal poison in a public place what about the people who were in that restaurant and used the table after those people were the ambulances used again the contamination could have spread quite a long way any of us could have been poisoned he added residents are trying to get on with life as normal in salisbury you just avoid the cordoned areas jon sharman jean davies a former salisbury resident in town to celebrate her birthday said the attack on the skripals was carried out with very little concern for bystanders that bit makes me angry theyve had very little thought she added the fact mr skripals daughter was also targeted further angered her she said her husband dave added it just brings home the fact that there are baddies out there a market trader who asked not to be named said of public health englands warning they took so long to say that it was about a week on they said to wash your clothes he said he believed the drip feed of information had led to uncertainty about whether it was safe to come to the city and had kept people away particularly older people those who lived some way outside salisbury had visited his stall at a different market in christchurch rather than come here he added despite the air of concern as tuesday morning wound on and the sky brightened the market began to fill up with fruit and vegetable sellers serving a stream of people a varied set of stalls included bricabrac dvds and video games butchers trucks and a bakery almost the whole city centre is now open for business and traffic pedestrian and motorised is flowing as usual reports of a city teeming with soldiers and police do not reflect reality shoppers said a few metropolitan police officers drafted up from london wandered through the market square and were thanked for their presence police officers drafted in from london have been thanked for their presence jon sharman one woman said she was getting on with life as normal we were here on the saturday the day before it happened and we were here on the tuesday you just avoid it the cordoned areas you dont want to tread anything about but she added i think its terrible that they can come over here and poison him i dont like the idea of it the trouble is you dont know whos about a second stallholder said its awful but its not surprising its the way the world is going at the moment the world is a scary place residents said they were unsurprised russias foreign minister sergei lavrov had dismissed the prime

struck up a conversation offered to take her picture and asked her out to dinner mifsud an obscure middleaged academic originally from malta soon began dating the young ukrainian woman he liked to impress her by talking about his ties to important russian officials he told her he was friends with sergey lavrov russias foreign minister soon he was traveling to ukraine to visit her he met her family and eventually asked her to marry him they got engaged she got pregnant and then last fall he vanished anna joseph mifsuds fiancée whose story without her last name was recently told in a wellcrafted buzzfeed news piece stands at the center of one of the biggest mysteries in special counsel robert muellers investigation into possible collusion between russia and donald trump where is joseph mifsud on october mueller unveiled the first charges in his trumprussia probe that day his office announced indictments against former trump campaign manager paul manafort and his business associate rick gates as well as a guilty plea from george papadopoulos a former foreign policy adviser to the trump campaign papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to making false statements to the fbi in a deal approved secretly three weeks earlier so it was clear that papadopoulos was already cooperating with muellers inquiry the ambitious young greekamerican trump adviser was presumably telling mueller everything he knew about connections between the trump campaign and russia photo twitter in the court documents released in papadopouloss case one character jumps off the page a mysterious and unnamed overseas professor who had served as an intermediary between papadopoulos and the russians the documents reveal that during a meeting in april the professor had told papadopoulos that the russians had dirt on democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton in the form of thousands of emails that was well before the hacking and theft of clintonrelated emails was publicly known the court documents also show that papadopoulos had good reason to believe the professor he knew that mifsud had close ties to senior russian officials when papadopoulos first talked to fbi agents he tried to downplay mifsuds significance he told the investigating agents that the professor was a nothing and just a guy talking up connections or something in truth and in fact however defendant papadopoulos understood that the professor had substantial connections to russian government officials and had met with some of those officials in moscow immediately prior to telling defendant papadopoulos about the thousands of emails and over a period of months defendant papadopoulos repeatedly sought to use the professors russian connections in an effort to arrange a meeting between the trump campaign and russian government officials the papadopoulosmifsud connection is now exhibit a in the argument that trump or those close to him colluded with moscow to gain the white house when papadopouloss guilty plea was made public the press quickly identified the professor as joseph mifsud the papadopoulosmifsud connection is highly suggestive of a direct link between the trump presidential campaign and the russian government the relationship between the young campaign adviser and the academic with shadowy ties to moscow reveals the existence of a secret channel through which the russian government was able to communicate with the trump campaign as it stole democratic emails and weaponized them to help trump win the presidency the papadopoulosmifsud connection is now exhibit a in the argument that trump or those close to him colluded with moscow to gain the white house roger stone a longtime political adviser and friend to president donald trump arrives to speak and sign copies of his book the making of the president at the boca raton marriott on march in florida photo joe raedlegetty images hen i began this series of columns about trump and russia for the intercept i believed that evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and moscow was thin collusion i thought was the weak link in the middle of the larger trumprussia narrative this series of columns about trump and russia for the intercept i believed that evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and moscow was thin collusion i thought was the weak link in the middle of the larger trumprussia narrative at that time i believed there was much stronger evidence that the russians had intervened in the election to help trump win through a cyberoffensive targeting the american political system i also thought there was powerful evidence that trump and his aides had engaged in efforts to obstruct justice and impede muellers investigation further i suspected that congressional republicans were engaged in a similar conspiracy to obstruct justice in muellers inquiry i was much less convinced that there was compelling evidence to show that trump or those around him had actually conspired with the russians to win the presidency like many others i was willing to believe that trump and his aides were too haplessly disorganized and incompetent to have coordinated with the russians but as ive dug deeper into the evidence made public so far i have become convinced that the case for collusion is much stronger than i thought there are still plenty of unanswered questions but that case is getting more persuasive as new facts come to light on monday the fbi raided the office and hotel room of one of trumps lawyers although its unclear whether that will yield evidence of collusion in addition to the channel between papadopoulos and mifsud a series of other links also point toward ties between the trump campaign and russia some of these connections have been known for a long time while details of others are still emerging one prominent example of course is the case of the inflammable roger stone a longtime trump political adviser and manaforts onetime lobbying partner stone best known as a loud protrump cable news pundit and a political dirty trickster dating back to the nixon era has acknowledged that in he was in contact with guccifer the hacker who claimed to have turned over stolen democratic national committee emails to wikileaks during the presidential campaign wikileaks then published the emails sometimes releasing them at critical moments when they seemed designed to inflict maximum damage on clintons campaign guccifer is now widely believed to be a front name used by russian intelligence the daily beast recently reported that guccifer has been identified by us investigators as an officer in the gru russias military intelligence arm last year stone told cnn that his brief communications with guccifer were harmless and that he had only messaged him in august after guccifers role was publicly known stone has denied any involvement in collusion with russia in his testimony before the house intelligence committee in september stone said that those who believe that there was collusion between the trump camp and the russian state now say stone must have been involved but that is not based on one shred of evidence in february the atlantic reported on private twitter messages between stone and wikileaks in october the magazine added that wikileaks sought to keep its channel to stone open after trump won the election photo zach gibsongetty images despite stones defiant denials of any role in collusion mueller is still investigating stones contacts with guccifer wikileaks and julian assange muellers continued interest in these connections became clear in march when ted malloch an american academic with ties to the trump campaign and british rightwing politicians was stopped as he entered the united states and subpoenaed to testify before muellers inquiry malloch who is based in london told the guardian that fbi agents asked about his relationship with stone and whether he had ever visited the ecuadorian embassy in london where assange founder of wikileaks has sought political asylum the notion of a meeting between stone and assange was bolstered by sam nunberg the former trump adviser who caused a brief comic furor last month when he camped out on cable news ranting about his unwillingness to cooperate with mueller nunberg who is now working with the special counsel apparently gave mueller a copy of an email from stone dated august in which stone said i dined with julian assange last night the wall street journal reported stone has said the email was a joke but the same day he sent that email he had appeared on the radio show infowars claiming that he had dined with assange and predicting devastating disclosures about clinton according to cnn the presidents son donald trump jr was also in contact with wikileaks during the campaign and afterward also through private messages on twitter last november the atlantic reported on the details of those messages showing that wikileaks first contacted trump jr in september and the presidents son had readily responded in october according to the atlantic wikileaks sent trump jr a message hey donald great to see you and your dad talking about our publications strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us theres many great stories the press are missing and were sure some of your follows will

easily explained away the problem for trump is that evidence of suspicious contacts with the russians or possible intermediaries keeps mounting and the details of those contacts make it increasingly difficult to dismiss them all as merely coincidental communications might be easily explained away the problem for trump is that evidence of suspicious contacts with the russians or possible intermediaries keeps mounting and the details of those contacts make it increasingly difficult to dismiss them all as merely coincidental among the contacts that are now known to have occurred are many that raise questions about their purpose questions that trump and his aides and allies have failed to adequately answer in april for example trump gave a foreign policy speech at the mayflower hotel in washington at the same event thensen jeff sessions a trump supporter met with the russian ambassador to the united states sergey kislyak kislyak told moscow that he had talked about campaignrelated issues with sessions the washington post later reported sessions met with kislyak again in september at his senate office during his confirmation hearings to be attorney general in january sessions did not disclose his contacts with kislyak he later said the meetings were not about the trump campaign sessionss statements during his confirmation hearings raised questions about whether he had been truthful to the senate they also played a role in his decision in march to recuse himself from overseeing the trumprussia inquiry other contacts raise additional ominous questions about the depths of the trump campaigns connections with russia at the national rifle associations annual convention in may for example donald trump jr spoke to alexander torshin an official at the russian central bank with close ties to russian president vladimir putin in january mcclatchy reported that the fbi was investigating whether torshin illegally funneled money to the nra in order to help trump win the presidency torshin was one of a group of russian individuals hit with new treasury department sanctions last week an action that appears to have been taken independently of both muellers investigation and the white house it has become increasingly clear that mueller is aggressively pursuing questions about whether illegal russian cash infusions helped trump get elected torshin is a life member of the nra as is a woman who was previously his special assistant at the russian central bank maria butina butina has been described in the press as a strong advocate for gun rights in russia and has developed close ties to republican party operatives in the us paul erickson a longtime republican operative who has fundraised for the nra formed a company in south dakota with butina and emailed a trump campaign aide in about the idea of setting up a meeting between putin and trump under normal circumstances the fact that an fbi investigation was underway to determine whether the presidency had been won with russian cash funneled through a highly partisan organization like the nra would be enough on its own to spur talk of impeachment but with trump it is just one more piece in a much larger mosaic of potentially illegal or even treasonous activity since the news of the nrarussia link broke it has become increasingly clear that mueller is aggressively pursuing questions about whether illegal russian cash infusions helped trump get elected muellers team has begun to question russian oligarchs as they travel in the united states stopping one when his private plane landed in new york muellers investigators have asked the russians if they gave cash donations directly or indirectly to trumps campaign or his inauguration cnn reported this month mueller has subpoenaed the trump organization for records related to its business with foreign nationals including several russians the times reported monday perhaps the most infamous meeting between the trump campaign and russians took place in june at trump tower in new york when donald trump jr manafort and jared kushner trumps soninlaw met with natalia v veselnitskaya a russian lawyer explanations for why the meeting occurred have continually shifted ever since the new york times first reported on it last year eventually it became clear that veselnitskaya had gone to the meeting with a memo she believed contained damaging information about the democratic party and hillary clinton the times reported that veselnitskaya had discussed the allegations contained in the memo with russias prosecutor general yury chaika and that her memo was similar to a document chaikas office had produced photo brendan smialowskiafpgetty images one of the most intriguing connections between the trump campaign and russia was only recently revealed in documents released by muellers team investigators have found that manafort the former campaign manager had a business associate in ukraine konstantin kilimnik who had connections to russian intelligence that continued during the presidential campaign kilimnik was in contact with manafort and his deputy rick gates during the campaign and gates knew that kilimnik was a former officer with russian military intelligence according to the court filings gates pleaded guilty in february and is now cooperating with muellers investigation kilimnik was still working with russian intelligence while he was communicating with the trump team in september and october according to the court filings now there are new signs that mueller has an important ally in his investigation of the manafortgateskilimnik collusion evidence deputy attorney general rod rosenstein who oversees the mueller probe because of sessionss recusal wrote a memo last august saying that mueller should investigate allegations that manafort colluded with russian government officials to interfere in the election rosensteins memo was made public earlier this month the kilimnik connection has already led to jail time for one figure in the collusion case earlier this month alex van der zwaan a dutch lawyer who worked at the firm skadden arps slate meagher flom was sentenced to days in prison and a fine for lying to the fbi about his communications with gates and kilimnik gates and van der zwaan both communicated with kilimnik during the election campaign according to court documents the evidence of continued contact between the trump team and the russians after the election has also continued to build and now seems to be of real significance in muellers investigation american intelligence learned about a deeply suspicious december conversation between kushner and kislyak the russian ambassador the two men reportedly talked about setting up a secret and secure communications channel between the trump transition team and moscow using russian facilities maybe kushner was just showing his naiveté but his proposal to create a secret communications channel with moscow using moscows own secure communications systems presumably so us intelligence couldnt eavesdrop sounds like something a spy would suggest at about the same time gen michael flynn trumps first national security adviser was also in repeated contact with kislyak in december before trump took office flynn and kislyak discussed sanctions imposed on russia by the outgoing obama administration flynn allegedly lied to vice president mike pence about the content of that conversation and was subsequently fired in december he pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his contacts with kislyak and began cooperating with muellers investigation photo mikhail klimentyevtassgetty images one postelection meeting that has attracted special interest from muellers team took place in

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/27/russia-novichok-europe-brexit-britain-eu,849,625,historians may one day be able to describe how in march a major tipping point was reached in europes fraught relationship with vladimir putins russia they will also surely ponder how a militarygrade nerve agent called novichok first developed in the soviet union of the s and s became a deciding factor in a continent finally pushing back against russian subversion on monday and tuesday eu member states joined by norway ukraine macedonia and albania announced they would expel a total of alleged russian spies in a coordinated response to the chemical weapon poisoning of sergei skripal and his daughter yulia on march in salisbury the unprecedented diplomatic move came days after britain said it would kick out russian intelligence officers working in the london embassy the us canada and australia also acted contributing to the largest ever collective expulsion of russian diplomats by the west but this was a seminal moment first and foremost for europe european reactions are what matters the most to putin russias newly reelected president has long made plain his ambition to overturn europes postcold war order by upending some of the rules that bind it the eu has become anathema to putin for many reasons not least because it embodies a set of norms that run counter to the very nature of his regime and because as an economic bloc it can in theory exert leverage on russia as none of its other international interlocutors can this was indeed a decisive moment for europe and not just because of the solidarity demonstrated towards britain at a time when its relations with the rest of the continent have been damaged by the tedious task of brexit just one year ahead of the eus first ever breakup with the uk scheduled to pull out of the club on march european unity was put on display and very intentionally so russian diplomats and family members leave the russian embassy in central london march photograph andy rainepa the most important reason this came about had less to do with theresa mays diplomatic manoeuvring than it did with the exact nature and scale of the security threat that has suddenly been identified by europeans the first ever recorded use of novichok in europe where the use of chemical substances evokes thcentury horrors signalled that an entirely new danger had appeared on the continent one that warranted an extraordinary response the key point is that no european government has expressed any doubt about britains assessment that russia was responsible unsurprisingly mondays expulsions did not involve all eu states greece and austria were conspicuously absent but the nature of the support which encompasses countries that are either candidates for membership or strategically interested in rapprochement with the eu ukraine arguably said more about european convergence that it did about divergence interestingly hungary a country whose leader viktor orbán has a notorious track record of pandering to putin immediately joined the fray nor are these announcements the end of the story european officials say more measures are yet to come the key point is that no european government has expressed any doubt about britains assessment that russia was responsible as such this was nothing like the debate over the presence or not of weapons of mass destruction in iraq that involved significant dissent france and germany never took the bait so how was european unity achieved on novichok and russia in london several politicians and commentators applauded the government for its capacity to rally european support despite the looming brexit as if the much decried diminishment of britains influence had suddenly been proved wrong but sources in brussels and other european capitals offer a different take on events though british intelligence briefings made available to european partners had an undeniable impact diplomats were struck that britain initially refrained from reaching out to the eu as a whole and attributed this to the awkwardness created precisely by brexit instead british diplomacy worked at a bilateral level engaging in particular with eastern european and baltic states whose hostility towards russia is well known that piecemeal approach carried more risks than benefits entire buildings and squares in salisbury have to be decontaminated photograph david mirzoeffpa in the end three factors leading to a strong common eu statement and the withdrawal of the blocs ambassador in moscow were crucial first british weakness came to be seen as a vulnerability that was shared not something anyone could possibly gain from in dealing with russia moscow had targeted britain because it was europes frailest part the country whose isolation could most conveniently be exposed anyone doubting this ought to pay attention to the way russias foreign ministry spokeswoman reacted to mondays expulsions this was said maria zakharova a conspiracy of antirussian solidarity imposed by the british on eu countries secondly francogerman resolve was decisive according to european sources emmanuel macron angela merkel and may met ahead of last weeks eu summit to parade their unity later when all member states leaders gathered macron pushed vehemently for the strongest possible collective response france had long seen itself as playing a leading role in denouncing chemical weapons use in syria by the assad regime russias ally and it made the case that impunity in the face of such acts was intolerable but the third and perhaps the principal explanation for europes decisiveness was that member states saw a clear new threshold had been crossed unlike the killing of alexander litvinenko in london by russian agents whod dropped polonium in his tea the use of novichok was seen as an indiscriminate attack on innocent civilians not just a targeted assassination may highlighted this fact on monday when she confirmed that people were at risk of exposure novichok is reportedly the most deadly nerve agent ever produced five to eight times more lethal than vx entire buildings and squares in salisbury have to be decontaminated this put salisbury into an entirely different category from previous russiaconnected eliminations of dissidents in a category closer to terrorism novichok to that extent was a unifier for europe a matter of all for one one for all and yet the comfort to be drawn from this is limited after crimea war in ukraine nuclear sabrerattling and cyberattacks russias behaviour has taken on an entirely new and baffling degree of recklessness one that can put anyone in danger and while they pulled together european officials noted again the absurdity of brexit with britains selfinflicted loss of influence and ensuing vulnerability plain for all to see

http://observer.com/2018/03/theresa-may-announces-measures-against-russia-for-sergei-skripal-case/,864,633,for the past dozen years russian president vladimir putin has employed his spies as assassins in the west beginning with the murder of the defector aleksandr litvinenko in london in late kremlin killers have left a trail of bodies in several western countries but above all the united kingdom although russian spies have made only modest efforts to cover their tracks in these crimes the consequences for moscow have been distinctly limited no western country has been willing to stand up to putin and his increasingly gangster regimeuntil now in response to the attempted murder of sergei skripal a yearold former russian military intelligence colonel who along with his yearold daughter yulia received a nearlethal dose of a nerve agent on march in salisbury england the british government is finally showing resolve in confronting outrageous russian crimes perpetrated on their soil as i explained a week ago there is no serious doubt that the kremlin stands behind the wouldbe hit on the skripals vladimir putin has resumed wetwork in a fashion not witnessed in the kremlin since the days of joseph stalin putins assassinations abroad over the last years have been more aggressive than anything done during the russian presidents kgb career moreover his views on turncoats are well known traitors always end badly he famously explained in the year skripal was swapped to britain putin chillingly stated traitors will kick the bucket trust me these people betrayed their friends their brothersinarms whatever they got in exchange for it those pieces silver they were given they will choke on them the british government apparently agrees with my assessment since prime minister theresa may this week made two major announcements relating to the skripal case first on monday may announced that based on forensic tests the agent used to poison the skripals was a nerve agent called novichok which is indisputably of russian origin the prime minister added it was therefore highly likely that moscow stood behind this unlawful use of force may gave the kremlin until last night to provide a credible response to this accusation predictably putins regime provided nothing of the sort preferring its usual mocking tweets and sly denials with a wink and a nod alongside nebulous threats therefore today may announced that her government will expel russian diplomatsin reality spiesfrom britain as personae non gratae and london will cease all highlevel contacts with the kremlin they have treated the use of a militarygrade nerve agent in europe with sarcasm contempt and defiance may stated about russia mincing no words their response has demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events they have provided no credible explanation she added that there was no room for serious criminals and corrupt elites in britain and the large and wealthy russian émigré population in the country should expect scrutiny threatening to freeze russian state assets wherever we have the evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of uk nationals or residents true to form the kremlin has responded to british grit with hysterics and projection the russian foreign ministry using undiplomatic language stated that prime minister mays hostile actions constitute an unprecedented provocation which wont be left without a response kremlin spokesman dmitri peskov blamed london for the crisis explaining that moscow remains open to cooperation in the investigation of the case but we havent been met with any reciprocity from the british side moscow seems genuinely shocked by the sudden reappearance of british backbone putins regime after getting away with so many murders and other outrageous acts in recent yearsfrom ukraine to georgia to montenegro not just in britainappears taken aback that london dares to resist in fairness to the kremlin successive british governments proved depressingly supine in the face of repeated russian murderous provocations in their country so prime minister mays standing firm is a pleasant surprise for the west this pushback has been a long time in coming however and its not impertinent to observe that had britain demonstrated this sort of resolve after sasha litvinenko was radiated to death in london a dozen years ago quite a few russian émigrés might still be alive and the skripals might not be at deaths door either during the last cold war the nastiest version of the eastwest spywar was mass expulsions of diplomats usually in titfortat fashion the last time london did something of the scale of prime minister mays announcement today was in when kremlin spies were expelled from the country for exceeding their remit in response an equal number of british representatives were booted from moscow therefore we should expect that russias response to the current situation will be similar however under vladimir putin russias spy agencies are playing the espionage game with a rough edge not seen in the kremlin since the s not since stalins time have moscows operatives killed with such frequency and reckless abandon as putins spies are doing today its worth asking whether even joseph stalin would have authorized something so audacious as unleashing a highly lethal nerve agent in an english city this is putinist gangsterism coming to the fore although the regime embodies a rough sort of secret police elitism what the russians term chekism it has added a violent element that has more to do with mafias than spies many of the assassinations perpetrated abroad by the kremlin in recent years seem more like organized crime hits than traditional moscow wetwork theyre messier uglier and sloppier the line between russias security agencies and organized crime syndicatesnever especially thick in the postsoviet erahas all but evaporated under putin recent incidents like the discovery of pounds of cocaine at russias embassy in buenos aires raise awkward questions since diplomatic shipments are monitored by kremlin spies nobody could have gotten that illegal haul worth more than million into the embassy without connivance from somebody in russian intelligence we therefore should not expect that the kremlin will take todays british response lying down neither will moscow feel constrained by the somewhat gentlemanly spywar rules of the last cold war putin and his regime have the proven capability of lashing out with sinister violence all over the world moscow will not calm down now that prime minister may has asked for a collective response by nato to the current crisis as well as requesting that the united nations security council take up the skripal case four years ago after putin seized crimea directly challenging european peace and security i announced that we were now in cold war whether we wanted to be or not my assessment was denounced as alarmist and inflammatory by those who still wished to think the best of the kremlin today its apparent to all but the willfully blind that cold war is in progress and has been for some time the greatest concern

salisbury and trawled car number plate recognition cameras but police fear they will hit a diplomatic brick wall in trying to interview or at a later date prosecute the suspects the revelations come

even though the agent would normally be expected to react with naturallyoccurring chemicals inside the body he said this is strange given that days passed between the poisoning and the arrival of the opcw in the uk said mr yakovenko it might mean that the chemical was intentionally injected just before the blood samples were taken he claimed that the speed with which the chemical was identified after the attack suggested the uk already had its own samples referring to the governments defence research establishment at porton down he said we know what kind of laboratory is only miles from

chemical weapons convention he said the work of the opcw experts was conducted under the control of the british side pressure on them cant be ruled out they checked only the sites designated by the uk beforehand and they looked only for the substance identified by the uk the format chosen cannot guarantee impartiality and the comprehensive nature of the verification russia would not take the reports conclusions at face value unless it was given full access to the victims and to the materials gathered in the investigation he said he doubleddown on russias demands the meet the former spy

note to president vladimir putin and some earlier quibbles theresa mays counterparts around the dinner table agreed to make a suitable diplomatic gesture to the russians in solidarity with the uk among other national moves the eu will be withdrawing its ambassador to the russian federation in protest at the russians extralegal activities on british ie eu soil hes a german named marcus ederer by the way the eu say in a welltempered statement that the russians are very likely involved in the attempted murder of the skripals and that there is no other plausible explanation it is fair to say that this was not in putins little plan hoping that brexit would weaken both the uk and the rest of europe he has found much more unity than he bargained for he judged wrongly that the assassination of a doubleagent wouldnt bother anyone but the british indeed one of the more curious aspects of the brexit process is how both sides have become more aware of what might be lost as a result of brexit and seem extremely anxious to preserve some of the most important benefits of uk participation in and partnership with the eu even after brexit salisbury attack timeline of events hence the initial offer by theresa may or threat depending on your view in her original lancaster house speech to put security defence and foreign policy into the brexit pot for negotiation she got some negative publicity for that after all the war on terror shouldnt be treated as a bargaining chip but the basic idea of continuing cooperation even after brexit has in fact been taken up by the eu in the draft ukeu treaty for future relations there is an unusual amount of agreement on maintaining and even deepening the existing levels of cooperation it would ne be nice to think all of this was based on our common shared values and commitment to democracy the rule of law and freedom of speech all aspects of life under severe pressure in russia that is true to be fair but the pursuit of base national interests are never very far away whatever the idealistic rhetoric that surrounds eu business and this is no different one of the few strengths the uk possesses is its expertise in intelligence and security despite some notable failures over iraq its small but effective armed forces its nuclear deterrent and the sheer size of its economy and defence industry if i were an estonian glancing towards putins territorial ambitions or a finn czech or pole with painful memories of russiansoviet occupation i might well feel more comfortable with the uk firmly locked in to a europewide defence structure this in fact already exists in the european union though it is looser than the commitments demanded by nato for mutual assistance when under attack but it is something and worth keeping besides when donald trump simply ignores the salisbury attack in his communications with russia and has complained about the europeans lack of spending on defence you have to wonder precisely how

abroad but he has also managed to unite the europeans in a way few might have thought possible it has dawned on the chancellors prime ministers and presidents gathered in brussels that what occurred in wiltshire could have happened in burgundy or bavaria or barcelona and have drawn the obvious conclusion that we need to look out for one another when under threat from the russian secret police radical islamists and far right terror alike russia is relatively weaker as a direct result of the skripal attack an own goal what a timely lesson this is in the practical advantages and power of a united europe standing up to a superpower brexit or not maybe we can do the same with trumps vastly damaging trade war

into the skripal poisoning row it comes as britain dramatically moved to counter russian propaganda on salisbury today by releasing new evidence the uk authorities disclosed that moscow security services were spying on the skripals for at least five years and hacked the email of yulia who was poisoned along with her exspy father sergei last month russias report sets out a timeline of events the british response and the lack of information it claims to have received following official requests it concludes that the situation around the skripals looks more and more like a forcible detention or imprisonment adding if british authorities are interested in assuring the public that this is not the case they must urgently provide tangible evidence miss skripal the daughter of exspy sergei skripal pictured together has only just been released from hospital after being found critically ill alongside him in salisbury last month the report reiterates the kremlins claim russia had nothing to do with the salisbury attack on march and that the uk government had classified information in a similar way to the alexander litvinenko case as to the situation of the skripals themselves it concludes analysis of all circumstances shows that uk authorities have embarked upon a policy of isolation of mr and ms skripal from the public concealment of important evidence and blocking an impartial and independent investigation the report is in response to the disclosure made by uk authorities today which says russia tested assassination methods including smearing nerve agent on doorhandles the way the novichok poison is thought to have been was delivered to the skripals theresa mays national security adviser mark sedwill revealed the details in a letter to nato chief jens stoltenberg mr sedwill said the information underlined the uks conclusion that there was no plausible other explanation apart from russian involvement we therefore continue to judge that only russia has the technical means operational experience and motive for the attack on the skripals and that it is highly likely that the russian state was responsible there is no plausible alternative explanation he wrote the intervention comes as the uk tries to quell a huge russian misinformation campaign about the attack moscows ambassador to london alexander yakovenko launched another furious barrage at a press conference this afternoon accusing the uk of abducting the skripals and destroying evidence russias ambassador to the uk alexander yakovenko accused the uk of abducting the skripals and destroying evidence national security adviser mark sedwill gave more details of the uks case against russia in a letter to nato chief jens stoltenberg today theresa may pictured unveiling a war memorial in maidenhead today has said there is no other plausible explanation apart from russian involvement in the salisbury attack yesterday the international chemical weapons watchdog backed britains findings that militarygrade nerve agent had been used against the skripals the respected agency said an analysis of samples from the scene confirmed the uks assessment that high purity novichok was used moscow has refused to commit to accepting the findings of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw and proposed an array of other explanations for the presence of militarygrade nerve agent on uk soil one of the more outlandish is that it could have been deployed from britains own porton down laboratory eight miles down the road in his letter sir mark set out why the government believes that only russia has the technical means operational experience and the motive to carry out such an attack including some declassified intelligence material he said russia had a proven record of conducting statesponsored assassination and that it was highly likely some defectors like mr skripal a former gru officer who was exchanged in a spy swap in may be regarded as legitimate targets what is the novichok nerve agent used against the skripals the novichok nerve agent used against former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia is among the most deadly poisons ever created they were secretly developed by the soviet union during the height of the cold war in the s and s communist scientists developed the poison so it would not be able to be detected by natos chemical detection equipment they come in the form of a ultrafine powder novichok is up to eight times more potent than the deadly vx gas victims who are poisoned by the powder suffer muscle spasms breathing problems and then cardiac arrest there is a known antidote to the nerve agent atropine can block the poison but doctors find it very tricky to administer the antidote because the dose would have to be so high it could prove fatal for the person novichok poisons are highly dangerous to handle requiring the expertise of skilled scientists in a sophisticated lab dr vil mirzayanov former chief of the foreign technical counterintelligence department at russias premiere was among the team of scientists who helped develop the agent advertisement ad we have information indicating russian intelligence service interest in the skripals dating back at least as far as when email accounts belonging to yulia skripal were targeted by gru cyber specialists he said sir mark also identified the key institute for developing novichok in the former soviet union as a branch of the state institute for organic chemistry and technology at shikany near volgograd the code word used for the offensive chemical weapons programme of which the novichoks were one part was foliant he said it is highly likely that novichoks were developed to prevent detection by the west and to circumvent international weapons controls he said that russia had continued to produce and stockpile small quantities of novichoks within the last decade during the s russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents and to train personnel from special units in the use of these weapons he said this programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents including by application to door handles within the last decade russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks under the same programme we therefore continue to judge that only russian has the technical means operational experience and motive for the attack on the skripals and that it is highly likely that the russian state was responsible he said there is no plausible alternative explanation mr yakovenko said at the press conference in london today the british government still hasnt produced any evidence in support of its position that would confirm their official version we get the impression the british government is deliberately pursuing the policy of destroying all possible evidence an executive summary of the watchdogs report said the results of the analysis by the opcw designated laboratories of environmental and biomedical samples collected by the opcw team confirms the findings of the united kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical that was used in salisbury and severely injured three people foreign secretary boris johnson said the opcw had confirmed britains assessment that the substance was a military grade nerve agent a novichok this is based on testing in four independent highly reputable laboratories around the world all returned the same conclusive results he said there can be no doubt what was used and there remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible only russia has the means motive and record earlier this week ms skripal revealed she has refused help from the russian embassy in a statement issued through the metropolitan police she confirmed that russia had made contact with her but she did not wish to avail myself of their services despite the opcw findings mr yakovenko said at the press conference in london today the british government still hasnt produced any evidence in support of its position that would confirm their official version yulias cousin viktoria skripal protesting outside the british embassy in moscow and demanding to be issued a visa to visit her stricken relatives in the uk police officers pictured on the scene at sergei skripals home yesterday where it is believed he and his daughter came into contact with the nerve agent in the statement she asked her outspoken cousin viktoria skripal who has suggested yulias fiancé was involved in the attack to refrain from making contact and added that her relatives opinions did not reflect her own miss skripal and her yearold father were targeted in a poison plot in salisbury five weeks ago but the daughter has now been discharged from hospital it is believed that british authorities immediately spirited miss skripal away to a secure location when she was discharged from hospital the russian embassy reacted angrily suggesting in a series of tweets that the russian national had been taken against her will former double agent mr skripal was jailed in russia for selling secrets to mi but was released as part of a spy swap deal in and settled in the uk it is hoped he will soon be fit for release from hospital despite grave fears that the exposure to militarygrade nerve agent novichok on march would prove fatal britain has said russian state involvement is the only plausible explanation for the attack and has led a worldwide reaction involving the expulsion of more than diplomats yulia skripal called for family members including her cousin viktoria pictured not to speak on behalf of her or her stricken father

wrong please try again later verifyerrors this year the talk has been of a poisoned door handle back in august the focus fell on the mouthpiece of a white telephone according to court documents it was from an office phone that banker ivan kivelidi and his secretary zara ismailova received lethal doses of a militarygrade poison within two days both would be dead the gruesome murder is considered a forerunner to the skripal affair the only other occasion that a poison resembling novichok was suspected in foul play the bankers murder was eventually pinned on an acquaintance named vladimir khutsishvili according to prosecutors only mr khutsishvili was in kivelidis office during the hours the poison could have been applied in their version the poison an organophosphate nerve agent was procured on the black market from a scientist called leonid rink professor rink was a star of soviet science born in leningrad he worked at the scientific research institute for organic chemistry and technology in the closed town of shikhany in the southern saratov region from he was a member of the secret team that developed novichok nerve agents he continued the research up until the mids by the time of kivelidis murder in professor rink was already wellknown to law enforcement a year earlier he had been suspected and questioned over the sale of militarygrade poison to chechen gangsters when it came to court professor rink was not the most consistent of witnesses but by his third statement the most comprehensive he accepted he had sold a poison designed for humans to criminals after he says being threatened with violence in total eight or nine ampoules of this militarygrade poison left his secret labs this was easily enough to kill several hundred as professor rink himself accepted in court the substance he sold was known to a small circle of people a government secret and similar in toxicity to nerve agent vx the court documents revealed the name of the chemical was not mentioned in the documents but many have since drawn a straight line between it novichok and the skripals boris kuznetsov who initially acted as a lawyer for mr khutsishvili before leaving the country has even claimed the mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy reports included in case documents offered the most physical evidence of the existence of the novichok programme he said he had passed the reports to british authorities last month but mystery still shrouds the affair and earlier this week professor rink added to the confusion by disowning his earlier court statements he had not sold militarygrade nerve agents on the black market he insisted in an interview given to independent russian publication the bell instead he had tricked the criminals by giving them rat poison in a controlled handover under the watchful eye of the fsb russias security services he claimed to know nothing of the substance that killed kivelidi a number of obvious questions arose from professor rinks new assertions if indeed the substances were sold under the control of the security services how was it that two people ended up dead did that not then mean that the security services somehow knew of or played a role in the murder and what does that mean for the poisoning in salisbury the independent has reached out to professor rink for comment but was told via an intermediary that he was not prepared to talk facts are facts mr kuznetsov told the independent kivelidi was killed with a militarygrade poison and rink in court said he said he sold that poison a man has served eight years in prison for murder how can you now start denying things for mr kuznetsov professor rinks new testimony was an attempt to place distance between russia and the poison if the substance in the kivelidi

for the attack reuters but there is in fact little agreement on what the kivelidi spectrum actually shows vladimir uglyov one of the scientists connected with the novichok programme has suggested the spectrum matches a one of the secret novichok nerve agents but other scientists surveyed by the independent cast doubt on that assertion according to vil mirzayanov the scientist who first revealed russias chemical weapons programme to the world the substance most closely resembles tabun a nerve agent first developed in germany theres no fluoride in those charts thats the giveaway he said it was possible that the substance represented a newer analogue of the novichok class of nerve agents he said rink was researching new substances to take over from novichok compounds if those were banned but the spectrum could also be a fake we dont of course know if this spectrum is showing the material obtained on the crime scene this is russia dan kaszeta a londonbased chemical defence consultant told the independent that the case was yet to be proven the whole episode could easily have been a novichok or not the kivelidi case is shrouded in vague information of mixed value and credibility what the affair does show however was that in the crippling poverty of the russian s dangerous militarygrade poisons did occasionally go walkabout and it is not likely that professor rink was the only scientist unable to resist criminal forces mr mirzayanov himself told the independent that he was also approached by criminals looking to obtain chemical weapons its the first time in telling anybody this but yes in once i was offered a million rubles to synthesise a poison he said it was a very short conversation i said no everyone makes their own choices when i didnt have money i went out and sold jeans on the highway such revelations undermine british suggestions that the kremlin was overwhelmingly likely the only russian actor capable of implementing a chemical weapon attack using novichok in salisbury with the substance floating about on the black market any number of criminal and nearstate groups could potentially have that capacity three experts surveyed by the independent agreed novichoktype substances sold in the s could retain lethal potency two decades years later but even if poison were successfully smuggled into the uk there are other barriers to it being used in an attack its application would for example likely require making a suspension with oil and the substance would be very volatile this at the very least would suggest expert involvement these suspensions are so dangerous that even the smallest mistake will result in tragedy says mr mirzayanov youre bound to have a mistake if you have no experience and its here that were clearly talking about a state or military level of expertise concurrently poor handling would also affect the potency of any nerve agent one of the biggest drawbacks of novichok is that it is hydrolysed immediately said mr mirzayanov in retrospect only an idiot would choose to use it for a murder in england with its per cent humidity he added most likely the skripals were saved by the british weather and its interaction with said door handle

the attack in salisbury vil mirzayanov who fled to the us two decades ago claimed sergei skripal and his daughter would not recover from the poisoning there is no cure he told sky news from his home in new jersey there are antidotes butthey will be invalid for whole life dr mirzayanov said novichok was so powerful that extremely small doses could remain a danger to public health for years listing possible symptoms including headaches and loss of coordination its very bad because even the very small doses very small still they are very effective and then there will be consequences for years probably he added the former soviet union scientist said public health advice including washing clothes and sealing belongings was not enough and confirmed that hundreds of people could be at risk asked whether he felt guilty for his part in developing novichok he added i participated in this criminal enterprise because of that im probably the most fiery enemy of these chemical weapons its a weapon of mass murder the warning came as the government sought to reassure the public that the wider risk from the attack on march remained low neil basu provides scotland yard statement on salisbury incident public health england phe issued advice for people who visited the mill pub and zizzi restaurant where mr skripal and his daughter ate and drank before falling ill to wash their clothes and belongings and seal off anything that cannot be manually cleaned neil basu assistant commissioner of the metropolitan police said people had been seen by doctors in relation to the incident he told a press conference that of those patients had been assessed and discharged with mr skripal his daughter and detective sergeant nick bailey remaining in hospital and one person being monitored as an outpatient the officer said anyone known to have been in the same area as the victims has been directly contacted adding this is over a week later people are not presenting symptoms we are not seeing them professor paul cosford medical director and director of health protection at phe said there was no evidence to support the suggestion that shortterm exposure to trace quantities would affect peoples health the health effects of chemical exposures are generally related to the dose received he added it is clear that this substance can have a serious immediate effect on those who have a significant dose in contrast the general public who were in the mill pub or zizzis restaurant could only have been exposed to extremely small traces if any there will have been a huge difference between the dose those requiring treatment received and any received by the public life continued in salisburys city centre where shoppers have said they are getting on more or less as usual around

for anyone who saw the pair in mr skripals car a red bmw in salisbury between pm and pm on the day of the attack to call police more than police officers are currently working on the investigation assessing pieces of evidence and hours of cctv footage they have established that ms skripal had arrived at heathrow airport to visit her father on march and they arrived in the sainsburys upper level car park in the maltings at pm the following day theresa may highly likely russia was responsible for poisoning of sergei skripal they went to the mill pub before going to zizzis for lunch arriving at pm and leaving at pm mr skripal and his daughter were caught on cctv leaving the restaurant on foot minutes later and emergency services received the first report from members of the public who saw them slumped on a bench at pm theresa may has named russia as the likely culprit behind the attack because of its development of novichok and record of conducting statesponsored assassinations

push back against alleged kremlin murders on british soil read more in i interviewed a foreign leader who believed he had been poisoned by the kremlin the newly elected ukrainian president viktor yushchenko hero of the orange revolution that defeated a candidate backed by russia nearly died after drinking soup laced with dioxin his oncehandsome face was discolored and pockmarked by the poison yushchenko told me the wouldbe assassin was his chef who had fled to moscow where the kremlin rejected any investigation fastforward to now britain just accused russia of responsibility for the poisoning of an exspy sergei skripal and his daughter who were found near death in the city of salisbury the poison used was a rare sovietera nerve agent novichuk which is more lethal than sarin or vx it was invented by russian scientists for use against nato troops moscow brazenly denies involvement this outrageous attack is the latest in a long string of killings or attempted murders of kremlin opponents many in britain some victims were felled by other rare poisons traceable to russia prime minister theresa may has finally pushed back stating the attack represents an unlawful use of force by the russian state against the united kingdom britain has expelled russian diplomats and taken other punitive measures but may needs firm backing from nato and washington to confront moscows blatant attacks on british soil what she needs most is strong public support from president trump so far the president is hewing to his nevercriticizeputin policy instead nikki haley the us ambassador to the united nations made a tough speech wednesday calling the poisoning russias crime and denouncing moscows use of chemical weapons but given the way this white house operates no one can assume any cabinet official reflects the presidents thinking unless trump openly backs may and endorses retaliation against moscow putin will assume he can murder at will consider the boldness of the attack on skripal he was a former double agent who worked secretly for british intelligence was unmasked by russia and imprisoned then freed in a prisoner exchange in which the united states returned eight spies to moscow he lived quietly in salisbury in the old cold war days exchanged spies werent attacked by moscow times have changed the kremlin now seems determined to hunt down its opponents living in britain and elsewhere british experts believe professionals managed to expose skripal to novichuk perhaps in a pub or a restaurant or his car leading to muscle spasms and organ failure a policeman and nearly two dozen civilians were also affected the skripal attack revives memories of the death of alexander litvinenko a putin opponent and naturalized briton he died of polonium poisoning in london british authorities traced the source of this rare element to russia again the kremlin denied all the british response to litvinenkos death was cautious which critics claim encouraged more murders british authorities now intend to investigate other suspicious deaths in britain of kremlin opponents of course this doesnt touch on the use of poisons that have felled several domestic kremlin opponents and journalists or the outright murder of political opposition activists such as boris nemtsov in front of the kremlins walls however the skripal affair is acutely important it illustrates putins utter contempt for nato and western democracies he is clearly testing trying to show that postbrexit britain and nato are too weak to counter such murders several nato governments are now proputin and unwilling to consider new economic sanctions no wonder putin appears unworried about reprisals most important he appears confident trump will refuse to back may no doubt the russian leader recalls trumps shocking interview with bill oreilly last year when oreilly snapped putins a killer trump retorted you got a lot of killers what you think our countrys so innocent candidate trump made his feelings even clearer in december in an interview on morning joe after an effusive round of putin praise from trump joe scarborough noted the russian leader was also a person that kills journalists and political opponents and invades countries trump responded at least hes a leader that kind of thinking seems to underlie trumps reluctance so far to join in mays strong critique of russia over skripal when asked by journalists about the case trump waffled and refused to be drawn in secretary of state rex tillerson took a much stronger stand on the case giving heart to british officials but that was just before he was fired putin respects strength trumps waffling will only convince the russian he can pursue vendettas in the west with impunity it will further fracture nato and undercut relations with britain no wonder the kremlin dismisses the skripal case as a circus show they the kremlin have treated the use of a militarygrade nerve agent in europe with sarcasm contempt and defiance said may on wednesday does donald trump even care trudyrubin
https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-chemical-weapons-specialist-moscow-sure-no-one-would-trace-poison/4301213.html,913,666,vil mirzayanov is a russian emigre to the us and chemical weapons specialist who helped develop the poison believed to have been used in the attack in britain on sergei skripal a former colonel in the gru russias military intelligence and his daughter yulia mirzayanov spoke with voas russian service q you were involved in the development of unique soviet chemical toxic substances of nerve agent substance a and а known today as novichok newcomer at the same time you claim that no other country in the world except russia has ever had such weapons how were british investigators able to establish what kind of substance was used to poison sergei skripal mirzayanov to establish which chemical agent was used in this case you need to have access to a powerful highresolution mass spectrometer in the library of which are the spectra of all known compounds the sample taken is compared with those already known and the computer indicates a spectrum with a percent probability that is there can be no error here q but to do this investigators must have a sample mirzayanov that is the usual procedure you can take blood urine extract a sample from the clothes by using solvents there are a variety of ways q russian officials have repeatedly stated that the chemical used for poisoning exgru colonel sergei skripal could have been produced in other countries including britain you say that in england there were models of novichok mirzayanov the british could easily have synthesized it on the basis of the formulas that i published in my book published in state secrets an insiders chronicle of the russian chemical weapons program secrets each country takes care of its own security and as part of the study of possible threats a model could have been created so the test samples could be from many countries but the production was finetuned only in the ussr former union of soviet socialist republics and russia q did you publish these formulas in full mirzayanov in full i suspected something like that the attempted assassination of sergei skripal might happen so for a very long time beginning in i sought the inclusion of novichok on the list of officially banned chemical compounds but that can only be done by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw by agreeing to such a decision with all countries that are parties to the chemical weapons convention after my book was published this issue was discussed in a meeting at the headquarters of the opcw and as far as i know no decision was taken q russian foreign minister sergey lavrov responding to the claims of the british side accused london of noncompliance with the requirements of the chemical weapons convention mirzayanov the opcw can only work with substances that are on the list of banned substances within the framework of this convention novichok is not on this list and therefore the headquarters of this organization does not have methods to detect the chemical agent q you first declared the existence of a novichok in could these weapons have been upgraded since then how can you be sure that in this case it is not a completely different compound with similar characteristics mirzayanov it could have been improved of course but the skeleton of the chemical agent remains unchanged novichok differs from all nerve gases without exception in that it is based on the bonding of phosphorus and nitrogen none of the other toxic substances have such a connection so that novichok is a fundamentally new class of chemical compounds q novichok was created at the state union scientific research institute of organic chemistry and technology gsniiokht back at the end of the s working on that project did you assume that it could be used in such cases as the skripal case mirzayanov during the soviet period we always worked together with the kgb when markov bulgarian writer georgy markov poisoned to death in london in was murdered the ricin used in that attack was made in our laboratory but we didnt handle the murder weapons the kgb used its own laboratory for that q russian officials have claimed that the chemical agent created by you could have ended up in the republics of the former ussr as a source of origination for example they have cited georgia and uzbekistan mirzayanov that is empty talk the soviet union collapsed years ago and if somewhere in the republics there was pure novichok it has long since decomposed and is not suitable as a weapon any chemical toxic substance decomposes and there is no compound that retains its properties for a long time in the first year percent is lost in the second percent and the resulting products of decomposition accelerate the process of disintegration that is why the storage and disposal of toxic substances is a big problem which moreover is more expensive than production q you said that binary weapons could have been used in the attack on skripal and his daughter mirzayanov yes it is because of the difficulties in storage and disposal that no one now produces the socalled final product components are produced component parts that are relatively harmless separately which are combined immediately before use q and such production can be hidden mirzayanov yes for example while developing an advanced substance when it is undergoing incremental testing an agricultural pesticide is developed which according to its characteristics mostly replicates the substance that is the production of socalled semiproducts which are components of binary weapons can be carried out quite officially at some enterprise they can carry out a plan for the production of pesticides without even knowing that they are actually producing chemical weapons q in your view how easy was it to transport such substances across borders and then use them mirzayanov it was not very difficult you need two glass vials and any agent for creating a high pressure for example light volatile gas ampules must be broken before use and the mixed substances will provide the desired mixture then as an aerosol it can be sprayed but this is a very crude version and im sure the fsb could come up with a more sophisticated means q do you think the attack on excolonel skripal was pointedly demonstrative that is that the perpetrators calculated that traces of novichok would be found mirzayanov i dont think so this was really a demonstrative reprisal but in my opinion moscow was sure that no one would find traces of the substance this chemical agent does not officially exist it is not mentioned in any of the lists of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons practically no one has been engaged in its development for almost years it is obvious to me that moscow hoped that no one would catch them q but you published the formula for novichok eight years ago mirzayanov i dont know if the fsb saw my book perhaps it was read in one of the fsb departments but in another fsb department which was preparing the attack they had heard nothing about it the book q after the incident with sergei skripal did representatives of the opcw or any other international organizations approach you as one of the creators of novichok mirzayanov no nobody has approached me other than journalists

http://theweek.com/articles/764076/russias-deadly-nerve-agent-explained,915,668,how did it get to the uk thats unclear after whistleblowing exfsb agent alexander litvinenko was poisoned with polonium in london in investigators were able to trace the trail of the radioactive isotope across the city implicating specific russian agents and even the aeroflot flight they arrived on novichok made on the spot leaves no such signature sergei skripal a former double agent who served time in russia for betraying secrets to london and his daughter yulia keeled over on a park bench in salisbury they are in intensive care and a policeman who attended to them fell ill more than other people may have been exposed and could develop seizures or motor disorders the gruesome lethality of such weapons is why they are illegal under international law who developed novichok western and former soviet scientists say the nerve agent was created in a soviet lab in the s in what is now uzbekistan during the cold war the us and the soviets ran secret chemical and biological weapons programs experimenting with the deadly pathogens that cause diseases like anthrax smallpox and plague russia denies it ever made advanced nerve agents but when soviet chemist vil mirzayanov fled to the us in the s he revealed the existence of novichok its chemical makeup and details of its production saying the soviets had stockpiled enough to kill several hundred thousand people novichok is a binary compound meaning it is made by combining two other less dangerous substances just before it is administered that makes it hard to police once the poison comes into contact with a human body it wages a fierce assault on the nervous system causing muscles to involuntarily and violently contract victims can die of suffocation or heart failure within minutes their eyes rolled back even minute doses can cause permanent neurological damage there is no reliable antidote when were they banned the chemical weapons convention negotiated after the soviet union broke up in and in force since prohibits the largescale development production stockpiling and transfer of chemical weapons it was a huge breakthrough at the time and the us helped the ussrs successor russia destroy its stocks russia claims it finished doing so last september ahead of schedule and the us but theres a loophole production of many toxic chemicals with industrial uses such as in fertilizer or medicine is allowed as long as countries alert the international monitoring body such a system relies on the good faith of the governments involved russian president vladimir putin scoffs at international norms and agreements and has drastically ramped up russian research into biochemical agents what is putins motive in a essay in the government mouthpiece rossiyskaya gazeta putin said russia should develop genetic and psychophysical weapons to defend itself against its enemies since then russian researchers have been experimenting with everything from chemicals for crowd control to genetically modified pathogens biosecurity in putins russia a new book by raymond zilinskas and philippe mauger documents the recent large buildup at more than two dozen russian military labs and governmentrun research centers many of them former soviet biochemical weapons sites a walled complex in yekaterinburg the site of a accidental anthrax release that killed people has a bunch of new warehousesize industrial buildings russian scientists have also been purchasing expensive specialized lab equipment for freezedrying microbes and for testing aerosolized bacteria do other countries have chemical weapons russia claims with no evidence that the us is still developing them see box its clear that rogue states syria and north korea do have them and russia has assisted both countries programs during the syrian civil war the bashar alassad regime has used sarin and chlorine gases against rebels and civilians numerous times and russia has used its veto power in the un security council to block investigations after one such attack president obama struck a deal with moscow to remove syrias chemical weapons and the un verified the destruction of the listed sites but the attacks have continued north korea meanwhile is believed to be behind the killing in malaysia last year of kim jong nam the brother of kim jong un with the nerve agent vx how is the west responding following the novichok attack the british announced they were investing some million in a new chemical weapons defense center the us and other countries called on russia to cooperate with an international investigation into the salisbury poisoning nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg said the attempted assassination was part of a pattern of aggressive russian behavior including the annexation of crimea and the cyberattacks on western elections he said that the alliance was responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the cold war including beefedup troop presence in eastern europe and deployment of missile defenses but us gen curtis scaparrotti the supreme allied commander of nato says the alliance is struggling over an appropriate response to a smallscale chemical attack that russia denies responsibility for this is a relatively new area were dealing with he said and we just have to start thinking about this and coming to terms with it russias counteraccusations president george hw bush in committed the united states not to use chemical weapons for any reason including retaliating a chemical attack while the us missed a deadline to destroy all of its stockpiles complete decommissioning is scheduled for but russia says the us is secretly concocting new bioagents russian state sites have accused the us of being behind the zika and ebola outbreaks citing us assistance in containing the epidemics as proof of guilt last week russian officials even suggested that the us may have been responsible for the novichok attack using it as an excuse to further demonize russia the americans had access said lawmaker alexei chepa not only to the technology but to its development

poisoned by a nerve agent back in march and now russia is paying for the attack sergei skripal and his yearold daughter yulia were found unconscious march on a bench in a shopping mall in salisbury about miles west of london the pair were released from the hospital two months later and moved to a private secure location on aug the us announced it was imposing sanctions on russia for using a chemical weapon in violation of international law though the kremlin repeatedly denied involvement following a day congressional notification period the sanctions took effect on or around aug according to a statement from the state department british prime minister theresa may said days after the poisoning that it was highly likely russia was responsible and the us germany and france all appeared to back her russians charged over novichok poisoning of exspy used fake perfume bottle british officials say since the march attack a british couple with no ties to russia have also been poisoned by the substance in salisbury dawn sturgess died more than a week after authorities believe she was exposed to novichok the militarygrade nerve agent also used in an attempt to assasinate skripal charlie rowley was also exposed to the agent and remains in critical but stable condition on sept authorities in britain charged two russian men identified as alexander petrov and ruslan boshirov with the poisoning of skripal and his daughter as well as sturgess the nerve agent used to poison the skripals was smuggled to britain in a counterfeit nina ricci perfume bottle and applied to the front door of their house according to metropolitan police police believe the couple later found that same bottle thus exposing them to the toxic nerve agent heres what we know about skripal and the incident that nearly killed him his background as a spy skripal served with russias military intelligence often known by its russianlanguage acronym gru and retired in he then worked at the foreign ministry until and later became involved in business skripal was arrested in in moscow and later confessed to having been recruited by british intelligence in he also said at the time that he provided information about gru agents in europe receiving over in return whats the gru russias military intelligence agency things to know at the time of skripals trial the russian media quoted the fsb domestic security agency as saying that the damage from his activities could be compared to harm inflicted by oleg penkovsky a gru colonel who spied for the united states and britain penkovsky was executed in in skripal was convicted on charges of spying for britain and sentenced to years however he later was pardoned and released from custody in july as part of a usrussian spy swap which followed the exposure of a ring of russian sleeper agents in the us skripals wife and son have both died in recent years prior to his wifes death however she reportedly told police she feared for her husbands life the new york daily news reported how world leaders responded to the attack on march world leaders said in a joint statement they abhor the attack against skripal it is an assault on uk sovereignty and any such use by a state party is a clear violation of the chemical weapons convention and a breach of international law it threatens the security of us all the statement signed by british prime minister theresa may president donald trump french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel read the leaders called on russia to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the un security council to uphold international peace and security may had given russia until midnight on march to respond to the charges when moscow failed to respond may expelled russian diplomats from the uk they were given a week to pack their belongings and head back to russia this will be the single biggest expulsion for over years and it will reflect the fact that this is not the first time the russian state has acted against our country may said at the time the us also ordered russian diplomats to leave and announced it would close the russian consulate in seattle in response russia then said it would expel us diplomats and close the us consulate in st petersburg two dozen countries including the us ordered more than russian diplomats out within a oneweek span in a show of solidarity with the uk how russia reacted to the allegations on march russian president vladimir putin said moscow would cooperate with the uk in an investigation of the poisonings calling them a tragedy however putin said if the claims they were poisoned by the sovietdesigned nerve agent were true the victims wouldve died instantly russia does not have such nerve agents putin said according to the guardian we destroyed all our chemical weapons under the supervision of international organizations and we did it first unlike some of our partners who promised to do it but unfortunately did not keep their promises putin added that he thought any sensible person would understand that it would be rubbish drivel nonsense for russia to embark on such an escapade on the eve of a presidential

poisoning in salisbury and the death of gareth williams a codebreaker at the british eavesdropping centre on secondment to mi eight years earlier the yearold was found dead inside a locked red holdall in his bath in pimlico london in his bizarre death was previously dismissed as a bungled sex game but this week two counterterrorism detectives from salisbury where the skripals were poisoned by the nerve agent novichok on march will question a kgb defector about williams boris karpichkov claims the spy in a bag was murdered with an untraceable poison because he had found out the identity of a russian mole at gchq karpichkov a former major in the kgb told the sunday people that the shady security services were the link between the two cases russian security services claim they stopped killing in the s he said but i know the kgb and then the fsb and svr carried on killing and do so today and their trademark is poison the former spy lived near williams in pimlico and made a detailed study of his case he says a source in russias foreign intelligence agency svr told him williams was killed because he had found out about the russian mole codenamed orion yulia and sergei skripal who were poisoned by the nerve agent novichok in salisbury on march karpichkov says the russians tried to recruit williams as a double agent in an operation codenamed sweetie by blackmailing him they threatened to reveal his penchant for crossdressing the spy had worth of female clothing stashed in his flat williams had no intention of letting the russians blackmail him said karpichkov but he was foolish enough to say that he knew the person who tipped them off the svr had no alternative but to kill him to protect their agent inside gchq karpichkov pictured in london in march claims williams was a marked man because he knew the identity of a russian mole at gchq in cheltenham williams and orion had become friends while working at the government listening post in cheltenham gloucestershire and had joined at about the same time but the mole was too crucial to russian operations for him to be outed karpichkov claims orions spymaster living undercover in britain as a rich east european businessman codenamed lukas was behind the blackmail he said lukas when his plan to recruit williams failed turned up at his flat with a bottle of wine spiked with a mixture of amyl nitrate and the viagra drug sildenafil williams drank a glass of the deadly cocktail and passed out before a squad called the cleaners went to finish the job says karpichkov they injected a plantbased poison made from belladonna aconite and black henbane mixed with other chemicals into his ear with a needleless syringe the poison was designed to be undetectable when a postmortem was carried out williams whose bizarre death was previously dismissed as a bungled sex game karpichkov who escaped to britain years ago intently watched russian diplomatic cars drive through pimlico from july fearing he was their target he saw the last vehicle on august the day before williams is thought to have died in his alderney street topfloor flat and soon realised the spy was the real target a svr cleanup team returned to the property through a skylight to dispose of any damning evidence claims karpichkov the drivebys were the beginning of a wet job he says russian spy slang for an assassination by the fsbs socalled liquid affairs department i had never seen those cars before and i never saw them again he said he said something must have gone wrong in the assassination because fsb agents always try to get rid of bodies karpichkov pictured in london in march says he is on the same death list as the skripals no fingerprints palm prints or footprints were found in williams flat his dna was nowhere on the bath bag zip or padlock and the key was inside the holdall underneath his body an inquest ruled that his death was likely to have been criminally meditated but a police investigation later concluded it was probably the result of a sex game gone wrong karpichkov claims williams was not the only victim of poisoning by russian agents in recent years billionaire and outspoken putin critic leonid rozhetskin disappeared from his sixbedroom mansion in yurmala latvia on march the yearold who cofounded british newspaper city am was found dead four years later in woods miles away karpichkov said he was poisoned by an fsb hit squad bundled into his own bloodstained x then abandoned in the forest latvian interior minister markes seglins said the evidence indicated it was murder the same can be said of igor ponomarev russias permanent representative to the international maritime organisation in london says karpichkov he said ponomarev had refused to help assassinate alexander litvinenko who was poisoned with polonium in london in ponomarev died of a heart attack on october weeks before litvinenkos killing the svr wanted ponomarev dead because he was putting the litvinenko liquidation operation in jeopardy said karpichkov in response a zaslon death squad from londons russian embassy poisoned him with polonium and dephenhydramine he says not long after in november putin critic victor kalishnikov and his wife suffered suspected mercury poisoning and were treated at berlins charity hospital they claimed the fsb had tried to kill them karpichkov says he himself was warned in february that he was on the same death list as sergei skripal and his daughter yulia yulia has now been discharged from hospital and transferred to a secret secure location sergei remains in salisbury district hospital but his condition is improving rapidly

https://uk.news.yahoo.com/novichok-deadly-story-behind-nerve-152814849.html,934,681,against the backdrop of salisburys beautiful cathedral a new word recently gained global notoriety but the three people who had the right to know most about novichok a nerve agent were oblivious to its sudden appearance in headlines around the world for they lay fighting for their lives in a british hospital former russian spy sergei skripal his daughter yulia and police detective sergeant nick bailey were all exposed to novichok or newcomer to use its more parochial translation from russian in the english city on march the circumstances surrounding the case are still being investigated but the latest unconfirmed and improbable reports suggest that skripal may have been exposed through the air vents of his bmw car you can listen to an audio version of this article here skripal was directly targeted and perhaps his daughter was too although it may simply have been yulias proximity to her father that resulted in her exposure bailey was affected by the nerve agent as he was one of the first to respond and came into contact with it at a location as yet unknown the police officers exposure is more likely to have been through contact with the nerve agent contaminating some surface at the time of writing the skripals remain in a critical condition in hospital bailey meanwhile is reportedly making a slow recovery and may be able to speak about his ordeal perhaps providing vital clues environmental sampling will provide the evidence showing where the skripals were most likely exposed and hopefully how that exposure occurred while the full facts have yet to come to light the novichok attack is developing into a fullblown international incident the uk and russia which britain has blamed for the attack are now engaged in an increasingly badtempered titfortat expulsion of diplomats the uk foreign secretary boris johnson even pointed the finger squarely at the russian president vladimir putin himself johnson said story continues we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the uk on the streets of europe for the first time since the second world war so how did we get here and why do these lethal chemical agents exist at all the first nerve agents the story stretches back to when the first nerve agent named tabun after the german word for taboo was synthesised by talented german chemist gerhard schrader schrader was investigating organophosphate compounds for the third reich in an effort to find suitable insecticides to improve crop yields he quickly discovered that tabun was too toxic to ever be used in farming as it would almost certainly kill those applying it a year later however he developed a second even more toxic nerve agent sarin in debriefings by allied intelligence officers after world war ii schrader said that hed been required to inform the nazi authorities about his discoveries but while germany made munitions with both tabun and sarin which were discovered at the end of the war they were never used against germanys opponents reasons for this are unclear some historians cite hitlers own exposure to chemical weapons during world war i and his apparent revulsion towards their use in battle others note churchills warning to hitler that any use by germany of chemical or biological agents would be met with a swift response but the most convincing reason is likely to be the one mooted by schrader himself schrader noted in his postwar debrief that other scientists around the world including in britain were working on organophosphate chemicals and believed that they were almost certain to have also discovered nerve agents so if germany used them other countries would use them on germany in fact schrader was wrong only germany had the chemicals going global after world war ii however the uk us and soviet union gained access to nazi chemical knowhow and many german scientists began working for the victors at the time the prevailing view was that chemical weapons would almost certainly be used in a future conflict and so the military usefulness of nerve agents such as tabun and sarin was investigated but tabun and sarin had their limitations they were well suited for use on a rapidly moving battlefront because they vaporised and broke down in contact with water and so would disappear rapidly after use but this left a gap in the arsenal sotospeak for more persistent longerlived agents these were developed in the uk in the s and include the now wellknown vx this was the nerve agent used in the assassination of kim jongnam the halfbrother of north korean leader kim jongun in kuala lumpur airport unlike sarin and tabun vxtype agents which have an oily texture and are very slow to evaporate were considered to be whats called areadenial chemicals any troops or vehicles moving through an area where vx had been used would have to be rigorously protected compromising their manoeuvrability and fighting efficiency nerve agents were evolving but so too were the kinds of targets for chemical weapons increasingly they were being used against civilians who controls them about different nerve agents have now been manufactured and all are listed and restricted under the chemical weapons convention novichoks are an exception because they have never been declared more on which later in world war i before the arrival of nerve agents it was primarily troops who were affected by chemical weapons during that conflict some m military casualties were exposed to irritants such as chlorine and phosgene or the blistering agent mustard gas and around of those affected died meanwhile around civilians were injured by chemical weapons during that war since world war i however chemical weapons have been used by italy in abyssinia now ethiopia in by japan in china during world war ii by egypt in yemen between and by iraq in iran and kurdistan and between and by the syrian government against its own people sarin was also used in a attack on the tokyo subway by the aum shinrikyo doomsday cult killing and making thousands more ill this is not a comprehensive list but many of the victims of these attacks particularly in kurdistan and syria were civilians rather than troops evidence of iraqs chemical attack on civilians in the kurdistan town of halabja which included the use of sarin nerve agent accelerated discussions already underway on a comprehensive chemical weapons treaty at the un council on disarmament in the chemical weapons convention cwc was agreed in the convention became international law following ratification of the treaty by countries today countries are fully paidup members of the convention with only north korea israel south sudan and egypt still not part of the group however as the convention is international law these four countries are still bound by its provisions that any use of a chemical to deliberately harm another person constitutes use of a chemical weapon and is illegal the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw oversees implementation of the chemical weapons convention and supervises destruction of declared chemical weapons and any production facilities for these weapons to date approximately of declared stockpiles have been destroyed in october russia announced that it had destroyed its stocks of some tonnes the us is expected to complete destruction of its weapons stockpile by around in addition to supervising the destruction of stockpiles the opcw operates a control regime for chemicals that are either chemical weapons or could be used to make them every year each signatory to the convention is required to provide the opcw with details on the location manufacture use sale or disposal of these substances the opcw audits these returns and verifies them by random annual inspections of hundreds of military bases and chemical companies around the globe all manufacturing programmes which resulted in stocks of chemical weapons exceeding one tonne per year after january must be declared to the opcw but on march the opcw announced that it had never been notified about novichoktype nerve agents by any state so what is novichok and what does it do to its victims novichok family there is no doubt that nerve agents similar to the novichok family exist something that has been described by defectors from russia one of these was used to poison the skripals and bailey nerve agents including certain novichoks are part of the family of organophosphate compounds albeit at the most toxic end of the spectrum they all operate in a similar way by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ache the enzyme can be found in various locations in the body but its at the junctions between nerves and muscles where its activity is most critical ache regulates the message from nerve to muscle by inactivating the neurotransmitter acetylcholine acetylcholine binds to receptors at the neuromuscular junction instructing the muscle to contract the enzyme then removes this messenger splits it in two and with its removal from the receptor the muscle relaxes this cycle is repeated as often as required by the demands on the muscles inhibition of this removal and cleavage process sends all muscles into spasm and they no longer function normally the effects are wideranging with the most critical being on lung and heart function respiratory paralysis is common in severe poisoning and the resulting lack of oxygen to critical organs such as the heart and brain can have serious consequences if untreated it may be fatal exactly where when and by whom these chemicals were made however and how and who used them against the skripals remain unclear triggering a major international crisis the uk is now exercising its rights under the cwc and has asked the opcw to investigate russias socalled novichok programme this is the first time one party to the cwc has accused another of attacking it with a chemical weapon it will be a major challenge for the opcw which has been invited to send inspectors to the uk to collect samples for testing the opcw will use its own laboratory in rijswijk next to the hague and perhaps one of some other designated facilities around the world to confirm the exact identity of the nerve agent once it is confirmed the opcw will endeavour to find out more however it has never pointed the finger of blame at a user its remit is to confirm the use or identity of chemical agents and it can be called upon to carry out inspections in countries accused of using one others such as the un will then assess the evidence and do the finger pointing this is what happened when syria was accused in of using chemical weapons against its own population read more russian spy attack shows international law on chemical weapons is not fit for purpose the cwc does not preclude bilateral action by its signatories and britain and russia have already begun expelling each others diplomats over the row russia has also closed the british council and a uk consulate in st petersburg on the ground but what of the situation on the ground in salisbury where the skripals were attacked nerve agents can poison somebody though inhalation ingestion or skin contact which is why investigators in salisbury are wearing full protective clothing and gas masks in fact it is now the investigators rather than the public who face the risk of sustained exposure to any contamination some people have so far been identified who may have been in contact with the agent but none beyond the skripals and bailey have shown any symptoms it was reported that the skripals were essentially comatose when discovered and so were unable to say how they felt but paramedics would likely have found the couple struggling to breathe they may also have noticed twitching muscles a glassy appearance to the eyes with pinpoint pupils and profuse salivation in hospital there may have been evidence of increasing fluid buildup in the lungs and their heart rates may either have been rapid or slowed and uneven effects on the brain would be less evident as the couple were unconscious but can include restlessness headache confusion and convulsions a part of the brain is concerned with regulation of respiration and this may be affected directly slowing breathing a fall in blood pressure is also likely possible treatments antidotes to reverse the clinical effects of nerve agents are available and are more likely to be successful if administered early around cases of less severe accidental poisoning and four severe ones have been reported since in all of the severe cases the person poisoned lost consciousness and breathing was inhibited but prompt treatment by doctors who were nearby and aware of the potential for exposure resulted in the victims full recovery in a quirk of fate the uks own defence teams against chemical weapons are located at porton down just outside salisbury indeed there have also been tests on hundreds of military servicemen with small doses of nerve agents and in after one poorly conducted test in the uk a yearold leading aircraftman ronald maddison died the inquest into his death returned a verdict of unlawful killing its also claimed that in the novichok programme one person was accidentally exposed and died treatment can include the rapid administration of atropine this blocks the effects of acetylcholine accumulation by occupying the same receptors and reverses some symptoms but has little effect on skeletal muscle the rule of thumb is to maintain dosing of atropine at intervals until the heart rate is over beats per minute administration may be necessary for a significant period drugs known as oximes can also be used as an antidote these restore enzyme activity and crucially skeletal muscle function but oximes tend to be specific for certain types of nerve agent and it is unclear which would work with the specific novichok agent as there is little information in the public domain about them or their effective treatments faced with this dilemma the clinicians treating the skripals and bailey would have had to have made a choice a third drug used in nerve agent poisoning is diazepam which can prevent any dangerous convulsions which might occur regrettably however evidence indicates that severe nerve agent poisoning can cause longterm irreversible changes in brain function nerve agents are grotesque weapons and their use against civilians is a deeply disturbing trend but in the weeks to come there will have to be a dispassionate review of the evidence and as the spat between russia and the uk and its allies worsens cool heads will be needed amid all this frenetic activity however we must not forget the three victims and wish them a swift recovery after all they are the ones paying the heaviest price read more nerve agents what are

dont know whether it is just me but are there any others who are sick and tired of our mass media and senior politicians determining that the russians are unequivocally guilty of everything under the sun for until there is definitive and unequivocal evidence in our own courts no judge could pronounce someone guilty based on hearsay and could be the recent poisoning in salisbury is a case in point because he was a double agent the russians apparently must have done it although there still is no indisputable evidence that proves this fact lets wait is my thinking for the indisputable evidence to be released i believe jeremy corbyn is right here unlike the likes of boris johnson and the defence secretary together with labour mps and conservative mps who seem to have a crystal ball having travelled the world and entered many corridors of power i am not a lover of any government whoever they are nor indeed do i trust them after what has happened in places like iraq libya and syria where military intervention was often based on false information so lets wait for conclusive evidence that cannot be challenged jeremy corbyn appears to be the only one with a level head and intelligence at the moment or do all these guilty condemners know so much that they know what will win the grand national and everything else besides if so i would like to know at least the name of the horse please david hill huddersfield this russian situation is quite ridiculous theresa may must lack any sort of excitement in her life and is using this as a distraction from brexit casting herself as a

made sure the scandal was properly investigated and is now following through on its investigation tony blairs intervention to call off the uk investigation into britains involvement with saudi arabia in the corruption of that very same arms deal was if anything even more scandalous and should be noted in all uk media coverage of zumas trial d maughan brown york how much longer can trump stay after these sackings no no president trump the sacking of the former head of the fbi is definitely not a great day for democracy as you tweeted exactly the opposite is true in my opinion andrew mccabes sacking by attorney general jefferson sessions just two days before he was due to retire from the fbi seemed vindictive to me amounting to an egregious abuse of the power of your position as president of the united states you president trump have no business telling the justice department what to do that is interference with the law blatantly attempting to undermine the law to your own advantage another in a long line of these transgressions starting with the firing of james comey as head of the fbi last year because he refused to drop the inquiry into your business dealings with russian oligarchs and possibly the russian president and dictator vladimir putin himself this russia thing as youput it why the special counsellor appointed in the wake of the comey firing robert meuller has not yet charged you with obstruction of justice i do not know i hope he is not being confused by all the political noise that you are so successfully creating in the media mr trump put simply if there is no rule of law there is no democracy crucially andrew mccabe was the deputy director of the fbi when you sacked james comey mr mccabe now says a correct assertion in my opinion that he was sacked in order to discredit him as a witness to the comey sacking in any possible trial in which you could be charged with obstruction of justice it is true that mccabe has been found to be in breach of fbi protocols by an inspector general who i heard commentators on msnbc say yesterday has a reputation for independence they also said however that the mccabe case has been rushed through the unseemly haste to sack him before his retirement suggesting political bias and retribution the sacking just two days before his retirement means he could lose his pension after working at the fbi for years this is what seems vindictive to me plus the fact that president trump has been tweeting for just this outcome and it puts a murky light over the proceedings surrounding the sacking as congresswoman maxine waters is constantly saying this president needs to be impeached for the sake of americas democracy president trump must go genevieve ford aotearoa new zealand who will break the stranglehold

http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-britain-spy-may-20180312-story.html,948,691,british prime minister theresa may said monday that the recent poisoning of a former spy and his daughter in the city of salisbury was highly likely tied to russia may speaking to british lawmakers called the poisoning a reckless and despicable act and said it is highly likely that russia was responsible for the attack the prime minister said the poison was a militarygrade nerve agent of a type developed by russia advertisement although mays government had been reluctant to point the finger without adequate evidence given the myriad similarities between this case and the poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in there had been rampant speculation that moscow was responsible and that firm action needed to be taken sergei skripal is a retired russian military intelligence officer who was convicted and jailed for being a double agent for the british intelligence service mi he was released in during a prisoner swap and had been given refuge in britain where he reportedly kept a low profile but was not using a different identity russia denies any involvement in the poisoning of skripal and his daughter yulia but may said it is clear that skripal and his daughter were poisoned with part of a group of nerve agents known as novichok she said that based on the assessment of leading experts and on our knowledge that russia has previously produced this nerve agent and would still be capable of doing so russias record of conducting statesponsored assassinations and our assessment that russia views some defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations the government has concluded that it is highly likely that russia was responsible for the act against sergei and yulia skripal may said there were two plausible explanations either this was a direct act by the russian state against our country or the russian government lost control of its potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others whether britains response would include sanctions against russia remained unannounced monday may said the russian ambassador had been called upon to answer questions on how the nerve agent ended up being used on british soil russian president vladimir putin meanwhile advised britain to get things clear with the poisoning before discussing the matter with officials from his country russias tass news agency reported putin spokesman dmitry peskov said the skripal case had nothing to do with moscow in any case this is not our affair at all peskov said the aforesaid russian citizen had worked for one of britains secret services the incident occurred in british territory by all means this is not an affair that concerns russia let alone russias leadership white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said the us condemned the use of a nerve agent in the united kingdom she did not acknowledge russia as the suspected source of the attack the attack was reckless indiscriminate and irresponsible she told reporters we offer the fullest condemnation and we extend our sympathy to the victims and their families and our support to the uk government secretary of state rex tillerson expressed confidence in britains investigation and its assessment that russia was probably responsible for the poison attack russia continues to be an irresponsible force of instability in the world acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens tillerson said in a statement it was unclear why it took a week for public health warnings to be issued to the approximately people who visited the restaurant or the pub where the former spy and his daughter spent time march before being found slumped unconscious on a bench in the quiet cathedral city of salisbury on sunday the government issued an advisory saying any member of the public who frequented the restaurant zizzi or the mill pub should wash their clothes double bag any items for dry cleaning and wipe any jewelry or cellphones with wet wipes to prevent possible contamination it was described as a purely precautionary measure but residents reacted with a mixture of apathy and incredulity to the fact that authorities took a week to provide that advice why it took them so long to release that advice is really strange said sam peters who lives a few miles outside the town center youd think something like this would trigger advice its an obvious commonsense thing to do a table inside zizzi where skripal and his daughter ate lunch has been destroyed after traces of poison were found on it officials said ben smith manager of the avon brewery a short distance from the mill said he was not concerned and felt the investigation was being handled well smith said business was noticeably down compared with the same week a year ago this certainly is something that hasnt happened here before and never in a million years would you think it would happen he said maybe thats why there was a slow response time police are treating the case as an attempted murder skripal and his daughter remain in critical condition in a hospital a police officer who first responded to the incident and subsequently became sick is now listed in stable condition and is sitting up in bed and talking officials said the night before mays comments a leading russian television news anchor said britain may have planned the poisoning of skripal and his daughter as a way to fuel more russophobia in britain and

verifyerrors a powerful russian nerve agent has been used on a russian opposition leader according to the german government novichok nerve agents have been described as the most deadly ever made they came to public prominence most recently in the wake of poisonings in the uk where the skripals and others were attacked but they have returned to prominence as the german government announced it had found novichok in samples from russian leader alexei navalny who fell sick during a flight use of nerve agents of this kind is banned under international conventions because of the potency and potential horrible effects they are developed in secret to get around those treaties and designed to avoid detection novichok was first developed in the s and eighties by what was then the soviet union the name means newcomer in russian and indicates the fact that when it was developed it marked a major breakthrough in the power of such chemical weapons that new potency meant that it was by some way the most powerful nerve agent in the world and it continues to be thought one of the most deadly weapons available it can only be produced by highly specialised scientists according to the researcher who helped develop it and can only be used with intense supervision novichok became famous in the nineties when a soviet scientist called vil mirzayanov revealed that the country had secretly developed the powerful nerve gas which was far more potent than anything in the us though the soviet union had been developing it for some time it didnt become known for as long as a decade after it was actually available because it had been kept entirely secret it wasnt clear how much of it the soviet union actually developed though mr mirzayanov said novichok was developed in much smaller amounts meaning there might only be enough to kill several hundreds of thousands of people according to professor gary stephens pharmacology expert at the university of reading this is a more dangerous and sophisticated agent than sarin or vx and is harder to identify it causes a slowing of the heart and restriction of the airways leading to death by asphyxiation one of the main reasons these agents are developed is because their component parts are not on the banned list it means the chemicals that are mixed to create it are much easier to deliver with no risk to the health of the courier it works like all nerve agents by overriding neurotransmitters in the body and shutting down the way it normally works by forcing muscles to contract by attacking the nervous system important parts of the body start to shut down soon after someone comes into contact with such a nerve agent the heart and diaphragm will shut down and death can result either through heart failure or suffocation though it was developed to be as dangerous as possible when used it was also designed so that it could be relatively easily transported the nerve agent is made out of different precursors which are relatively safe until they are mixed for use in a weapon that would presumably mean that the poison could transported relatively easily to salisbury from russia its still not clear how such a poison would be able to make its way into the country as far as is known the nerve agent has stayed in russia since it was developed which is what gives the government such confidence that the country either used the poison itself or has lost control of it but the prime minister did not speculate on the people or group behind the attack or how it could have been carried out nerve agents were first developed by the nazis during the second world war and have been called by one expert possibly some of the most dangerous things that humans have ever made after the atom bomb just a drop of them is enough to entirely shut down a body and countries including russia the us and the uk have been working to make them even more powerful since they were first introduced prof robert stockman professor of organic chemistry university of nottingham said fluoro phosphatebased nerve agents such as sarin vx work quickly so in terms of halflives within the body this will not be very long minutes maybe hours they react in stages with the nervous system if an antidote can be administered within the first hours much of the effects can be reversed however the longer the victim goes before the antidote is administered the agents effect on the nervous system ages and the effects become irreversible within the environment these agents react with water to degrade including moisture in the air and so in the uk they would have a very limited lifetime this is presumably why the street in salisbury was being hosed down as a precaution it would effectively destroy the agent he added in terms of their effect on the body they interfere with the nervous system rendering the parts affected inoperable thus the uncontrollable muscle spasms the difficulty breathing the nervous system tells these muscles when and how to move and interfering in this causes the spasms the effects of the nervous agent can only be removed with an antidote given in time or irreparable damage will be done this article was originally published in the wake of the poisoning of the skripals it has been updated in the wake of the german governments announcement that it had found novichok in samples from russian opposition leader alexei navalny

instructing him to condemn the recent poisoning of a former russian spy in britain with a powerful nerve agent a case that both the british and us governments have blamed on moscow the presidents conversation with putin which trump described as a very good call prompted fresh criticism of his muted tone toward one of the united states biggest geopolitical rivals amid the special counsel investigation into russias election interference and the trump campaigns contacts with russian officials advertisement although the trump administration has taken a tougher stance toward russia recently including new sanctions last week on some entities for election meddling and cyberattacks the president has declined to forcefully join london in denouncing moscow for the poisoning of sergei skripal and his daughter yulia in salisbury england this month they remain critically ill trump told reporters that he had offered his well wishes on putins new sixyear term during a conversation that covered a range of topics including arms control and the security situations in syria and north korea white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders told reporters that skripals case was not discussed information on syria and north korea was also provided to the president in writing before the call officials said well probably be meeting in the nottoodistant future trump said of putin though sanders emphasized that nothing is planned the white house press office declined to comment on the briefing materials given to trump two people familiar with the notecards acknowledged that they included instructions not to congratulate putin but a senior white house official emphasized that national security adviser hr mcmaster did not mention the issue during a telephone briefing with the president who was in the white house residence ahead of and during his conversation with putin while russian president vladimir putin was reelected in a landslide victory on march videos emerged of alleged ballotstuffing at polling stations video the washington post advertisement it was not clear whether trump read the notes administration officials said trump who initiated the call opened it with the congratulations for putin one person familiar with the conversation said the presidents tone drew a rebuke from sen john mccain rariz chairman of the senate armed services committee who wrote on twitter an american president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections and by doing so with vladimir putin president trump insulted every russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election but sen bob corker rtenn chairman of the senate foreign relations committee appeared less concerned noting that trump has also offered congratulations to other leaders of more totalitarian states i wouldnt read much into it corker said advertisement putins latest consolidation of power came in what foreign policy analysts said was a rigged election in which he got percent of the vote against several minor candidates some world leaders have hesitated to congratulate putin since his reelection occurred in an environment of state control of much of the news media and with his most prominent opponent barred from the ballot ahead of tuesdays phone call national security aides provided trump with several handwritten notecards filled with talking points to guide his conversation as is customary for calls with foreign leaders according to the officials with knowledge of the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations the notecards are similar to the one trump was photographed clutching during a white house meeting last month with students and parents after the mass shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla officials said trumps failure to raise moscows alleged poisoning of the former spy in britain risked angering officials in london who are trying to rally britains closest allies to condemn the attack russia has denied involvement in the march poisoning but the attack has badly damaged britishrussian relations and british prime minister theresa may last week announced the expulsion of russian diplomats in retaliation advertisement putin has denied that russia had any role and called the claim nonsense asked about mccains criticism sanders noted that the leaders of france and germany also called putin this week and she pointed to former president barack obama who congratulated putin on an election win in weve been very clear in the actions that weve taken that were going to be tough on russia particularly when it comes to areas that we feel where theyve stepped out of place sanders said weve placed tough sanctions on russia and a number of other things where we have shown exactly what our position is she emphasized however that trump is determined to establish a working relationship with putin to tackle global challenges including confronting north koreas nuclear weapons program asked whether the trump administration believes that russia conducted a free and fair election sanders said the administration is focused on us elections advertisement we dont get to dictate how other countries operate she said what we do know is that putin has been elected in their country and thats not something that we can dictate to them how they operate senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky distanced himself tuesday from trumps congratulatory remarks the president can call whomever he chooses mcconnell said at his weekly news conference when i look at a russian election what i see is a lack of credibility in tallying the results im always reminded of the election they used to have in almost every communist country where whoever the dictator was at the moment always got a huge percentage of the vote trump has largely refrained from criticizing putin amid special counsel robert s mueller iiis investigation of the election meddling in february mueller indicted russian nationals on conspiracy charges the presidents tone has at times been at odds with that of his administration which has taken stronger actions to counter russian aggression including trumps authorization of new sanctions against russia and additional support for ukrainian troops in their fight against russianbacked forces its blatantly obvious that he has just an inexplicable level of support for president putin said julie smith a european security expert who served as deputy national security adviser for vice president joe biden you keep thinking it will change as he sees his own administration take action that this neverending well of support for putin will somehow subside its disheartening at a time when our transatlantic partners really need a boost europe is looking to us for leadership on russia in particular and theyre not getting it advertisement thomas wright director of the center on the united states and europe at the brookings institution said trumps actions were a sign he wants a prorussia foreign policy which conflicts with the harder line from his administration everyone is trying to figure out what does this mean wright said russia hawks say pay attention to us but not to the president or to the tweets but the reality is his reaction is policy the fact that there hasnt been a stronger sanctions response to the poisoning so far is policy trumps applause of putins victory was in line with other congratulatory calls he has made including to turkish president recep tayyip erdogan for winning a muchdisputed referendum that increased his already autocratic powers and to chinas president xi jinping for his extraordinary elevation after xi last month engineered the communist partys elimination

been a period of about four weeks or so during which that mortality has been higher than we would have expected in week six the week ending february there is about or so deaths in an average year in that week but we have had probably about to so it is that sort of increase over a defined period the editorial concludes we and others have already called for an urgent investigation by the house of commons health select committee we did this because the department of health and social care is not taking the slowdown in improvements in mortality seriously the figures for this year make the case for an investigation both stronger and more urgent with each passing day a spokesperson for the department of health and social care said we are absolutely committed to helping people live long and

http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-global-nerve-agent-novichok-20180312-story.html,977,93,news that a former russian spy and his daughter were likely poisoned by a militarygrade nerve agent in the british city of salisbury has spread fears over possible secondary contamination and piqued curiosity about a toxic substance that is as mysterious as it is potentially lethal former russian military intelligence officer sergei skripal and his yearold daughter yulia are hospitalized in critical condition after what british authorities said was an attempted murder using a substance from a group of nerve agents known as novichok which in russian means novice or newcomer so what exactly is novichok advertisement the former soviet union invented novichok agents and pioneered their manufacturing techniques said dan kaszeta an expert in chemical biological radiological and nuclear defense with strongpoint security a defense and security consultancy in london in a series of key takeaways posted on twitter on monday kaszeta said the agents were specifically developed to evade the westnatos detection capabilities and foil efforts to collect intelligence experts believe that novichok considered to be among the deadliest chemical agents was manufactured specifically to kill people the soviets and subsequently russian authorities went to great lengths to keep the program secret at a point when the ussr had already agreed in principle to chemical arms control kaszeta tweeted the chemical weapons convention to which russia was a signatory aimed to eliminate the production acquisition and stockpiling of chemical weapons according to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the novichok class of agents were reportedly first developed in the s and then refined to circumvent the international chemical weapons treaty which restricts the development and possession of chemical weapons according to sciencedirect a database of medical and scientific research the treaty bans weapons on the basis of their chemical structure and novichok as a relatively new agent was not subject to the treaty according to sciencedirect are nerve agents easy to make difficult but not impossible says victor madeira a senior fellow at the institute for statecraft headquartered in the united kingdom nerve agents are rare tightly controlled synthetic substances that do require specialized knowledge to manufacture store and use safely the business insider website quoted madeira as saying andrea sella a chemistry professor at university college london told the guardian newspaper that the level of toxicity of nerve agents is such that they are only to be manufactured in specialized facilities they are not materials that can be made at home she said british prime minister theresa may pointed the finger squarely at russia saying the nerve agent used to poison the exspy and his daughter in salisbury was of a type developed by russia may said russia has a long history of statesponsored assassinations and british intelligence reports have established that it has produced novichok and is capable of doing so again the prime minister said because of the complexities of manufacturing and even handling novichok it was impossible not to conclude that the attack in salisbury was either carried out by the russians or that the russians had lost control of its stockpile of nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others shopkeepers in salisbury england say business has slumped near the spot where a russian exspy and his daughter were found unconscious on a park bench gerry penny epashuttersock how can nerve agents such as novichok enter the body they are easily dispersed and can be absorbed through the skin ingested and inhaled according to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons kaszeta said at least one novichok agent is a solid at normal temperatures and could be deployed as a dust or powder allowing for slower absorption and powder would be harder to detect with normal chemical warfare detection means sophisticated and potentially deadly novichok is reported to be five to eights times more lethal than vx the nerve agent reportedly used in the slaying of kim jong uns half brother in malaysia last year novichok acts rapidly according to sciencedirect and those affected generally feel the full impact of its side effects within seconds to two minutes it is unclear how and when the skripals were exposed to the poison they were reported to have visited a local restaurant and pub before being found slumped unconscious on a park bench what are the symptoms and impact of exposure to nerve agents nerve agents are the most toxic of the known chemical warfare agents according to the agency for toxic substances and disease registry a federal public health agency of the us department of health and human services the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons reported that a low dose of nerve agent could cause minor poisoning with symptoms such as increased production of saliva a running nose and a feeling of pressure on the chest additional warning signs include impaired night vision headaches fatigue slurred speech hallucinations and nausea exposure to a higher dose of nerve agent causes more dramatic and pronounced symptoms the agency reported these include difficulty in breathing leading to coughing discomfort in the gastrointestinal tract causing cramps and vomiting involuntary discharge of urine and defecation running eyes sweating muscular weakness and tremors or convulsions victims can lose consciousness and in some cases suffer a rapid collapse of body functions and die consequently death caused by nerve agents is a kind of death by suffocation the organization reported is there a chance of secondhand contamination the short answer is yes because of the versatility of the nerve agent it can be dispersed as an ultrafine powder for instance it can cause secondary contamination though waited for days before issuing a public health warning british authorities ultimately cautioned anyone who had visited the restaurant or pub where the exspy and his daughter had dined and drank to wash their clothes wipe down their cellphones and jewelry and doublebag items for dry cleaning sam peters who lives outside the town center in salisbury was more puzzled than worried by the governments sluggish response to possible secondhand contamination why it took them so long to release that advice is really strange for more on global development news see

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-5672477/DOMINIC-LAWSON-Kremlin-ploy-shows-Corbyn-dangerously-aligned-gangster-regime.html,980,706,occasionally we learn something which is at one and the same time both completely predictable and yet fascinating so it is with the sunday timess revelation that an online army of thousands of russian twitter accounts disguised as belonging to ordinary britons had been campaigning for labour and attacking the conservatives during the final week of last years general election campaign its fascinating because nothing like this has happened during any previous british election its predictable because jeremy corbyn entirely shares vladimir putins hatred of us influence in particular the labour leader is as hostile as the russian president is to the western military alliance known as nato jeremy corbyn entirely shares vladimir putins hatred of us influence the labour leader is as hostile as the russian president is to the western military alliance known as nato naturally the kremlin would do what it could to ensure the next british prime minister would be in effect its agent of influence indeed until he became labours leader corbyn was a regular guest on the kremlins english language tv channel rt russia today and praised it tweeting try russia today we will never know to what extent these russian twitter accounts under names such as jessica langdon irene gray and gabrielle wilson actually contributed if at all to corbyns unanticipated success in denying theresa may a parliamentary majority in june but as the digital and culture secretary matt hancock observed yesterday the social media companies need to act to safeguard our democratic discourse and reveal what they know id hope this is a kremlin ploy which has misfired in the sense that its being made public will alert more people to the fact that jeremy corbyn is dangerously aligned with a gangster regime admittedly corbyn has done a pretty good job of alerting british voters to this fact by his refusal to criticise the kremlin over the use of lethal russian nerve agents on the streets of salisbury poisoning the british agent sergei skripal and this former russian intelligence officers daughter yulia corbyns head of communications the former guardian columnist seumas milne was especially assiduous in trying to persuade british journalists that the kremlin had nothing to do with this repulsive incident in britains most beautiful cathedral city but then milne an apologist for stalinism over many years was in given an expensespaid trip to appear alongside putin at a summit in sochi designed to promote the russian leaders great wisdom perhaps the weirdest aspect of this marxist schmoozing with putin is that while the russian leader was an officer in the former soviet secret service the kgb his sympathies are much more akin to fascism than anything that could be described as leftwing in the same year milne palled up with him in public putin defended the molotovribbentrop pact the alliance struck by the kremlin with nazi germany in what is so bad about it and the political philosopher putin cites as his inspiration is assuredly not karl marx but ivan ilyin ilyin who was expelled from the soviet union in addressed the socalled white russians who wanted to overthrow the communists as my white brothers fascists later ilyin advocated hitler as the only antidote to communism and even after the true horrors of nazism were revealed he declared that fascism is a redemptive excess of patriotic arbitrariness this was meant as a compliment that is the man so admired by putin that in he imported ilyins remains from switzerland and reburied them in a russian monastery with full honours putins sending his military to seize territory ostensibly to defend ethnic russians in ukraine is redolent of hitlers march into the czech sudetenland years ago it was in the same spirit that the kremlin organised a conference of farright foreign politicians supportive of putins annexation of crimea the british delegate was the bnps nick griffin putins sending his military to seize territory ostensibly to defend ethnic russians in ukraine is redolent of hitlers march into the czech sudetenland years ago the fuhrer claimed it was necessary to protect the rights of ethnic germans when corbyn made excuses for putins invasion i wonder if he knows what sort of company he is in i dont suppose he realises that putins biggest fans in the us are the former leader of the ku klux klan david duke and the neonazi richard spencer indeed spencer married nina kouprianova a selfdescribed kremlin troll leader and the english translator of alexander dugin another russian farright thinker admired by putin it is true that both spencer and duke had voiced support for donald trump in the property developers battle to succeed barack obama as president but the point is that while the corbynistas use this as one of their justifications for planning mass demonstrations against trump when he visits this country in july they would not dream of doing anything like that if putin came over here and while the kremlin has for years used ballot rigging and the jailing or even murder of political opponents to secure putins grip on the presidency of russia trump for all his crudeness is the freely elected leader of the western world and in that phrase lies the reason the british hardleft will demonstrate in london against trump but cosy up to the fascistinspired putin corbyn and those closest to him hate everything about the imperialist west therefore our sworn enemy in the kremlin is their friend as those faked twitter accounts demonstrate why amber was asking for it when on monday april amber rudd stood up in the commons and blamed the civil service for the callous treatment of the socalled windrush generation the home office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual she might have thought she was getting out of trouble in fact she was asking for it rudd has had a remarkably rapid political ascent she only became an mp in a more experienced minister would know the officials revenge would be savage thus over two weekends officials leaked home office documents to the guardian which completely destroyed the secretary of states position six days after her rash commons statement the paper published a leaked private memo from rudd to theresa may in which the home secretary set out her ambitious plans to increase the focus of her department on arresting detaining and forcibly removing illegal migrants and ruthlessly prioritising resources to that end amber rudd has resigned as home secretary after admitting she inadvertently misled parliament over home office targets for deporting illegal immigrants this was sent to the pm just months before the windrush migrants were threatened with deportation in other words rudd had been pushing officials to behave in exactly the way she then criticised them for in the house of commons last saturday the guardian leaked a memo copied in to rudd which had informed her that the home office set a target of achieving enforced returns of illegal migrants in coming only days after rudd had told parliament we dont have targets for removals this was a devastating exposure of ministerial ignorance at best rudds only and hopeless defence had been to say she wasnt aware of the targets interestingly there was never any talk of a leak inquiry the normal government response in such circumstances ms rudd had no stomach for further conflict with her officials and last night she surrendered

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/salisbury-britain-friends-europe-eu-allies-defence,1015,718,of all the vacuous slogans generated by the entire brexit campaign and process global britain is the most vacuous of all not before time the phrase is being called out for what it really is last week the commons foreign affairs select committee dismissed it as meaningless the former head of the foreign office trashed it as mushy thinking while the economist scorned it as globaloney yet still theresa may presses on with using it she was at it again today in prime ministers questions after a sycophantic backbencher had suggested to her that leaving the eu provided britains greatest opportunity may responded that a truly global britain would soon be able to forge its own way in the world the operative word there was forge for this is dishonest nonsense on stilts global britain is a slogan masquerading as a policy predictably it therefore appeals to boris johnson the foreign secretary has said it shows that britain is not some bitpart or spear carrier on the world stage in fact as the economists columnist rightly pointed out it is three foolish ideas rolled into one complacent grandiloquence about britains standing dismissive perversity towards europe and postimperial fantasy about the englishspeaking anglosphere over several months the tory mp tom tugendhat and his foreign affairs committee colleagues have been asking ministers and diplomats to clarify what exactly global britain is supposed to mean the diplomats offerings the mps report last week confirmed consisted of confusion and platitudes the foreign offices memo to the committee was little more than a detailfree restatement of what the department is doing already the salisbury attack on sergei and yulia skripal ought to be a national wakeup call about such muddled lazy thinking whether it was carefully timed is unclear but it was certainly much more than an attempted spyonspy murder attempt it was a stateonstate declaration the attack on the skripals coming on top of several other mysterious deaths of highprofile russians proclaimed to the world that britain is a weak country and getting weaker at the start of this year a senior british diplomat told me that postbrexit the big message he got when he talked to opposite numbers was that the world sees britain leaving the eu as a step away from reality it sends them he said an unmistakable signal that britain does not matter as much any more and that it is turning inward and this has happened just at a time when the us is ruled by a compulsive disruptor and china by a strategic autocrat at the time when britain remains bent on leaving the eu many policymakers are cleaving more determinedly to europe yet behind the rhetorical flatulence something interesting may nevertheless be happening that something is the very opposite of what the global britain fantasists either want or intend for at precisely the time when britain still remains bent on leaving the eu many of the uks policymakers are cleaving ever more determinedly to europe in other ways the most striking of these moves is in the uk defence world and it has permission from the very top may often says that britain wants a deep and special security relationship with europe after leaving the eu the words often seem ridiculous in a brexit context but in defence they describe something increasingly real malcolm chalmers of the royal united services institute wrote recently that on most of the issues facing european nations the uk is now closer to its main european allies than it is to the us this week in a rare ontherecord speech the permanent secretary for the mod stephen lovegrove put a name to it he called it a policy of leaning to europe lovegroves speech on tuesday to kings college londons strand group was very clear it was an absolute priority to be a partner in continuing european defence projects in the task of defending the nation and in defence planning were not going to do ourselves any favours if we pretend we can row our own boat britains allies saw it the same way you cant optimise european defence without britain he added in defence terms this is not really new thinking along with france britain has long been the highest spending and best equipped of the western european nato states what makes it new though is the context in the age of trump and brexit these assertions that britain intends to continue to treat collective european security as an absolute priority inevitably seem freshly freighted they have nothing to do with the global britain claptrap they have everything to do with a hardheaded recognition that when the chips are down as they are in the skripal case for instance britain is a european nation and a european partner it would be extremely surprising if they were not reflected in the outcome of the current strategic defence and security review the skripal case has underlined this in many ways what did may do after the attack she didnt pretend to be leading a superpower she didnt threaten war she didnt adopt the inane approach of blowing raspberries at russia as johnson and the new and unimposing defence secretary gavin williamson did instead she stayed on the moral high ground she turned to britains allies on the basis of their shared values understanding alliances is just as important for political leaders as understanding threats britains allies are in nato and for another months the eu both have responded decisively to uk calls for solidarity in the last week and for good reason any state that decides it can murder people in our country will ultimately be prevented from doing so only by the opposition of a collective security alliance that efficiently penalises those who ignore international rules that is why these alliances exist and it is why britain should continue to be part of both of them especially now

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/30/russian-retaliation-end-unclear-us-expulsions-skripal,1024,730,russias announcement that it will expel us diplomats and close the american consulate in st petersburg was a predictable and symmetrical response to the surprisingly tough decision by washington to throw out russian diplomats but left unanswered the question over how far the deterioration in western diplomatic relations with moscow has yet to descend the fallout from the attempted poisoning of the former russian double agent sergei skripal has a pas de deux quality about it with both sides appearing to know the next steps and after the american expulsions it was inevitable that the russian foreign ministry would punish the european countries it believes succumbed to us and uk bullying by also expelling russian diplomats from their capitals european ambassadors were summoned one by one to the russian foreign ministry on friday to be informed of the individuals among their moscow staff being expelled remonstrations would have been made but one or two diplomats per embassy and sometimes their families will now pack their bags and head home largely blameless victims caught in the diplomatic crossfire that does not mean the crisis will necessarily end there or that the crisis is contained russia whose standing among the international community is badly damaged is determined to do go further to clear its name or at least throw up enough chaff so that a chunk of western public opinion doubts the british intelligence services account of skripals poisoning moscow has already suggested a meeting on monday of the executive of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw to have an honest conversation about the poisoning the opcw is studying samples provided by the uk of the novichok nerve agent allegedly used but does not have the ability to judge the identity of the person that placed the agent by the door of skripals house but the russian foreign minister sergei lavrov is determined to put the uk on the defensive and has already claimed that if our western partners dodge the meeting then it will be further evidence that every thing that is happened is a provocation russia has also responded to the apparent recovery of yulia skripal who was poisoned alongside her father she may be able to provide insights into how the poisoning occurred or even reveal whether she knows of some other motive by some other nonstate actor the british intelligence services will be debriefing her as soon as her health permits it would clearly be a huge embarrassment for the uk government if it emerged she believed the russian state was not involved as it is the uk government is aware that some allied leaders despite the public show of solidarity face sceptical voters at home who are either against a confrontation with vladimir putin or expect more convincing proof to be provided the uk foreign secretary boris johnson in a speech late on wednesday waxed lyrical about how the skripal episode represented a turning point in the wests approach to russia but his officials are aware that this mood can easily dissipate as other considerations such as commerce energy security or the middle east come into play the uk will try to push for further measures against russia at the june meeting of the eu heads of state if it is ambitious it may may challenge german support for nord stream the gas pipeline from russia that could put european energy demand at the mercy of moscow the great unknown is the stance of donald trump despite a phone call with theresa may this week the actions of the us administration have been strong and the words of the state department equally vehement state department officials will be in london next week to discuss the next steps with their uk counterparts but trump has largely been silent about the episode and his reluctance to fall out with putin personally for whatever reason is glaring it is hard to estimate how much the us president will prevail upon his russian counterpart to rethink moscows strategy of slow remorseless hybrid confrontation there is also a sense that confrontation can be a cul de sac wolfgang ischinger the german ambassador to the uk at the time of the alexander litvinenko poisoning in london in said this week there is already a massive trust deficit and that trust is even further damaged with the suspicion that russia was behind the attack tolerated it or was negligent in letting it happen i see even less of a future in being able to try to rebuild trust with russia the consequence would be even lower chances of discussing arms control military cooperation and a solution to the donbass conflict we are playing with fire and i hope that it is also clear to the russian side that this is not in its interest diplomacys greatest asset is trust and that is getting ruined here

the kremlin of glorying in the poisoning of the double agent sergei skripal the foreign secretary said russia had deliberately chosen the sovietera nerve agent novichok in the salisbury attack as a warning to opponents of vladimir putin theresa may will visit salisbury on thursday to meet local businesses and members of the public as well as receiving a briefing from public health england speaking as the international community rallied behind the uk including the previously sceptical french johnson said russia is the only country known to have developed this type of agent im afraid the

complete picture of these events and we will use some of them in our reporting was this helpful thank you for your feedback commenting on russias dismissal of the accusation he told bbc news there is something in the kind of smug sarcastic response that weve heard that indicates their fundamental guilt they want to simultaneously deny it yet at the same time to glory in it he also suggested that putin had some responsibility for the attack there is very little doubt in peoples minds that this is a signature act by the russia state deliberately using novichok a nerve agent developed by russia to punish a russian defector as they would see it and in the run up to vladimir putins election this was a former russian agent living in this country who had been singled out already by the russian state as an object for revenge and retaliation and vladimir putin has been on the tv only recently saying that such people deserve to be poisoned to choke on their own pieces of silver this is a way of showing look at what happens to people who stand up to our regime johnson said he had been very heartened by the strength of the support around the world for britains stance against russia on wednesday a spokesman for the french president emmanuel macron cautioned the uk not to engage in fantasy politics but on thursday after holding talks with theresa may on the incident macron shifted stance saying france shared the uks conclusion that there was no other plausible explanation other than the involvement of russia the elysée palace said the uk had kept france closely informed of the clues gathered by british investigators as well as the evidence demonstrating the responsibility of russia in the attack france accepts this conclusion and expresses its full solidarity with its ally the statement said the us ambassador to the united nations nikki haley gave unambiguous support to the uk at the security council pressed repeatedly on bbc radio s today programme about earlier french scepticism about the uks claims johnson said president macron has issued a very strong statement of condemnation he added different french spokespeople were saying different things johnson also confirmed the uk would provide samples of the nerve agent used in the attack to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons uk not interested in the truth says russian un ambassador video he said we have been entirely in conformity with opcw procedures we will be submitting a sample so that they can look at the novichok and make their own assessment we believe the evidence is absolutely overwhelming he defended the uks decision to expel russian diplomats in response to the attack he said what we have done in expelling diplomats probably undeclared agents is something far beyond what vladimir putin had bargained for we have basically eviscerated his intelligence capabilities in this country for decades to come johnsons comments come after he employed deliberately churchillian language in an opinion piece for the washington post writing a tranquil medieval city has witnessed the first offensive use of a nerve agent in europe since world war ii he added britain is striving to uphold the rules on which the safety of every country depends i hope and believe that our friends will stand alongside us there is a reason for choosing novichok in its blatant russianness the nerve agent sends a signal to all who may be thinking of dissent in the intensifying repression of putins russia maria zakharova the spokeswoman for the russian foreign ministry accused britain of refusing to cooperate with moscow in the investigation of the incident zakharova who said moscow was concerned about the use of chemical weapons in britain said allegations that

human rights abuses russias us twitter account has yet to dethrone its british counterpart that has refined the art of trolling western governments for years using the handle russianembassy not all of the photos or memes shared by the official accounts are actually produced by russian diplomats the one below was first circulated in protrump groups on reddit according to my colleague adam taylor and then shared by the account of the russian embassy in britain in an attempt to ridicule allegations of russian election hacking in europe and north america russian embassy uk tweeted its like epidemic

see the last of this hapless adm according to moscowbased journalist alexey kovalev many of the tweets used by official russian accounts in response to western allegations follow a similar pattern they deny basic facts and deflect any responsibility kovalev wrote on twitter in february while russias diplomats may use modern platforms their strategy is also rooted in far older concepts the russian responses rarely directly disprove the allegations made by western officials but are instead a mere attempt to expose the alleged hypocrisy of the west itself this strategy known as whataboutism has long been deployed by the soviet union but appears to work especially well online finally kovalev argued the choice of a comically bad pic gives the tweets their final touch it further distracts from the often serious nature of the allegations the tweets seek to address those tweets are seeking to disrupt conventional narratives and to provide an alternative perspective in a way that is hard to counter with the usual style of rational argument london school of economics professor charlie beckett told vice in even when they attract critical responses they have achieved

other than its deployment by the russian government dmitry peskov vladimir putins spokesman said on friday that russia doesnt understand the eus decision and said moscow would need to study the exact measures being taken by the bloc before it could respond ms may urged leaders at a dinner of the european council in brussels to go further than their foreign ministers had on monday when the bloc

recalled for consultations following the incident it is also understood that ireland france estonia poland latvia and lithuania are considering the expulsion of russian diplomats following the uks

involvement in the poisoning mr peskov said we dont know what info the uk had when it discussed with eu colleagues we dont understand it russia has not had the opportunity to receive a diagnosis on the skripals regarding the eu decision we are unhappy with highly likely formulations russia categorically has nothing to do with the skripal poisoning speaking at the summit on friday taoiseach leo varadkar said what well now consider in the coming days is whether we want to take individual action relating to russian diplomats in ireland bearing in mind what the uk did was to expel diplomats who

welcome the fact that the eu council has agreed with the uk governments assessment that it is highly likely that russia was responsible for the attempted murder that took place on the streets of salisbury and that there is no plausible alternative explanation russia and the threat that russia poses respects no borders and that is a threat to our values and it is right that here in the eu council we are standing together to uphold those values im going to be back here tomorrow morning at the eu council when we have a very important discussion on trade former russian intelligence

about the treatment but nerve agent attach themselves to certain enzymes in the body which then stops the nerves from functioning this results in symptoms such as sickness and hallucinations our job in treating the patients is to stabilise them ensuring that they can breathe and that blood can continue to circulate we then needed to use a variety of different drugs to support the patients until they could create more enzymes to replace those effected by the poisoning we also used special decontamination techniques to remove any residual toxins both patients have responded exceptionally well to the treatment we have been providing but equally both patients are at different stages in their recovery she went on to thank her staff for looking after yulia and sergei her father sergei remains

diplomats probably wont be enough gabuev said there are other elements to britains reaction and you need to give a mirror response to that as well the russian government also has been vague about its

the college of arts humanities and social sciences at the university of minnesota duluth discuss the emergence of monkeypox and other diseases international responses and messaging around health issues that especially affect the lgbtq community jennifer nuzzo senior fellow for global health at cfr moderates learn more about cfrs religion and foreign policy program faskianos thank you and welcome to the council on foreign relations social justice webinar series the purpose of this series is to explore social justice issues and how they shape policy at home and abroad through discourse with members of the faith community im irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr as a reminder this webinar is on the record and it will be made available on cfrs website cfrorg and on the itunes podcast channel religion and foreign policy as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy were delighted to have jennifer nuzzo senior fellow for global health at cfr to moderate todays discussion on infectious diseases dr nuzzo is a senior fellow for global health here at cfr shes also a professor of epidemiology and the inaugural director of the pandemic center at brown universitys school of public health her work focuses on global health security public health preparedness and response and health systems resilience in addition to her research she directs the outbreak observatory which conducts operational research to improve outbreak preparedness and response and she advises national governments and forprofit and nonprofit organizations on pandemic preparedness and response and worked tirelessly during the covid pandemic to advise and tell people what was going on to the extent that we knew as we made our way through this twoandahalfyear pandemic so jennifer im going to turn it over to you to introduce our speakers nuzzo great thank you irina thanks for that introduction and thanks for organizing this webinar today im very glad that were having this conversation as someone whos worked in infectious diseases for my entire career i have found the last few years to be particularly staggering i was looking and as of today there are more than million cases of covid that have been reported globally upwards of million diagnosed deaths that have been reported worldwide at the same time we are also seeing a global surge in cases of monkeypox a disease that many hadnt heard of prior to this past year and now we are over cases that have been reported globally more than of those reported here in the united states alone at the same time successive outbreaks of ebola have been occurring and we have measles once again on the rise and now vaccinederived polio circulating in countries where the virus had been previously thought to be eliminated so its really a staggering list of infectious diseases that have been occurring and continue to occur so clearly were at an important crossroads in terms of how we respond to these recurring hazards and infectious disease emergencies but today we get to zoom out a little bit and to examine factors that they may have all in common and to try to understand what may be driving thesethe recurrence of these events over and over again so over the past few years we have seen the consequences of social economic and racial inequities play out center stage these factors have underpinned not only our underlying vulnerabilities to infectious diseases but also how effectively we respond to them so thats what were going to talk about today and to help discuss these issues we are joined by two globally renowned experts who have a long history in working to address infectious disease threats and the disparities that accelerate them our first panelist is dr demetre daskalakis dr daskalakis is the deputy coordinator of the white house national monkeypox response prior to this role he served as director of cdcs division of hiv prevention and prior to that oversaw infectious diseases for the new york city department of health and mental hygiene which is one of the largest health departments in the nation and rivals the who in terms of staff and budgets so dr daskalakis is a leading national expert on many things but also in particular health issues affecting the lgbtqia communities and he has worked clinically for much of his career to focus on providing care for these communities we are also joined by dr jeremy youde who is the dean of the college of arts humanities and social sciences at the university of minnesota duluth previously dr youde was an associate professor in the department of international relations at australia national university in canberra dr youde is an internationally recognized expert on global health politics and he is a very prolific writer he has written five books and many chapters and countless articles i recently read a very compelling blog post by him on our own cfrs think global health so really excited to get both dr youde and dr daskalakiss perspectives on the issues in front of us so i will get the conversation started we have a lot of great attendees and well have time for questions but just to get the conversation going lets see here maybe first if i could turn to you dr demetre for those who havent been living in the monkeypox data as much as you have perhaps you could just give us a quick summary of where we are and where you see us being headed daskalakis thank you and thank you for having me im really excited to join jeremy and to be a part of this discussion so living in the data is in fact what i do so ill tell you so monkeypoxill give a little key bit of background just for everyone to be levelsetis an orthopoxvirus that is a virus that causes disease transmitted usually from animals to humans usually traditionally not a lot of humantohuman transmission this current outbreak in global in scale with cases reported internationally actually demonstrates pretty good humantohuman transmission often in the setting of close contact often associated with sexual activity and the majority of cases being among men who have sex with menthe vast majority over percent in the us at this moment we have cases i can tell you right up to the moment and so we continue to see increases in cases in the united states but were seeing a deceleration in the rate of increase so cases are stilling being logged we used to see kind of around four hundred cases per day were now more on the order of two hundred or below and continue to see that trend going in a good direction with more data imminently coming to the website of cdc later on today again just briefly the demographic majority male mainly men who have sex with menthe gay bisexual other men who have sex with men looking at the demographics at the beginning of the outbreak in may the majority of cases were among white men and now were seeing about percent of those cases are happening in latino or black men from the perspective of that measure as well weve seen a significant increase in vaccinations so we can talkwere going to talk more about that im sure but really with lots of strategies to increase vaccine supply we are now well over eight hundred thousand vaccines administered there is an inequity there as well the majority of vaccines are going to white men and were seeing latino men and black men in second and third place respectively in terms of vaccines administered jennifer i hope that thats a good situation summary to start off with nuzzo yeah great summary thank you so much that helped kind of bring everybody to the samesomewhat same level just a quick followup question for you there have been a lot of headlines about the important progress weve made and the fact that the global monkeyor sorrythe monkeypox cases seem to be coming down in terms of numbers question are you seeing similar trends for all demographics or are you concerned that perhaps the large numbers are hiding increased transmission in other groups daskalakis i had to fix the mute there we go so i think what weve seen is that the declines are looking to be even across population so thats good news again the vaccine equity is our main issue right now in terms of where werewhere thats stubborn right now and really thinking about strategies to improve that we had a lot of news today which im sure well be able to talk about some of the strategies that we have to address that but so i think theres no clear sign that the deceleration is different in different populations geographically however it is different and so thats i think one place wherethe jurisdictions that have had the greatest and longest experience with this outbreak so the most cases are also the jurisdictions that have access to the most vaccines so whether its because of behavior change that were seeing which is definitely something that we i imagine could talk about here as well or natural infections plus vaccineinduced immunity i think the places that have had more experience are showing deceleration faster so new york california texas and georgia are looking down while some of the places where the outbreak is newer and theyve also had less access and time for vaccines those places are showing an increase were going to get an update of this this week so this is based on data thats about a month old so soon were going to have a new view into how this deceleration or acceleration looks like jurisdiction by jurisdiction nuzzo great thank you maybe turn to you dr youde youve been an important voice about the global dimensions of the monkeypox crisis and im just curious where you think we are globally and i referenced in introducing you that piece that you wrote on think global health that i thought wasmade a quite compelling argument about the role of who and where you see the response needing to go do you want to maybe elaborate on those points for people who havent had a chance to read your article youde sure thank you for the question and thanks for organizing this im honored to be part of this event and picking up on some of what you were talking about and what demetre was just talking about as well we do see these inequities that exist especially when were looking worldwide the world health organization did declare monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern and while it doesnt necessarily come with automatic funding or programmatic resources it does raise the profile it does put this on the global health agenda and say this is something we need to be paying attention to in the piece i described it as the whos bat signal were sending out the message this is something that we need to pay attention to but one of the things i think is frustrating about the who response and just sort of the global communitys response to monkeypox in general is that monkeypox isnt a new disease this is a disease that weve known about in human cases since laurie garrett in her book the coming plague which came out in which is one of the books i think a lot of us who are probably about a similar age read in our early formative days as we were coming into global health and global health politicsshe talks about it in that book and if you look at the data that we have weve been seeing increases in monkeypox cases in humans in countries where monkeypox was endemic for about the last decade or so and sobut what really caught the international communitys attention was then when it came to the global north when it came to the industrialized countries and that helps to reinforce some of these questions about what is the nature of our real concern about global health is it about health in this very broad mandate like the world health organization has as part of its constitutional mandate to be this international coordinating body or is the sense that we in the global north want to keep the diseases from the global south coming to affect us and there are similar sorts of issues when were looking at vaccine equity and vaccine access when were looking globally and there have certainly been some problems here in the united states getting access to the vaccine but i was able to get vaccinated against monkeypox yeah i had to drive two and a half hours to minneapolis to do it but i was able to do it and i was able to arrange it people in countries where monkeypox is endemic have little to no access to these vaccines and it raises some of the questions then again about how the international system and the global health governance systems that we have in placehow they can address some of these equity challenges because in many ways outbreaks like monkeypox they glom onto the societal and social cleavages that exist and help to reinforce and exacerbate them but also provide this opportunity for us to really put some of our ideals and our promises around social justice around a cosmopolitan view of understanding that we are all healthier if we are all healthier and really put those into practice if we have the political and economic will to do so and thats wherethats one of the areas where i get a bit concerned right now i know were all exhausted talking about covid and about monkeypox and all of these sorts of outbreaks jennifer i know youve been doing a lot of this demetre obviously youve been on the frontlines ive been doing some of this work as well but when we lose that attention sometimes we lose then that motivethat momentum in the political system to try to address some of these challenges and these shortfalls that we have identified so i can be a critic of the world health organization but i also recognize that the world health organization is a creature of its member states and so its really incumbent upon the member states to really put some action behind their words and to say if we want to have a more effective response we need to build systems that are going to be able to respond better than this nuzzo thank you for that its a good segue to what i wanted to talk about next which is the title of this webinar being about social justice and those whove worked in public health the notion that social justice has a role to play in reducing our vulnerability to infectious disease is quite clear but im aware particularly over watchinglaughsthe national political debate over the last several years that those outside of public health may not recognize the connection between our vulnerability to infectious diseases and social justice and they may be dismissive of the idea that public health authorities should be engaged in the work of social justice so this is actually a question for you both and maybe reflect on monkeypox or your long experience of other infectious disease threats that youve worked to address and what would you say to folks that just dont understand why public health should be concerned with social justice and what role do you think it has to play going forward and maybe well turn back to you after demetre daskalakis do you want jeremy to go or do you want me to go first nuzzo go ahead youde go for it go for it ill let you start daskalakis all right so ill put my very strong hiv hat on because thats sort of where i come from and ill start that this is a fortyonea fortytwo almost yearold lesson that i think weve seen play out over and over again which is that really the social determinants of health are actually what drive infection so there are countermeasures that can work theres vaccines theres drugs theres preexposure prophylactics postexposure prophylactics it doesnt matter the social determinants are really what ultimately ends up blocking us from being able to implement the full vision of what we know we can from the perspective of medical technology and public health and so i think that at the end of the day that implementation piece is so critical so much technology can exist so many interventions can be designed but they sit on the shelf unless theres both the political and social will to move them forward and so i think i should put that hiv hat there for a second because in environments where there is less political and social will we tend to see hiv flourish and in places where there is social and political will we tend to see hiv not do so well from the perspectiveor in other words we will do well because of less incidents and prevalence so i think that sort of looking at that will is so critical ill give you a story from monkeypox which i think is really important that is about the sort of cdc response i got pulled in really early on before the first case actually hit the united states one of the very early conversations that we had with the response is that we need to expect that were going to have inequities that are going to be a part of this and i think thats based on lessons from covid and lessons from hiv and lessons from so many other infections i think we really worked to make equity the cornerstone of the response but even when you do that it is an allofsociety thing that needs to happen and not just something that is mediated simply by a public health department or a public health agency over youde and if i can take that public health hat and hiv hat that you had on and ill wear it myself i got into this line of work through working on hivaids issues in zimbabwe and south africa and seeing how those sorts of societal cleavages played a role but then also how infectious disease outbreaks and the spread of hiv was glomming into these other issues around democratization around building societies that were going to be equitable that were going to be able to fulfill the promises that governments had made to their populations and seeing how a disease like this was thwarting that progress so its something that is not just unique to the united states its something that we see globally from a very instrumental perspective we can say look public health is ultimately a weakest link public good everyone is still at risk so long as risks still exist so we need to reach out to those places which might have fewer resources which might not have the same sorts of ability to implement these sorts of programs because ultimately thats going to make us all healthier and i think theres elements and an important role for those sorts of instrumental views of public health but i also think about the recently passed paul farmer and his notion of public health especially his idea around the preferential option for the poor which was kind of a doubleedge sword because on the one hand he was saying look the people who are disenfranchised within societies those are the people who are the most vulnerable to these infectious disease outbreaks those are the people who are at the greatest risk but also we need to think about our programs we need to think about our interventions putting those people first thinking about equity putting that not as an afterthought or something that we think about five six seven steps down the road but it needs to be central and it needs to be core because again if were not taking equity seriously and were not really putting this into everything that were doing then were just reinforcing these sorts of divisions and again providing these opportunities and these outlets where diseases can thrive and so to just cosign what demetre was saying we can have all the technologies we want and i have all my criticisms about the way that the access to pharmaceuticals and drug interventions exist on a global level and questions about compulsory licensing and all these sorts of things those are all important but those are secondary in a lot of respects if we dont have the underlying core infrastructure in place and that core infrastructure even if its not touching us in a direct way does have an effect on our ability to stay healthy daskalakis could ithis is a fun one could i keep going a little bit longer on this nuzzo please do yeah daskalakis this is a great stimulative conversation on this and along with what ends up being both the foundation of the issue as well as the deeper foundation the way that all of these social issues interact with stigma like i think weve seen in fastforward with monkeypox like all the things that we saw with hiv and other infections and covidtoday for instancethis is a really good example so were giving the vaccines and right now theyre going on peoples forearms which means that literally some people will have a mark on their forearm so talking about stigmaliterally stigma and so we changed it so that individuals can elect to get the vaccine on their shoulder or on their back so we have people who want vaccines but are saying i dont want to be marked by this i dont want to have the sort ofsomeone know that i am someone whos potentially identifying myself as part of a group at risk and so it interacts exactly with the social determinants whether its poverty transportation racism all of it interacts in a way where these sort of more brasstacks economic issues interact with these very profound stigma issues and create barriers where even if you do have great accessill give an example again the ryan white program is really great access for people for hiv medication but we still dont have everybody in the countryinaudibleright so why is that its partially access but its also that the systems are built to sort of maintain structures of stigma and structures of inequity that are really hard to overcome even with things that provide access nuzzo so i was actually going to ask you about stigma so thank you for segueing to it and i seems to me thatand i dont have the hiv hat to wear like you both do but studying events that we typically think about in the field of health securitywhich is a field that sort of struggles to incorporate the fortyplus year lessons that hiv has learnedis that it is clear that stigma is an issue in nearly every single event any time we have particularly a new infectious disease or something thats unusual society seems to look for some group to blame but what it seems though is that while theres an increasing recognition of the importance of stigma it doesnt seem like we have great strategies for addressing it and i guess im wondering do you agree and also what practically can and should we be doing to address stigma i really saw us struggle with this i mean we had a recognition of it as being important in monkeypox but i feel that the absence of clear ways to deal with it really led us to struggle to talk about monkeypox and who was at risk and how people could protect themselves so what should we be doing going forward not just for monkeypox but future threats so that we dont get hobbled byfirst of all that we can minimize or tackle stigma but also dont get hobbled by it whoever wants to chime in laughs daskalakis so this is back to the hiv hat this is the tightrope that we walk every day in hiv and i think that the lesson actuallywell one of the first lessons thats important sort of sitting on the government side of the world is that government needs to lead and governmental public health needs to lead so that its messaging does not propagate stigma thats very important because whether people like governmental public health or not or have complaints about it ultimately people do look to governmental public healthlike cdc local health departmentsto really finetune their own messaging and then translate that messaging not just to another language but translate it so the populations that people work with actually understand and so i think monkeypox was actually a kind of exciting example where from the very beginning of the response it was a how can we take an antistigma stance in how we messaged it and so the balance really then depended on the data and so thats what was really important so it was starting with imperfect data and as the data became more and more clear making sure that the messaging evolved in a way that addressed what you were actually seeing epidemiologically without necessarilywithout creating a scenario where youre pinning infection a virus on a population let me give you an example since jennifer you say your hiv hat isnt as strong as ours so in the s when hiv started before it was hiv it was gayrelated immunodeficiency so that lesson was the lesson that was so important in the work that we did with monkeypox to start off by saying this is a virus that can affect anyone but were seeing this virus more in this population as opposed to saying this is this populations virus and so its leading by that example and its one of those things that we can raise up and say we have learned the lesson from this fortytwo years ago and were not doing it this way again and so with that said i think that theres a lot of strategies that can address stigma and a lot of that has to do with communications using trusted messengers so that has been a really important part of this as well because again working in public health i would love if everybody listened to public health data so providing good communications to individuals who are trusted messengers is really important and also part of the propagating stigma is also being clear about what data is things that we fully know and things that were still learning because that really allows that risk communication so that you dont overselect or too rapidly move a response into what population as opposed to being broad so as you learn more dataso for us our guidance started off in one place about safer sex and safer gathering as we were seeing that this was not moving throughout the different populations it got stronger and stronger and we really started the conversation by saying that this is guidance thats going to change as we learn more i think that we do have stigma mitigation strategies but stigmas a stubborn thing ill give it over to jeremy youde yeah i would agree with everything that you said and especially beinghaving that level of humility we are still learning about this things are going to change things are going to evolve but building those sorts of trusting relationships the other things that i would emphasize and i think these complement what you were saying quite well is empowering communities to speak to each other i think one of the things that weve seen here in the us around access to the monkeypox vaccine and the relatively high rates of vaccination that weve seen has been people talking to other people men who have sex with men talking to other men who have sex with men and this becoming part of the conversation even if it is something at the level of where were you able to get access to it when supplies are limited just building that sort of awareness within a community can be incredibly important i think its also important to make sure that we do have targeted messages not blaming messages but understand that the message that just says everyone is at risk for hiv or everyone is at risk for monkeypox ends up falling flat and doesnt really strike anyone and so having that sort of targeted outreach plays an important role but going back to this point about empowering the affected communities one of the most powerful things that i think that ive seen in the work that ive done is looking at the treatment action campaign in south africa and the work that they did especially in the late s and early s with the tshirts that just in huge bold letters across the chest said hiv positive and just having people going out there wearing those tshirts the image of nelson mandela wearing one of those treatment action campaign tshirts is just incredibly important because again its helping to remove some of that stigma its getting people who are trusted who are respected coming into the conversation ok if hes involved in this if hes saying this is an important issue maybe this is something that i need to be paying attention to but also just trying to make that sort of availability so that people are willing to share their experiences or talk about whats going on or what worked or what didnt work for them again these all play really important roles its never going to be perfect its something that we do need to keep at the forefront when these sorts of outbreaks happen and you see some of this in some of the broader conversation around even what we call diseases the names that we use the fact that there is a very strong move away from geographically located names for diseases because we dont want to stigmatize those particular communities or people who happen to be coming from those areas even something like that can play a really important role in helping people to think this is something that i need to take seriously if im in the united states i need to take this seriously even though were talking about something like monkeypox which isnt a geographic designator but there arent a lot of monkeys roaming around in minnesota but its something that they should be taking seriously because of these effects and these sorts of communitybased responses that help to try to destigmatize things encourage people to get access to vaccines or treatments or other sorts of options that are available to them and start to have those conversations to empower communities nuzzo thats great im going to turn over to questions and maybe participants can start putting their hands up but while thats happening and before i turn it over for that section of the conversation one last question to you both which is i am deeply worried that we respond to these events as these oneoffs we have an emergency we get emergency funding then perceptions of the emergency being over the funding disappears and its gone and we saw that happen with covid where the money went away and then states had to let go their pandemic hires and guess what they werent there when monkeypox happened so i guess the question is how do we move away from sort of seeing these as just oneoff emergencies and moving towards a role where we create a durable sort of permanent system thats in place to snap into action anytime theres an event which is happening

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/next-indictments-mueller-investigation,1050,187,congressman joaquin castro was frustrated and angry the texas democrat had just learned that the republicans were pulling the plug on the tortured bastardized house intelligence committee investigation into russian interference with the presidential election i just sawon the newsthat mike conaway is announcing that theyre wrapping up the investigation and the committee is just going to do a report castro a member of the committee says there are unanswered questions on collusion money laundering and obstruction not following any of these leads is an abject failure for the american people so thank god that bob mueller and the senate are still conducting their investigations the senate probes have plenty of their own partisan constraints mueller however has been barreling ahead in midfebruary the special counsel unveiled the indictment of russians and russianrelated companies charging them with waging a sprawling effort to plant thousands of bogus internet items and stage sham rallies in support of the trump campaign last months indictment though did more than identify alleged foreign criminals it laid a foundation for muellers next big move hes likely to target another batch of russians this time for hacking into the democratic national committee republican national committee and clinton campaign computersand outside investigators expect mueller will also name americans who may have helped the russians distribute the hacked materials castro has a unique window onto the special counsels possible course and sees careful calculation in its unfolding by indicting the russians first he says mueller laid the groundwork to show that there is this malignant force out there that was interfering with the american elections once everybody can appreciate that then he moves forward and says ok these are the americans that were helping these bad people possible bigname targetsall of whom have consistently denied conspiring with or aiding the russian electionmeddlinginclude roger stone jr the longtime trump adviser guccifer correspondent and gleeful dirty trickster cambridge analytica the datamining company and brad parscale who ran the trump campaigns socialmedia operation but mueller has so far proven adept at finding previously arcane operatives and forcing them to plead guiltyincluding foreignpolicy adviser george papadopoulos dutch attorney alex van der zwaan and rick gates the righthand man to paul manafort trumps former campaign chairman who has financial ties to eastern europe the big question here is whether the russians had any help in distributing the hacked material castro says and its really any guidance or direction or information sharing or data sharing with any americans these are very sophisticated folks so it doesnt take a lot of interaction necessarily to get them springing into action they dont need emails going back and forth you just need to point them in the right direction mueller is very good at uncovering people who had a role who are not obviousmiddlemen or obscure operators so i assume hes got those to come and getting those guys to turn on their superiors that could be key if youre looking just for a paper trail with the main cast of characters you may not find it but youve got all these underlings who may have been given a direction hey go figure this out parscale had people under him here in san antonio for the digital operation including helpers from twitter facebook and google weve heard that the trump campaign went through dozens of facebook embeds until they settled on people who they found loyal one house investigator says has mueller talked to them or to the google and twitter embeds seems logical the special counsels office and twitter declined to comment facebook and google did not return requests for comment whoever mueller names in the next indictment will also be contending with a new sinister extralegal worry the poisoning of former russian spy sergei skripal and his yearold daughter in england has sent chills through the ranks of witnesses and possible cooperatorsjust as it was intended to do when countries do a spy swap youre basically agreeing that were going to let you take this person and theyre allowed to live in your country says michael carpenter a former deputy assistant defense secretary with an expertise in russian affairs its not were going to let you take this person but were going to continue to try and kill them thats an unwritten rule of spycraft when it comes to the american presidential election however the putin regime looks increasingly unwilling to follow rules of any kind i suspect skripal was talking to christopher steele or someone on christopher steeles team carpenter says referring to the former british spy who in compiled the dossier of alleged ties between trump and russia that is why this got putins ire up and so thats why they went after him the kremlins no goal here is to intimidate anyone that may have talked to steele or any of his associates or who might cooperate with mueller yeah its pretty ominous its a really really bad development this post has been updated to restore part of a quotation from joaquin castro

to do with former russian spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia being poisoned with military grade novichok nerve agent in the wiltshire city vladimir chizhov told the bbcs andrew marr show russia did not stockpile the poison and that the porton down lab britains military research base was only eight miles from the cathedral city insinuating that may have been the source however the government has rebuffed his comments as nonsense the foreign office said there was not an ounce of truth in his implication the nerve agent could have been linked to porton down its just another futile attempt from the russian state to divert the story away from the facts that russia has acted in flagrant breach of its international obligations a spokesperson said theresa may told mps porton down identified the substance used on mr scribal and his daughter who remain in a critical but stable condition as being part of a group of military grade nerve agents known as novichok developed by russia earlier in

wrestling championships at the rose n bowl in rossendale lancashire pa mr chizhov said mr skripal could rightly be referred to as a traitor but from the legal point of view the russian state had nothing against him asked how the nerve agent came to be used in salisbury he said when you have a nerve agent or whatever you check it against certain samples that you retain in your laboratories and porton down as we now all know is the largest military facility in the united kingdom that has been dealing with chemical weapons research and its actually only eight miles from salisbury pobed about whether he was signalling porton down was responsible for the novichok toxin employed in the attack mr chizhov said i dont know i dont have any evidence of anything having been used he added i exclude the possibility of any stockpiles of any chemical weapons fleeing russia after the collapse of the soviet union but there were certain specialists including some scientists who today claim to be responsible for creating some nerve agents that have been whisked out of russia and are currently residing in the united kingdom mr chizhovs remarks come in the wake of a russian foreign ministry spokeswoman saying the uk was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent along with slovakia czech republic sweden or possibly america maria zakharova said a large number of exsoviet scientists had relocated to the west taking with them the technologies that they were working on on saturday russia ordered british diplomats to leave moscow within a week in response to britains decision to expel russian diplomats amid an escalating row between the two countries over the nerve agent attack russia has also said it will close the british council in russia which promotes cultural links between the countries and the british consulate in st petersburg foreign secretary boris johnson has said britain possesses evidence russia has been exploring nerve agent based assassinations and that the country has been stockpiling deadly chemical weapons in the last decade mr johnson specifically claimed britain has reason to believe moscow has been collecting novichok we actually have evidence within the last ten years that russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purposes of assassination but has also been creating stockpiling novichok mr johnson told the andrew marr show on sunday this comes after mr johnson said it was overwhelmingly likely russian president vladimir putin directed the use of the nerve agent on britains streets speaking during a visit to the battle of britain bunker museum in uxbridge alongside the polish foreign minister jacek czaputowicz mr johnson said our quarrel is with putins kremlin and with his decision and we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the uk on the streets of europe for the first time since the second world war mr johnsons move to publicly blame mr putin was understood to have been an intentional choice rather than an offthecuff gaffe it is believed mr johnson may have seen information which enabled the government to reach that conclusion however the russian government has denied any involvement in the attack the foreign secretarys comments were rebuked by mr putins spokesman dmitry peskov who said we have said on different levels and occasions that russia has nothing to do with this story any reference or mentioning of our president is nothing else but shocking and unpardonable diplomatic misconduct

salisbury was delivered in a liquid form the department for environment food and rural affairs has said a very small amount of the novichok nerve agent was used in the attack and the highest concentration was found at skripals house it emerged in a press briefing in the city work to decontaminate sites in salisbury affected by the nerve agent is beginning but will take months and involve

cordoned area of the cemetery where the remains of skripals wife and son lie has been reopened after extensive investigations and testing established that it was not contaminated the other nine potentially contaminated sites will remain secured work to clean each site will involve a process of testing removal of items which may have been contaminated chemical cleaning and retesting sites

show novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the soviet union in the s and s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons like other nerve agents they are organophosphate compounds but the chemicals used to make them and their final structures are considered classified in the uk the us and other countries the most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than vx the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents which include sarin tabun and soman novichok agents work in a similar way by massively overstimulating muscles and glands treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents namely with atropine diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes the chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in by vil mirzayanov a former russian scientist living in the us but the structures have never been publicly confirmed it is thought they can be made in different forms including as a dust aerosol the novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal after mixing two otherwise harmless components according to mirzayanov they are to times more toxic than conventional nerve agents photograph

in the coming days residents can expect to see cordons around the most public sites replaced with secure fencing backed by police patrols and security guards at certain points during decontamination

https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/syria-beginning-cold-war-180422075430047.html,1073,760,recent usled coalition strikes in response to an alleged chemical attack in douma a suburb of damascus had western analysts hoping for a tectonic change in washingtons policy on syria russia on the other hand was fearful that its previously unchecked influence in the battlefield was coming to an end the results of the joint us uk and french strikes on three suspected chemical facilities were ultimately underwhelming and are unlikely to serve as a deterrent against the further use of chemical weapons by bashar alassads regime that is not to say that us president donald trump blinked in the face of possible escalation with russia just two months earlier us warplanes attacked a proregime force in deir azzor reportedly killing dozens of russian mercenaries the russian government took days to acknowledge the attack and did not launch a military response while the april strikes had limited effect on the ground they did symbolically challenge the dominance of the russian military in syria what is more important they succeeded in transforming the conflict into a struggle between great powers as rhetorical tension escalated before the strikes un secretarygeneral antonio guterres himself pointed that out the cold war is back with a vengeance he said events of the past few months indeed have shown that the conflict in syria has gradually assumed the character of a cold warstyle struggle just like during the cold war of the th century today positive diplomatic engagement between russia and the us has been reduced to communication and coordination to avoid direct military confrontation in this sense instead of political diplomacy leading the way in bilateral relations it is the us and russian militaries that have now taken charge and are in constant contact coordinating deconfliction and deescalation militaries dominating diplomacy that the april western strikes on syria did not result in a decisive military operation by the us and its partners against assads military facilities and possibly iranianbacked forces was not surprising if one was to look at the conflict from a coldwar perspective articleguid in the days of the cold war tensions would build up very quickly but would also drop unexpectedly the cuban missile crisis the closest that the us and the soviet union came to an allout nuclear war is a case in point within days rhetoric escalated to threats of preemptive attacks as both sides put their armies on high alert only to quickly negotiate a deescalation agreement to remove threatening missile installations at least on two occasions civilian and military leadership on both sides chose not to respond to provocations eventually ending the episode with just one victim the pilot of a us u reconnaissance plane shot down by the cubans in syria today the military brass of both countries treads carefully hoping to let off steam despite washingtons promises of using nice and new and smart missiles and moscows threats of a swift retaliation the heated political rhetoric coming from both capitals that all too often slides into blunt threats does not match the reality of how the military establishment handles the crisis what we are witnessing in syria is a disconnect between the political and military dimensions of policymaking as sabrerattling has become a preferred mode of communication for diplomats while the military has become the voice of pragmatism and sanity political hostility on both sides has resulted in an enormous vacuum in usrussia relations which has been filled partially by their militaries they have seemingly maintained the only functioning platform for dialogue to avoid confrontation a new front for western confrontation with russia what makes the current crisis more explosive than any previous episode of diplomatic squabbles over syria is the fact that it is now firmly linked to diplomatic confrontation between russia and the west on other fronts this is evident in the decision of both france and the uk to participate in the us strikes on the syrian regime despite what british pm theresa may and french pm emmanuel macron said about the military strikes aiming to send a strong message against the use of chemical weapons this is not why paris and london joined washington in its operation articleguid recently diplomatic tensions between the uk and russia escalated after the poisoning of a former russian spy and his daughter in salisbury the expulsion of diplomats on both sides came as the climax of years of escalating diplomatic confrontation between the two countries frenchrussian relations have also soured in recent years macron has not shied away from demonstrating just how upset he was by what he perceived as russian meddling in the french elections that brought him to power during russian president vladimir putins visit to paris just days after the vote macron blasted russian media for their reporting on france and called it propaganda from the kremlins perspective france and the uk are becoming more involved in syria so that they channel their confrontation with russia away from home the idea is to have the pressure building up along the natos northeastern border released elsewhere in the relative safety of what is wrongly perceived in europe as a faraway conflict for moscow its struggle against the growing influence of nato at its borders was at the heart of its concerns during the cold war syria as a cold warera germany moscow and washington have come to realise that syria is the most convenient place to make a point to each other neither trump nor putin wants a military showdown in syria but with the islamic state of iraq and the levant isil almost entirely defeated in syria the antiterror campaign no longer produces the same political benefits as it used to just a year ago moscow and washington have lived off of the pr effects of their antiterrorist campaigns in syria long enough to understand that a lengthy process of political settlement of this conflict would not be as glorious as declarations of victory over isil articleguid with antiterror rhetoric exhausted syria has become hostage to a great power rivalry russia and the us will continue to seek maximisation of the returns on their investments in the syrian crisis and will continue to play off their diplomatic confrontations on its territory therefore it is not inconceivable that syria will take the role of cold warera germany it is likely that the two great powers along with their allies will use the country to set up new rules of the cold war game and new red lines the eastwestgermany divide devised by moscow and washington after world war ii may get a whole new meaning in the syrian context in this sense the global diplomatic confrontation between russia and the us will not bode well for syria and its people just as the cold war propagated proxy wars across the world ignoring selfdetermination rights of various peoples so is this diplomatic conflict likely to deny the syrian people the right to choose their own destiny the

story comment gift article share maybe he was a drug addict maybe he was suicidal maybe his british handlers decided to get rid of him maybe it was his motherinlaw ever since sergei skripal a former russian spy was poisoned in a provincial english town russian state media and russian officials have worked overtime to provide explanations the british government identified the poison as novichok a substance made only in russia a spokesman for the russian foreign ministry spokesman parried the claim by insisting that the czechs the slovaks and the swedes had it too and of course the british themselves one russian journalist opined that the assassination attempt was a rivals ploy to undermine russian president vladimir putin another blamed a ukraine attempt to frame russia the russian foreign minister declared the whole story was an attempt to distract from brexit advertisement the us has joined european allies in condemning a nerve agent attack likely carried out by russia opinion writers discuss on its only thursday video the washington post for his part putin when asked said russia had destroyed all its chemical weapons anyway the conspiracy theories came so thick and fast that some had to be retracted one russian scientist admitted that the soviet union had created novichok the interview was removed from the internet because it contradicted the foreign ministry spokesman who claims novichok never existed so far the british foreign office has tallied separate explanations for the assassination attempt with more presumably on the way no one was surprised by this barrage of contradictory claims this was exactly how the russian media and russian authorities responded after russianbacked troops in eastern ukraine shot down a malaysian passenger plane in killing everyone on board those explanations were just as varied and farfetched the ukrainians were trying to shoot down putin and missed the plane took off from amsterdam with dead bodies on board and they had the same aim to pollute the conversation and make the truth seem unknowable advertisement inside russia that campaign was a huge success a radio liberty journalist did a series of maninthestreet interviews in moscow soon after the crash almost everyone he asked told him that not only was it impossible to know what happened but also that nobody would ever know even some in the netherlands which had many passengers on the doomed flight have adopted nobody will ever know as an explanation for the crash even though dutch authorities and others have shown quite convincingly that it was shot down by a russian buk missile launched by the russianbacked separatists in eastern ukraine knowing that there is no point in rebutting each claim that would simply amplify them further the british foreign office decided to respond as one official told me by exposing the methodology of deceit its officials created a short video mocking the multiple russian explanations and they posted it on twitter and facebook with a statement accusing russia of offering denial distraction and threats instead of explanations they also sent samples of the skripals blood to a neutral international institution the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons for testing to confirm their conclusions but the campaign will continue in places that are much harder to see trust in the government is very low in large swaths of the british political spectrum the leader of the labour party jeremy corbyn has said that he still wants a definitive answer about the source of the nerve agent russian internet trolls are working hard on deepening this doubt while watching the debate about skripal ben nimmo of the atlantic councils digital forensic research lab noticed an online poll the creation of a procorbyn blogger with a large social media following it asked are you satisfied that theresa may has supplied enough evidence for us to be able to confidently point the finger of blame at russia when nimmo investigated he found large numbers of russian and consistently prorussian accounts answering the poll with an overwhelming no of course and then amplifying the result so that it appeared to have even more approval a minor thing but it was enough to convince the blogger that the mood of the public is starting to shift advertisement this is an example in miniature of the kinds of efforts that will be repeated again and again and its instructive since weve become fixated on the idea that russian disinformation is something that happens during election campaigns but it goes on all the time and coordinators respond to all kinds of circumstances and will evade official attempts to avoid them social media which makes it easy for anonymous trolls to have influence makes it easy to invent disinformation social divisions which diminish trust in authorities like the british foreign office help it spread what is needed now is a broader version of britains expose the methodology campaign one ambitious enough to reach below the surface that will take time and effort but unless we get started were doomed to live in a world where truth is defined by those who

units currently helping to investigate the poisoning of former gru agent sergei skripal home secretary amber rudd revealed at a time when a severe international terrorism threat hangs over britain i want to stress that they are proceeding with speed and professionalism we are putting in enormous resources to ensure that they have all the support that they need to do that said rudd after chairing a meeting of cobra the uks emergencies committee the uk believes that skripal and his daughter yulia were exposed to a nerve agent the two were found slumped on a bench outside a shopping center in wiltshire on march british police say that more than people in total were injured in the alleged attack which has been described by authorities as attempted murder both victims remain unconscious and in a lifethreatening condition following the incident authorities managed to collect pieces of evidence and have identified some witnesses to the crime rudd said noting that officers are taking part in the investigation the incident is getting so much attention that the government will be sending the armed forces to salisbury in order to handle potentially dangerous evidence in the area of the initial poisoning the bbc reported on saturday night that traces of a rare nerve agent thought to be used in the poisoning were found in a local branch of zizzi a chain restaurant and one of the five locations at the center of the police investigation on sunday public health england advised anyone who visited zizzi or the mill pub in salisbury on march or on the following day to wash the clothing they were wearing and to wipe clean personal items such as phones and handbags while there is no immediate health risk to anyone who may have been in either of these locations it is possible but unlikely that any of the substance which has come into contact with clothing or belongings could still be present in minute amounts and therefore contaminate your skin the government body said as quoted by reuters while rudd insisted that the investigators need to be given the space and time so that they can be absolutely clear when assigning blame for the attack british officials continue to

seemingly disregarding that the former spy with a tainted reputation could have made enemies since settling in britain in read more troops sent to salisbury after russian exdouble agent poisoning the key thing they need to be doing and they will be doing is to look at what skripal has been doing in his life since he has moved to the uk and i think this is where the motive for this attack is going to come from former mi agent annie machon told rt lets face it in intelligence terms he was a busted flush with no apparent interest to the russians it is usually the state level actors that have the capability of producing this sort of agent however in terms of who might have used it that is a different question machon said to say that if its a state made agent it must be a state attack is i think disingenuous at best people can get their hands on this sort of thing gangsters and criminals can get their hands on this sort of thing if theyve got the right money to pay for it while it remains unclear what exactly happened to skripal the british media continue to compare the incident with the infamous case of the former russian security officer alexander litvinenko who died from radioactive poisoning in litvinenkos death sparked a major crisis in britishrussian relations as many public figures in the west accused the russian government of alleged involvement moscow denied responsibility according to the times prime minister theresa may is a step away from naming russia as the chief suspect in the alleged attempted assassination now the paranoia in the uk in the skripal

skripal and his daughter yulia on british soil saying that the government has evidence russia has been creating and stockpiling the deadly nerve agent novichok within the past decade in remarks on sunday morning that broadened the allegations against russia over the nerve agent attack on the former spy and his daughter two weeks ago the foreign secretary said we actually have evidence within the last years that russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purpose of assassination but has also been creating and stockpiling novichok johnson who will brief the eu foreign affairs council on monday in the hope of securing a new joint statement blaming russia for the attack made the claims on the bbcs andrew marr show he was speaking in rebuttal of a counterclaim on the same programme from the russian ambassador to the eu vladimir chizhov that british agents might have used stockpiles from the chemical weapons facility at porton down which is about eight miles from salisbury chizhov said russia had nothing to do with the incident johnson described the porton down claim as satirical adding it was not the response of a country that really believes its innocent that really wants to engage in getting to the bottom of this matter chizhov flatly denied that russia had any stocks of novichok or had ever manufactured it johnsons allegation that britain had evidence of stockpiling and active work on a delivery system for its use in assassinations may account for the confidence the prime minister showed last week when she insisted after

there was evidence of a link with the kremlin and vladimir putin the foreign office is optimistic that eu ministers will agree after mondays briefing by johnson to a statement echoing the british blame on russia for the nerve agent attack and calling on russia to abide by its responsibilities under chemical weapons treaties in the first test of european attitudes to russia since putins reelection as president on sunday the eu will also express its shock that a military grade nerve agent has been used on the soil of an eu state the statement which is seen as a test of british diplomatic power ahead of brexit is not likely to specify any collective new measures the eu but will underline the need for eu to work harder on protecting itself from foreign interference by spies

northern europe including the baltics eu politicians are united in their opposition to the attack but some rightwing populists such as afd in germanyand la lega in italy flatly refuse to blame putin britain has been arguing in private with fellow eu states that an allegedly flippant russian refusal to engage with the allegations seriously indicates a country that does not care about its

that the french had led the call to end impunity for the use of chemical weapons at a special conference on the issue in paris in january johnson admitted in his bbc interview he had taken part in a

corbyns apparent reluctance to blame the russian state or putin for the poisonings insisting it was right that the leader of the opposition held the government to account he added in remarks more hostile towards russia than any made by corbyn but theres a pattern of people being murdered here so therefore it leads you to the conclusion that putin has questions to answer because it is highly likely this could be a state execution corbyn has not made any similar allegations in an article in the guardian on friday he warned against rushing ahead of the evidence i have seen clear thinking in an international crisis overwhelmed by emotion and hasty judgments too many times he said meanwhile there appeared to be a coordinated attempt to close down a party row that has severely threatened

this story comment gift article share londongrad is the nickname not entirely affectionate that wealthy russians have bestowed upon britains capital the term doesnt just designate a physical place though many russians do indeed live here londongrad is more properly a state of mind encompassing not only the nonresident owners of large houses in kensington but also the british institutions banks law firms accountants private schools art galleries and even the conservative party fundraisers that have gone out of their way to accommodate them londongrad can be a place of bizarre contrasts a few years ago i found myself standing on the sideline of a schools rugby pitch watching small boys tackle one another in the mud all around me were the green fields of england cows were grazing in the middle distance huddled on the sidelines a group of men presumably parents of some of the small boys were arguing loudly in russian about large sums of money equally weird was a walk with friends in rural hampshire past the gates of a vast estate although registered to a company called skymist holdings the house was in fact owned by elena baturina a russian business executive who became enormously rich while her husband yuri luzhkov was the mayor of moscow the locals knew the owners identity because they had seen luzhkov at the pub advertisement russia will expel british diplomats and close the british consulate as ties worsen after sergei skripal and his daughter were targeted with a nerve agent video reuters these incongruities were produced by a tacit deal for two decades the british establishment has agreed not to think too hard about where the russians got their money how cash was stolen from the state recycled in the west then used to help bring vladimir putin and his exkgb colleagues to power in return the russians spent a lot of that money in britain to the benefit of the british the relationship has at times been extraordinarily complicit there was the london flotation of rosneft the oil company created from the stolen assets of another oil company whose owner had been arrested and sent to prison in siberia the prospectus did actually warn potential purchasers of the risks crime and corruption could create a difficult business climate in russia but the sale went forward reaped rewards for those who arranged it and established a principle stolen goods can become legal as long as the london financial establishment approves now the relationship is at a low point the british were shocked or should i say shocked shocked to discover that russian operatives treat all of britain like londongrad for a second time they appear to have used a dangerous chemical agent in an attempt to murder one of their compatriots on british soil on wednesday prime minister theresa may eloquently condemned russia for its use of a militarygrade nerve agent declared she would expel russian diplomats and charged that the russian government has demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events advertisement but that means she doesnt understand the profundity of the problem that the russian government treats britain with disdain because the russian government thinks it has bought the british elite worse than that it may be right on the day of mays speech gazprom the statecontrolled energy company that is the source of wealth for so many of russias leaders issued an eightyear nearly billion eurobond the russian embassy sent out a tweet announcing that the gazprom sale was oversubscribed and added a punchline business as usual on

https://www.rt.com/news/421979-west-accusations-no-facts-skripal/,1091,770,from the mh case to chemical attacks in syria to the skripal poisoning the west only throws accusations against russia without giving any proof the russian foreign ministry said adding that such an approach will not work the western countries have never presented proper evidence to substantiate their claims in any of the recent highprofile international incidents including the downing of the malaysia airlines jet over eastern ukraine or the alleged instances of the use of chemical weapons in syria they however always treated their own statements as ultimate truth the director of the russian foreign ministrys department for nonproliferation arms control vladimir ermakov said at a meeting with the representatives of foreign embassies in moscow his words come in response to yet more accusations and threats issued by western countries in relation to the poisoning of the former russian doubleagent sergei skripal and his daughter although the ambassadors from the uk france and the us did not bother to attend the meeting with the russian foreign ministrys officials over the skripal case they sent their representatives with harshly worded statements a us representative warned that washington will hold russia accountable for its illegal actions reiterating that the us stands in complete solidarity with uk his french colleague also expressed the full solidarity of france with the uk following what he called a chemical attack that was conducted on its territory the diplomat also asked if russia would trust the outcome of an investigation conducted jointly by the british experts and the representatives of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw the opcw convention and the opcw itself do not provide opportunities to give assessment to what exactly happened in salisbury the russian diplomat responded adding that a deeper expert assessment would be needed anyway for russia to be able to come to any conclusions real facts and ultimate truth investigations ermakov said that the credibility of the opcw investigations conducted in close cooperation with the west only has been severely undermined by the international probe conducted in syria we know how some mechanisms that you consider to be reliable worked in syria it was a total fake he added referring to the joint investigative mechanism jim of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw which was tasked with investigating the instances of the alleged chemical weapons used in syria russia has repeatedly criticized the jim for failing to produce objective reports on chemical attacks including the april incident in the village khan shaykhun it also slammed the probe for relying on cherrypicked facts and accounts by partisan sources as for novichok there was never a scientific program under such a codename in the russian federation rt march after the jim mandate had expired in november moscow proposed to establish an objective investigative mechanism to probe all allegations of chemical attacks in syria based on impeccable and irrefutable data the proposal was however immediately dismissed by washington read more us rejects moscowproposed un mechanism to probe syria chemical attacks based on facts those who want to investigate something without presenting the real facts and then declare the results of such an investigation as the ultimate truth apparently have some malign intentions ermakov said he then added that such schemes would not work in the case of russia opcw no member states known to possess novichokclass nerve agents rt march do you want to investigate the skripal case we are ready for a joint investigation if you do not then it is a different question entirely the director of the department for nonproliferation arms control said he also pointed out that cctv cameras are mounted almost everywhere in the uk and the british authorities must have had records showing what exactly happened in salisbury you have everything recorded share the evidence and we will help with the investigation the diplomat added he then drew attention to the fact that it is not the first time that the western powers have refused to disclose evidence that could be crucial for a highprofile international investigation but could prove undesirable for the agenda promoted by the west mh shadow accusations against moscow repeated but hard evidence still missing rt march does the us really have no data about who exactly shot down that boeing ermakov rhetorically asked referring to the downing of malaysia airlines flight mh in you did have everything recorded you had a satellite monitoring the situation over there he added responding to the comments of the us diplomat during the meeting he then said that the us preferred to stay silent and never shared its data following the incident despite the fact that the investigation into the attack on the jet became de facto deadlocked the diplomat also drew attention to that fact that the west blamed russia even before the boeing hit the ground six months after the inquiry into the flight mh crash in ukraine had entered its fourth year the dutch investigators have not provided any tangible results the probe has been recently extended for yet another year the western politicians meanwhile continue to blame russia for the incident mh shadow accusations against moscow repeated but hard evidence still missing in the meantime ermakov said that repeated accusations issued against russia show the wests attempts to hide from the current international reality instead one should think about how to build new international relations in a world that has come a long way from the unipolarity of the s when almost everything was being decided in washington he said these times have passed away we need to develop international relations which would be based on the current reality he added think your friends would be interested share this story
