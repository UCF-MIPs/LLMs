WASHINGTON — The Trump administration expelled 60 Russian diplomats on Monday and ordered Russia’s consulate in Seattle to close, as the United States and European nations sought to jointly punish Moscow for its alleged role in poisoning an ex-spy in Britain.

Senior Trump administration officials said all 60 Russians were spies working in the U.S. under diplomatic cover, including a dozen at Russia’s mission to the United Nations. The officials said the administration was taking the action to send a message to Russia’s leaders about the “unacceptably high” number of Russian intelligence operatives in the U.S

The expelled Russians will have seven days to leave the U.S, said the officials. They weren’t authorized to be identified by name and requested anonymity. They added that the Seattle consulate is a counter-intelligence concern because of its proximity to a U.S. Navy base.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the actions would make the U.S. safer by “reducing Russia’s ability to spy on Americans and to conduct covert operations” that threaten U.S. national security.

“With these steps, the United States and our allies and partners make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences,” Sanders said.

The move was one of the most significant actions President Donald Trump’s administration has taken to date to push back on Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Less than a week ago, Trump congratulated Putin by phone for his re-election but didn’t raise the spy case, renewing questions about whether the U.S. president is too soft on the Kremlin.

The U.S. actions came as more than a dozen nations, including those in Russia’s neighborhood, were expected to announce similar steps to reduce Russia’s diplomatic presence in their countries or other actions to punish Moscow. Poland summoned Russia’s ambassador for talks, and its foreign ministry was among several in Europe planning news conferences later Monday.

Britain has already expelled 23 Russian diplomats, accusing them of being undeclared intelligence agents, which led Russia to expel the same number of British diplomats. The European Union has already recalled its ambassador to Russia.

The steps on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean add to a serious escalation of tensions between Russia and the West that has been building since the March 4 poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer convicted of spying for the U.K., and his daughter, Yulia. The two remain in critical condition and unconscious. A policeman who responded to their home was also injured.

Britain has accused Moscow of perpetrating the attack using a Soviet-developed nerve agent known as Novichok. The U.S., France and Germany have agreed it’s highly likely Russia was responsible.

Russia’s government has denied responsibility and has blasted Britain’s investigation into the poisoning. There was no immediate reaction from Russia on Friday to the U.S. announcement.

The U.S. actions came as more than a dozen nations, including those in Russia’s neighborhood, were taking similar steps to reduce Russia’s diplomatic presence in their countries or other actions to punish Moscow.

Poland, Germany and Lithuania are among the European countries announcing they are expelling Russian diplomats over the poisoning of Skripal.

Germany and Poland both say they have asked four Russian diplomats to leave, while in Lithuania, three Russian diplomats were ordered to leave.

The German foreign ministry said in a statement that the move was part of a joint European response to the case of ex-spy Sergei Skripal.

It said “the expulsion of four diplomats is a strong signal of solidarity with Great Britain and signals the resolve of the Germany government not to leave attacks against our closest partners and allies unanswered.”

The ministry added that the move was also a response to the recent cyberattacks against German government networks, “which according to information so far is highly likely to be attributable to Russian sources.”

European Union chief Donald Tusk says 14 member nations are expelling Russian diplomatic staff over the poisoning of Skripal in Britain.

Tusk said Monday that there may be additional measures including further expulsions in the coming days and weeks.

In coordinated announcements of expulsions on Monday, the Czech Republic said it is kicking out three staffers from the Russian embassy. Andrej Babis calls the measure an expression of solidarity with Britain.

The Netherlands said it is expelling two Russian intelligence officers, while Estonia said it was expelling the Russian defense attache. The Italian Foreign Ministry announced that Italy would expel two Russian diplomats assigned to the embassy within a week",anti-russian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/sergei-skripal-spy-poisoning-russia-uk-sanctions-eu-lack-consensus,137,123,"The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has said he is encouraged by the response from friends willing to rally to the UK cause over the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. But EU officials warned privately that the bloc’s existing consensus on further sanctions against Russia has already been cracking, and it may be impossible to forge collective agreement on new measures.

One official said the best that may happen is that the EU resolves to stick to its existing sanctions position rather than see it diluted.

Following a round of diplomatic phonecalls coordinated with Number 10, Johnson had been buoyed by support overnight from the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, only to find that Donald Trump had fired him after repeated run-ins.

Trump himself said on Tuesday that he would speak to Theresa May about the poison attack, after facing criticism for not swinging clearly behind the UK view that the Russian government was either responsible for the attack or for failing to control its nerve agent stocks. “It sounds to me that it would be Russia based on all the evidence they have,” he said. “As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.”

Johnson was also claiming support from the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian. Guy Verhofstadt, president of the European parliament and an advocate of conditional engagement with Russia, said: “We stand shoulder to shoulder with the British people.” Support also came from the European commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans.

No EU country has so far committed itself to further sanctions against Russia if the UK declares the Russian state had acted unlawfully on British soil.

Timeline Poisoned umbrellas and polonium: Russian-linked UK deaths Show September 1978 Georgi Markov In one of the most chilling episodes of the cold war, the Bulgarian dissident was poisoned with a specially adapted umbrella on Waterloo Bridge. As he waited for a bus, Markov felt a sharp prick in his leg. The opposition activist, who was an irritant to the communist government of Bulgaria, died three days later. A deadly pellet containing ricin was found in his skin. His unknown assassin is thought to have been from the secret services in Bulgaria. November 2006 Alexander Litvinenko The fatal poisoning of the former FSB officer sparked an international incident. Litvinenko fell ill after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium. He met his killers in a bar of the Millennium hotel in Mayfair. The pair were Andrei Lugovoi – a former KGB officer turned businessman, who is now a deputy in Russia’s state Duma – and Dmitry Kovtun, a childhood friend of Lugovoi’s from a Soviet military family. Putin denied all involvement and refused to extradite either of the killers. March 2012 German Gorbuntsov The exiled Russian banker survived an attempt on his life as he got out of a cab in east London. He was shot four times with a silenced pistol. He had been involved in a bitter dispute with two former business partners. November 2012 Alexander Perepilichnyy The businessman collapsed while running near his home in Surrey. Traces of a chemical that can be found in the poisonous plant gelsemium were later found in his stomach. Before his death, Perepilichnyy was helping a specialist investment firm uncover a $230m Russian money-laundering operation, a pre-inquest hearing was told. Hermitage Capital Management claimed that Perepilichnyy could have been deliberately killed for helping it uncover the scam involving Russian officials. He may have eaten a popular Russian dish containing the herb sorrel on the day of his death, which could have been poisoned. March 2013 Boris Berezovsky The exiled billionaire was found hanged in an apparent suicide after he had spent more than decade waging a high-profile media battle against his one-time protege Putin. A coroner recorded an open verdict after hearing conflicting expert evidence about the way he died. A pathologist who conducted a postmortem examination on the businessman’s body said he could not rule out murder. December 2014 Scot Young An associate of Berezovsky whom he helped to launder money, he was found impaled on railings after he fell from a fourth-floor flat in central London. A coroner ruled that there was insufficient evidence of suicide. But Young, who was sent to prison in January 2013 for repeatedly refusing to reveal his finances during a divorce row, told his partner he was going to jump out of the window moments before he was found.

4 March 2018 Skripal poisoning Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were were found unconscious on a bench in the Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury after 'suspected exposure to an unknown substance' which was later identified as chemical weapon novichok. In the aftermath Theresa May blamed Vladimir Putin and expelled 23 Russian diplomats who were suspected of spying. Two Russian men using the identities Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov were named as suspects. They appeared on Russian TV to protest their innocence.

The Skripals survived. However a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after spraying novichok on her wrists from a fake Nina Ricci perfume bottle converted into a dispenser, which had been recovered from a skip by her partner Charlie Rowley. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

In a major test of UK diplomatic heft in a post-Brexit era, the UK has been putting out feelers to sense what countries would be prepared to do in a show of solidarity.

In a sign that some EU countries will put the emphasis on the UK to put its own house in order, rather than agree new collective steps, Norbert Röttgen, chairman of Germany’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said the case showed the need to target the fudged boundary between the Russian state security apparatus and organised crime. “The case should be a reason for Britain to examine its open stance towards Russian capital of dubious origin,” Röttgen said.

MEPs were questioning whether the UK would use new legislation – such as unexplained wealth orders that are included in the Criminal Finance Act 2017 – to challenge some Russian millionaires living in London. Ministers have insisted the orders will be used but say they cannot risk using them in a way that undermines the UK’s reputation for judicial independence.

Röttgen is seen as close to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who on Monday had expressed the hope that the re-election of Vladimir Putin as president this weekend would represent an opportunity for Europe to propose a fresh start with Russia over how to handle Ukraine and the annexation of Ukraine.

Discussing the EU’s approach to sanctions, one official said the Salisbury poisoning episode “makes it more likely we keep what we have got. The consensus has been beginning to crack”.

Hardly any frontrank politician in Italy, for instance, favours sanctions against Russia even if some oppose them simply because they are seen as ineffective.

The EU has recently become more focused on the threat posed by Russia in the western Balkans as well as the continued occupation of parts of Georgia, where deaths occur most days. The criticism of Russian behaviour in the Balkans, especially by the US, raises hackles in parts of the region. On Monday the Serbian defence minister, Aleksandar Vulin, derided recent US warnings of Russian interference in the Balkans as some of the most dangerous statements made since the western military alliance bombed the country in 1999.

Inside Nato high command support for the UK position is strong, but the presence of Turkey, increasingly an ally of Russia in Syria, makes decisive action harder to coordinate.

The episode underlines the extent to which UK’s post-Brexit foreign and security relations with the EU remain unresolved. Britain as a third party would not be automatically consulted on common foreign and security policy, including further sanctions coordination, but both sides have been deferring talks until the outline of a trade deal becomes clearer.

The level of EU engagement with UK requests for help over Russia may influence the atmosphere of the Brexit talks. Speaking in London, Nathalie Tocci, special adviser to the EU head of external affairs, Federica Mogherini, said the scope for a win-win deal on foreign policy and security for both the UK and the EU was higher than in any other area, adding that the bargaining power was more balanced in this field than in any other.

Some EU officials have suggestedthat even in a transition period, when the UK is confined to the role of rule taker, it might be possible to construct a pilot in which the UK defence contribution remained integrated, and the country was fully consulted on decision-making.",anti-russian,0

A Russian Foreign Ministry official has suggested Britain may have poisoned former spy Sergei Skripal.

“Logic suggests” the UK might have orchestrated the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, claimed Vladimir Yermakov, head of the ministry’s non-proliferation and arms control department.

In provocative comments, he said the only alternative conclusion was that UK authorities were “not able to provide protection from... a terrorist attack on their soil”.

The UK Foreign Office has accused Moscow of a “campaign of disinformation” over the poisoning of Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were found unconscious on a bench in the Wiltshire city on 4 March. The Kremlin continues to deny any involvement in the attack, carried out with a Soviet-era military-grade chemical.

“Logic suggests that there are only two possible things,” Mr Yermakov told a meeting with foreign ambassadors in Moscow.

“Either the British authorities are not able to provide protection from such a, let’s say, terrorist attack on their soil, or they, whether directly or indirectly – I am not accusing anyone – have orchestrated an attack on a Russian citizen”.

He told foreign envoys invited for a briefing that Britain was ”hiding facts” and that key evidence might “disappear.”

The UK’s ambassador to Laurie Bristow shunned the meeting amid heightened tensions between London and Moscow.

On Tuesday 23 Russian diplomats left the UK after being expelled from the country by Prime Minister Theresa May. In response, the Kremlin ordered 23 British envoys to leave Russia by Saturday.

Mr Yermakov’s remarks echoed unsubstantiated conspiracy theories which blamed Britain for attacking Mr Skripal, a former Russian double agent who was given refuge in the UK after selling secrets to MI6.

Some have accused Britain itself of launching the attack as a “false flag” to smear Russia, damage Mr Putin ahead of elections or even to distract from a grooming scandal in Telford.

Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s representative at the UN Security Council, has claimed the “most probable source” of the Novichok chemical used in the attack was one of several countries that had been carrying out research on nerve agents since the 1990s, including the UK.

But two Russian scientists on Tuesday contradicted the Kremlin’s insistence that there was never a state programme to make the deadly nerve agent, both independently stating that they were involved in the poison’s creation at chemicals weapons laboratories in the Soviet era.

The British Foreign Office said there was “no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable”.

“The onus remains on the Russian state to account for their actions and to comply with their international obligations,” it added.

“Instead of providing an explanation for the Salisbury incident, Russia has launched a campaign of disinformation.”

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Moscow had constructed “a haystack of lies” to cover its involvement in the poisoning.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for ”transparency from Russia” and emphasised her country’s solidarity with Britain in a speech in speech in Berlin on Wednesday.

She said that “a lot of evidence points to Russia and so transparency from Russia is required to quell the suspicion.”

Ms Merkel added: “I would be happy if I didn’t have to name Russia here, but we can’t disregard evidence because we don’t want to name Russia.”",anti-russian,0
https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/mattis-responds-ex-spy-poisoning,181,156,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The poisoning in Britain of a former Russian spy and his daughter amounts to “attempted murder” by the Russian government and furthers a pattern of Russian efforts to divide the U.S.-led Western alliance, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Tuesday.

In remarks to reporters at the Pentagon, Mattis said the March 4 attack in Salisbury, England, involved the “pretty obvious” use of a chemical agent. He did not identify the agent, beyond calling it a “weapon of mass destruction,” but the British government says it was Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent. Mattis said Salisbury was the first chemical weapon attack in Europe since World War II and provided a fresh example of Russian misbehavior.

Mattis, a retired Marine general and former senior NATO commander, said he could recall a time when the U.S. and Russian militaries were training together for international peacekeeping missions amid hope of a post-Cold War partnership.

“That regrettably, by Russia’s choice, is now a thing of the past,” he said. “Russia has chosen to be a strategic competitor, even to the point of reckless activity,” referring to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter, Yulia, who are hospitalized in critical condition. “That’s the only thing it can be called to the innocent people in Salisbury who were exposed, and possibly to the extent of being murdered by this stuff.”

Pressed to be more specific in his accusation, Mattis said: “Attempted murder of a man and his daughter. How’s that for starters?”

Asked whether this amounted to an act of war, Mattis said it is part of a pattern of Russian actions that President Vladimir Putin apparently believes can be plausibly denied. Mattis cited as examples Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its military intervention in eastern Ukraine, as well as its interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

“They are doing things they think are deniable,” he said. “So they’re trying to break the unity of the Western alliance,” referring to NATO, which joined in the denunciation of the Salisbury attack, announcing Tuesday that it will expel seven staffers from the Russian mission in Brussels and will deny the pending accreditation requests of three other workers there.

More than 20 countries on Monday announced they were expelling a total of more than 130 Russian diplomats, including 60 kicked out by the United States, in response to the Salisbury incident. On Tuesday, Australia said it was kicking out two Russian diplomats whom he described as undeclared intelligence officers. They have been given seven days to leave.

Mattis highlighted NATO’s response, which carried undertones of Cold War-like tension, but declined to say what role he believes Putin had in the Salisbury attack and other actions designed to divide the West.

“I won’t speculate. Certainly he’s responsible as the head of state. We all can draw our own conclusions,” he said.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday spoke by phone with the leaders of two key NATO allies — French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The White House said that in both conversations the leaders expressed support for the West’s response to the Salisbury poisoning, including NATO’s expulsion of Russians.

The U.S. sees Russia increasingly as an adversary, although in Syria the two countries are still in daily contact to prevent unintended military clashes as Russian forces support President Bashar Assad and U.S. forces back anti-Islamic State fighters. Mattis said high-level U.S.-Russian contacts in recent days helped defuse a potential clash between what he called Russian mercenaries and U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces, who are fighting IS remnants in the Deir el-Zour area of eastern Syria.

Mattis said when these “Russian elements” got too close to the U.S.-backed forces on the east side of the Euphrates River, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, got on the phone with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov. As a result the Russians pulled backed and the U.S.-allied fighters fell back “slightly,” Mattis said.

“We think the potential for a clash there, thanks to the Russian direction to this group, has been reduced,” Mattis said.",anti-russian,0

Leaders of the four biggest powers in the Western world have taken the unprecedented step of issuing a joint demand that Russia should fall into line following the Salisbury nerve agent attack.

The US, France and Germany backed Theresa May’s assessment and issued a unified statement that they believe Moscow was behind the release of a Russian-made Novichok chemical weapon in the Wiltshire city.

Donald Trump also announced new sanctions to punish Russia for meddling in elections and cyber attacks, heaping pressure on Vladimir Putin and making clear the West is taking any misconduct seriously.

​Nato’s leading council was on Thursday night set to be briefed on the Salisbury incident, which left ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal, his daughter and a British police officer all in a serious condition, while across the Channel demands for a joint-EU response gathered momentum ahead of next week’s European summit.

Downing Street said the “quad” of Western nations would now continue to work together to increase pressure on Moscow in a bid to rein in what the nations called “irresponsible Russian behaviour”.

The statement was a boost for the Prime Minister, with some doubting whether White House and Élysée Palace administrations that are both trying to build links with Russia would give full-throated support to her position.

But after frenetic diplomatic activity, including telephone calls between the Prime Minister and the other leaders, the statement came saying that Ms May, Mr Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel “abhor the attack that took place”.

✕ Donald Trump: It 'looks like' Russia responsible for nerve agent attack

Statements from the quad countries have come before but only at foreign minister level, in July 2017 on Iran’s space launch and on Syria’s use of chemical weapons at the end of last year.

But the leaders coming together for the first time said in their statement: “The United Kingdom briefed thoroughly its allies that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack.

This use of a military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, constitutes the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War. It is an assault on UK sovereignty The UK, US, France and Germany

“We share the UK assessment that there is no plausible alternative explanation, and note that Russia’s failure to address the legitimate request by the UK Government further underlines its responsibility.

“We call on Russia to address all questions related to the attack in Salisbury. Russia should in particular provide full and complete disclosure of the Novichok programme to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.”

The nations highlighted that the Salisbury attack was the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War, adding that it was “an assault on UK sovereignty”, a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law.

✕ Theresa May: 'We do hold Russia culpable for this brazen, brazen act and despicable act'

Arguing that the incident threatened the security “of us all”, the group said: “Our concerns are also heightened against the background of a pattern of earlier irresponsible Russian behaviour.”

The US move to impose new unilateral sanctions on Russia served further to underline how the Salisbury attack has become a lynchpin, off which the West is pushing Russia harder over its international activities.

Nineteen people and five Russian organisations were targeted by Washington’s measures in what amounts to the most significant action against Moscow since Mr Trump took office.

The sanctions will block those affected from travelling to America, freeze any assets they have in the country and bar US companies from working with them.

In Washington, 40 US Congressmen signed a letter to Ms May pledging “full support” in tackling the Kremlin over Salisbury.

The Prime Minister’s security adviser Mark Sedwill was set to brief the North Atlantic Council – Nato’s principle political body – on Thursday evening about developments in the Skripal investigation.

Former Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said ahead of the meeting that “anything short of full solidarity with the UK will be considered a victory by the Kremlin”.

Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, will meet with EU leaders next week to discuss the Salisbury incident, but calls for a unified approach are already building.

✕ Vladimir Putin approached by BBC reporter to ask about Sergei Skripal poisoning

Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called on Mr Tusk to “coordinate a response from the 28 member states of the European Union”.

The leaders of Canada and Australia have already offered their backing for the UK’s position on Salisbury.

London was nonetheless braced for the Russian response to Ms May’s dramatic announcement on Wednesday that she would expel 23 diplomats from the country’s UK embassy, who she claimed were part of an “espionage network”.

Ms May, who personally visited Salisbury on Thursday, also used a statement in the Commons to announce asset freezes and new powers to detain people suspected of “hostile activity”.

The Russian Tass news agency reported that Vladimir Putin will personally choose the retaliatory measures Moscow takes against the UK following Ms May’s announcements, with tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions likely.

Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “A final decision [on retaliatory measures] will, of course, be made by the Russian President. There is no doubt that he will choose the variant that best of all corresponds to the interests of the Russian Federation.”

He said that Russia is “perplexed and does not comprehend the British leadership’s stance” and insisted the “accusations are unsubstantiated”.",anti-russian,0
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/europe/yulia-skripal-russia.html,225,189,"Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, released a statement on the organization’s report, saying, “There can be no doubt what was used and there remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible — only Russia has the means, motive and record.”

Mr. Skripal, 66, is a former Russian military intelligence officer who has lived for several years in Salisbury; his daughter, 33, lives in Russia and was visiting him at the time of the poisoning.

“The attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury was the first time a nerve agent had been deployed in Europe since the Second World War,” Mr. Fleming said.

On Wednesday night, the Metropolitan Police released a statement attributed to Ms. Skripal, turning down a Russian offer of consular assistance, adding another irritant to worsening relations with Moscow. Russia has repeatedly requested access to Ms. Skripal, accusing Britain of improperly denying it contact with one of its citizens.

“I have been made aware of my specific contacts at the Russian Embassy, who have kindly offered me their assistance in any way they can,” Ms. Skripal was quoted as saying in the statement. “At the moment, I do not wish to avail myself of their services, but if I change my mind, I know how to contact them.”

Russian officials have ridiculed British accusations, while floating an array of theories, some of them contradictory, about what happened in Salisbury. They claim that neither the Soviet Union nor Russia ever had a novichok program, that other former Soviet bloc countries could have supplied the novichok, that the toxin involved was not novichok, and that the British might have poisoned the Skripals.

The statement attributed to Ms. Skripal, 33, met with derision from the Russian authorities, who described it as “an interesting read,” pointedly noting that there was no way to verify it, and suggesting that the remarks contained more questions than answers.",anti-russian,0

Theresa May will ask European leaders to examine Britain’s response to the use of a nerve agent against a Russian double agent and his daughter in Salisbury and step up their own measures when they meet in Brussels on Thursday.

The prime minister will brief leaders over dinner at the European council summit, where she will stress a pattern of aggressive Russian behaviour. “The challenge of Russia is one that will endure for years to come,” she will say. “As a European democracy, the UK will stand shoulder to shoulder with the EU and Nato to face these threats together. United, we will succeed.”

Q&A Does Russia present a credible threat to the UK? Show Russia has been a useful bogeyman since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. UK military chiefs were spooked when Russia, during an intervention in Ukraine, used a combination of drones and artillery to destroy Ukrainian armour, and raised questions about whether the UK would be able to do much better than the Ukrainians in similar circumstances. The UK is far enough away for Russia not to pose a territorial threat. But UK forces are deployed in the Baltic states along with US and other Nato forces as a deterrent in the unlikely event of a Russian landgrab.

Russia does present a threat through hybrid warfare, or the use of deniable acts of disruption – primarily cyber-attacks on the UK that could disrupt essential services or interference in the democratic process, such as in elections. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

It is understood conversations over the coming weeks will include the UK making the case that countries should take similar action to expel Russian diplomats believed to be undisclosed intelligence agents, after the UK expelled 23 this week. Downing Street believes the expulsions have now severely limited Russia’s intelligence capacity and is understood to be considering further expulsions if further undisclosed intelligence agents are discovered.

A senior Whitehall official said that Russia “has shown itself to be a strategic enemy, not a strategic partner”, pointing to a pattern of behaviour including cyber-attacks on countries including Germany, the US and Denmark and aggression in Syria and Ukraine.

However, emphasis is being placed by the official on curbing the Kremlin’s capacity to do harm, rather than escalating conflict. “It’s not that we are looking for some big confrontation with Russia, or that this is about ultimately regime change,” the official said.

In her remarks to EU leaders, May will stress the reckless nature of the attack in Salisbury against Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, who remain seriously ill in hospital, and that the use of the Novichok nerve agent was a clear breach of the chemical weapons convention.

British officials have briefed allies about the precise composition of the nerve agent from the Novichok group for their own experts to assess.

“Disrespect for international rules and norms clearly threatens the basis for our advanced democracy, open society and free economies,” a senior No 10 official said. “The Russian threat does not respect borders and as such we are all at risk.”



00:48 Vladimir Putin: 'Nonsense' to think Russia would poison ex-spy before election - video

Downing Street is not expecting a detailed list of actions member states will sign up to after the prime minister meets EU leaders. “This is a gradual process, it will take some time, it is a long-term challenge,” the No 10 official said. “Tomorrow is part of the process.”

Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have begun working at the scene of the nerve agent attack on the Skripals, although they will be unlikely to report for at least a fortnight.

On Wednesday, the Foreign Office released a social media video attacking Russia’s response to the chemical weapons attack, listing 17 separate explanations proposed by its state media or state spokespeople – including blaming the Skripals’ condition on an attempted suicide or accidental overdoses and pointing the finger at five other countries, including Ukraine and Sweden. Other theories have blamed Yulia Skripal’s future mother-in-law, or called the attack a false flag.

The meeting in Brussels is the latest phase of a diplomacy blitz by May and senior ministers to persuade states to back Britain’s judgment that the Russian state is responsible, prompting statements of support from 35 countries.

A unified response from European leaders may not be forthcoming, with Greece in particular appearing to be resistant to comprehensively assigning blame to the Russian state.

A statement from EU foreign ministers earlier this week did not go as far as a joint US, France and Germany statement last week, which said there were “no plausible alternatives” to Russia’s culpability but instead said the EU “takes extremely seriously” Britain’s claims that Russia was responsible.

Britain previously accused Russia of being behind what it has called the ""brazen"" nerve-agent attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, in Salisbury, England, on March 4. Friday's comments from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson mark the first time that Putin has been blamed directly.

""Our quarrel is with Putin’s Kremlin, and with his decision, and we think it is overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the U.K., on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the second World War,"" Johnson told reporters in the British capital. Moscow strongly denies the allegation and called Johnson's remarks ""shocking"" and ""inexcusable.""

Leaders from the United States, Germany and France joined the U.K. in accusing Russia of being behind the attack in a statement Thursday. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg followed that up Friday by saying that the incident reflected a Russian ""pattern of reckless behavior"" that includes cyberattacks and election meddling.

More:What you didn't know about Russian President Putin

Britain this week ordered the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats and cancelled high-level bilateral contact with the Kremlin. Russia has said it will reply in kind. In a separate action, the Trump administration issued sanctions on a number of Russian entities for a wide range of behavior, including attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Sergei Skripal moved to Salisbury after being jailed for passing Russian state secrets to British intelligence while working for the Russian government in the 1990s. His daughter, who lives in Moscow, was visiting him when the pair fell ill and were later found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury. They remain in a critical condition.

British police said Friday 131 people were exposed to trace amounts of the military-grade nerve agent used in the assault. None have shown any symptoms.

They also launched a murder investigation into the death of Nikolai Glushkov, a Russian businessman who was found dead in his London home on Tuesday.

Glushkov was strangled. While there is no evidence yet to link his killing to the Skripals' case, police said they were ""keeping an open mind"" because of Glushkov's nationality and his association with Boris Berezovsky, a Russian oligarch and Putin critic who died under mysterious circumstances in 2013. Glushkov had previous convictions for money laundering and fraud and is the former deputy director of Russia's state airline, Aeroflot.",anti-russian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/13/spy-poisoning-why-putin-may-have-engineered-gruesome-calling-card,301,24,"The response from the Kremlin has been uncompromising. The foreign ministry described Theresa May’s accusation against Moscow as a “circus show”. Its boss Sergei Lavrov said there was no proof the poison used against Sergei Skripal came from Russia. And the embassy in London promised an “equal and opposite reaction” to any UK measures.

Beneath this bluster, however, is cool calculation. Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in Salisbury with a Moscow-made military nerve agent, developed during the 1970s and 1980s during the cold war. Whoever wanted to murder him might have used a subtler weapon. Instead, his assassins picked novichok. How it was deployed remains unclear.



One former employee of the Russian special services said nerve agents were used only if the goal was to draw attention. “This is a very dirty method. There’s a risk of contaminating other people, which creates additional difficulties,” he told the Kommersant newspaper, adding: “There are far more delicate methods that professionals use.”

In other words, novichok was a gruesome calling card. As those who organised the hit must have known, the trail goes directly back to Moscow. The incident even took place down the road from Porton Down, the government’s military research base, which swiftly tested and identified the toxin.

All of which means Vladimir Putin and his FSB spy agency have probably sought to engineer a confrontation with the UK. Why now?

There are many theories. The most obvious answer is Sunday’s presidential election. True, Putin is guaranteed to win. He has scarcely bothered campaigning. But the Kremlin remains worried about turnout, amid widespread voter apathy and calls from Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition politician, to boycott the vote. The authorities want to the poll to look authentic, even if it isn’t.

Over the next few days, state TV channels will pump out this message: Moscow is again the victim of a western conspiracy. Russia under siege is a favourite Kremlin theme. Conflicts with the west can bear some fruit: Putin has maintained the bump in his nominal popularity rating after his annexation of Crimea, despite western condemnation and sanctions. The wave of patriotism that followed also split the Russian opposition.

So a row with London can do Putin no harm, especially among voters who share his uncompromising nationalist worldview and his smouldering sense of victimhood.

One former senior Foreign Office adviser said it was a mistake to assume that Skripal’s spy work for MI6 triggered the decision to poison him in Salisbury. Skripal was merely the “instrument”. The real target was the UK, he said. “I don’t think it was about Skripal. It was a geo-political intervention.”

The adviser added: “Moscow’s goal is to demonstrate the UK’s weakness and isolation and to drive a wedge between us and other countries. The Kremlin understands how to make these sorts of interventions at just below the level that will trigger a serious collective reaction against them.”

If May fails to react adequately, she would appear weak. If she tries to fight back against Russia, she would discover the limits of collective solidarity, the adviser suggested.

There are other theories. Grigol Chkhartishvili, best known for writing detective novels under the pen name Boris Akunin, suggested Putin was betting on a British retaliation that would drive wealthy and prominent Russians out of London. The community of Russian émigrés (and families of wealthy businessmen and officials) was “one of the weak points of the regime”, he wrote, and forcing them out would be “useful and beneficial” for Putin.

Timeline Poisoned umbrellas and polonium: Russian-linked UK deaths Show September 1978 Georgi Markov In one of the most chilling episodes of the cold war, the Bulgarian dissident was poisoned with a specially adapted umbrella on Waterloo Bridge. As he waited for a bus, Markov felt a sharp prick in his leg. The opposition activist, who was an irritant to the communist government of Bulgaria, died three days later. A deadly pellet containing ricin was found in his skin. His unknown assassin is thought to have been from the secret services in Bulgaria. November 2006 Alexander Litvinenko The fatal poisoning of the former FSB officer sparked an international incident. Litvinenko fell ill after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium. He met his killers in a bar of the Millennium hotel in Mayfair. The pair were Andrei Lugovoi – a former KGB officer turned businessman, who is now a deputy in Russia’s state Duma – and Dmitry Kovtun, a childhood friend of Lugovoi’s from a Soviet military family. Putin denied all involvement and refused to extradite either of the killers. March 2012 German Gorbuntsov The exiled Russian banker survived an attempt on his life as he got out of a cab in east London. He was shot four times with a silenced pistol. He had been involved in a bitter dispute with two former business partners. November 2012 Alexander Perepilichnyy The businessman collapsed while running near his home in Surrey. Traces of a chemical that can be found in the poisonous plant gelsemium were later found in his stomach. Before his death, Perepilichnyy was helping a specialist investment firm uncover a $230m Russian money-laundering operation, a pre-inquest hearing was told. Hermitage Capital Management claimed that Perepilichnyy could have been deliberately killed for helping it uncover the scam involving Russian officials. He may have eaten a popular Russian dish containing the herb sorrel on the day of his death, which could have been poisoned. March 2013 Boris Berezovsky The exiled billionaire was found hanged in an apparent suicide after he had spent more than decade waging a high-profile media battle against his one-time protege Putin. A coroner recorded an open verdict after hearing conflicting expert evidence about the way he died. A pathologist who conducted a postmortem examination on the businessman’s body said he could not rule out murder. December 2014 Scot Young An associate of Berezovsky whom he helped to launder money, he was found impaled on railings after he fell from a fourth-floor flat in central London. A coroner ruled that there was insufficient evidence of suicide. But Young, who was sent to prison in January 2013 for repeatedly refusing to reveal his finances during a divorce row, told his partner he was going to jump out of the window moments before he was found.

4 March 2018 Skripal poisoning Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were were found unconscious on a bench in the Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury after 'suspected exposure to an unknown substance' which was later identified as chemical weapon novichok. In the aftermath Theresa May blamed Vladimir Putin and expelled 23 Russian diplomats who were suspected of spying. Two Russian men using the identities Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov were named as suspects. They appeared on Russian TV to protest their innocence.

The Skripals survived. However a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after spraying novichok on her wrists from a fake Nina Ricci perfume bottle converted into a dispenser, which had been recovered from a skip by her partner Charlie Rowley. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

There has been some outrage from EU capitals. Belgium’s former premier Guy Verhofstadt called for a common European response and said EU leaders should discuss the incident at a summit next week. But given Brexit, Europe’s response is likely to be limited when it comes to practical retaliation.

Until Tuesday evening, Donald Trump had remained silent over the Kremlin’s probable role. He has since told Theresa May in a phone call that his support is conditional on the facts supporting her case. Downing Street said Trump had agreed that “the Russian government must provide unambiguous answers as to how this nerve agent came to be used”.

Until then, only one senior member of his administration had acknowledged that Russia could be responsible: Rex Tillerson. On Tuesday Trump fired Tillerson as secretary of state, underlining that May is likely to receive little or no help from the US, once the UK’s closest ally.

The Skripal attack also appears to have been calculated for its domestic impact. It sends a chilling message to anyone from inside Russia’s spy agencies and bureaucracy thinking of cooperating with western intelligence. The message: that the state can mete out punishment at its own pleasure and in the most barbaric way. Oh, and your family might suffer too.

Moscow’s covert operation to support Trump during the 2016 US election was a large enterprise. It involved career intelligence officers, cyber-criminals and professional trolls. Only Putin and a few top officials know its full scope. But a wider group of individuals understand parts.

The incident, in which Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in Salisbury on March 4, involved “a military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia,” said the statement issued on Thursday. The four countries said the incident constituted “the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War.”

The document branded the incident “an assault on UK sovereignty,” adding it came in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and international law. Washington, Paris and Berlin back the UK’s claim that Moscow was responsible for what they called “the attack.”

Russia should provide “full and complete disclosure” of Novichok – the nerve agent allegedly used to poison the Skripals – to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the statement urged.

Though France was one of the signatories to the statement, a spokesman for President Emmanuel Macron’s suggested earlier on Thursday that British Prime Minister Theresa May was prematurely accusing Russia of complicity in the incident. “We don’t do fantasy politics. Once the elements are proven then the time will come for decisions to be made,” Benjamin Griveaux told a news conference in Paris.

Also on Thursday, Moscow said that it had urged the UK to hand over samples of the chemical to the OPCW and relevant Russian authorities, but to no avail. Commenting on the row, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Britain of refusing to share any evidence in the case, while making “insane” accusations.

London was reluctant to share “any factual information on the [Skripal] case,” she said. The Russian embassy in London has sent four requests to the Foreign Office calling for “extensive dialogue,” but received “formal replies that made no sense.”

Mark Sedwill said in a letter to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Friday that email accounts of Yulia had been targeted in 2013 by cyber specialists from Russia's GRU military intelligence service. Sedwill also said in the letter, which was published by the government, that it was ""highly likely that the Russian intelligence services view at least some of its defectors as legitimate targets for assassination.""

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/uk-finance-power-water-on-high-alert-threat-russian-cyber-reprisal-grows,402,325,"Banks, energy and water companies are on maximum alert over the threat of a serious cyber-attack from Moscow as concern continues over the safety of Russian exiles in the UK.

Fears that Russia will target Britain’s critical national infrastructure have prompted round-the-clock threat assessments by the UK’s financial sector, energy firms and GCHQ, the UK’s largest intelligence agency, along with the security services MI5 and MI6.

The Bank of England, major financiers, including Lloyds, and organisations such as Water UK are working with the government’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to assess the next move from Moscow following the murder of Nikolai Glushkov, 68, and the Salisbury chemical attack.

Scotland Yard on Saturday issued a renewed appeal for information for anyone who may have seen a burgundy red BMW owned by Sergei Skripal, 66, the former Russian spy who was found unconscious on 4 March in Salisbury along with his daughter, Yulia. The pair were poisoned with a nerve agent and remain critical but stable in hospital.

Glushkov, a businessman and a known critic of President Vladimir Putin, was found strangled at his home in London last week. Police across Britain have begun contacting Russian exiles to discuss their safety as they investigate the murder of Glushkov, understood to have been on a list of 22 “fugitives” published by the Russian embassy in London last year. Officers have yet to establish if there is a link between the attacks.

Intelligence officials, however, fear that Moscow may strike next using very different methods, referring to Russia’s involvement in the crippling NotPetya ransomware cyber-attack last year that targeted Ukraine’s financial, energy and government sectors before it spread across the world.

On Thursday the Trump administration accused Russia of engineering a series of cyber-attacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electricity systems, the first time the United States has publicly accused Moscow of hacking into America’s energy infrastructure.

The UK’s NCSC is based inside GCHQ and notifies UK firms considered to be “critical national infrastructure” and the government of the latest threat level. It is monitoring significant Russian activity in the UK, though it is understood that no specific threat from Russia has emerged since the attempted murder of Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter and the murder of Glushkov. Robert Hannigan, a former director of GCHQ and the National Security Council, told the Observer that the NCSC was monitoring “very large volumes” of attacks every day on the UK, including its globally important financial services.

Hannigan, who was responsible for the UK’s first cyber strategy in 2009 and is now a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said that from his experience, which also includes three years as prime minister Tony Blair’s security adviser, he had never seen Russia so unpredictable and hostile. “In their [the Russians] current mood it’s hard to know what they will do. What’s different now is the willingness to be reckless, not to play by the rules that most civilised countries play by and not to worry about being found out. They no longer seem to care.”

Hannigan said they were continually detecting Russians on UK cyber networks. “They’re constantly being found on networks but it’s their intent that matters more than the fact they are there. The difficulty with cyber is that you can be on a network to gather intelligence or you can be on a network to do something destructive and the two look pretty much the same.”

A senior banking source, confirming that the sector was working closely with GCHQ and the security services to evaluate any threat from Russia, said they were also concerned about the risk of attack, not just from the Kremlin but from rogue elements caught up in the febrile climate that has prevailed since the Salisbury chemical attack. “It is possible that Russian patriots may take it upon themselves to make a point at a time like this,” said the source.

A Lloyds spokesman said: “We update and test our defences regularly and work closely with both industry bodies and law enforcement agencies to help us protect our customers.” A Water UK spokesperson, which represents the major water companies, said it was in regular contact with government officials to ensure its cyber defences were sufficiently robust. The UK government has floated the idea of fining organisations which fail to implement effective cyber security measures as part of plans to make Britain’s essential infrastructure resilient against future cyber-attacks. Beyza Unal, a research fellow at Chatham House’s international security department, said that the UK had been shoring up its defences in the face of the evolving cyber threat. “The UK has a really good cyber defence strategy planning as well as organisation, each sector talks to the government organisations,” she said.

Latest figures from the NCSC reveal more than 1,100 attacks over the past year, 590 significant. Thirty required action by government bodies, a number of which targeted the UK’s internationally important financial sector.",anti-russian,0

""It is good that the British government will now provide samples [of the substance that was used to poison Skripal] to international organizations,"" Merkel said, adding that she was going to discuss the ""appropriate reaction that will follow"" with Macron.

The same position has been voiced by the French president, who has also blamed Moscow for the attack.

""Everything indicates that it was Russia who committed this murder attempt,"" he said.

Earlier in the day, Russian Envoy to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Alexander Shulgin said that Moscow was interested in determining the truth in the Skripal case more than London.

Meanwhile, Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz has said that Poland is ready to join new sanctions against Russia that could be imposed over the Skripal's poisoning.

""Speaking about the sanctions, Poland could support such activities… I have expressed my readiness to touch on this issue on Monday during the session of the EU foreign ministers, this topic has been put on the agenda [of the meeting],"" Czaputowicz said.

The politician added that the international community should show decisiveness in this issue.

The stetement of the Polish senior official comes a day after French President Emmanuel Macron said he would announce the measures against Moscow ""in the coming days,"" and condemned the attack, in which ""everything points to the fact that Russia is responsible.""

Emmanuel Macron has said he will unveil measures against Russia in response to the poisoning of the former spy Sergei Skripal on British soil in the coming days.

The French president spoke with Theresa May on the phone on Thursday morning about “progress of the investigation” in the nerve agent attack, which the British Government says was carried out by Russia.

The apparent about-face comes after a muted response from France, with one spokesperson having said yesterday the country would wait until the “elements are proven” instead of relying on “fantasy politics”.

But in a statement issued on Thursday morning, a spokesperson for Mr Macron said: “Since the beginning of the week, the United Kingdom has kept France closely informed of the evidence gathered by British investigators and evidence of Russia’s responsibility in the attack.

“France agrees with the United Kingdom that there is no other plausible explanation and reiterates its solidarity with its ally.”

Speaking separately to reporters in western France, Mr Macron himself added, according to the Reuters news agency: “Everything leads us to believe that responsibility is in fact attributable to Russia,” Macron told reporters in western France.

“I will announce in the coming days the measures that we intend to take.”

A Downing Street spokesperson said: “President Macron said that France completely shares the UK’s assessment that there is no plausible explanation other than that Russia was responsible for the attack and he once again expressed his full support for the UK as a close and strong ally.

https://www.rt.com/news/421316-russia-uk-may-unsc/,604,469,"The West has launched a large-scale campaign to remove Russia from the UN Security Council (UNSC), Senator Sergey Kalashnikov said, commenting on the UK's accusations against Moscow over the poisoning of Sergei Skripal.

“The West has launched a massive operation in order to kick Russia out of the UN Security Council,” Kalashnikov said, as cited by RIA Novosti. “Russia is now a very inconvenient player for the Western nations and this explains all the recent attacks on our country.”

The Senator believes that in order to curb Russia’s membership there is going to be an attempt to reform the principal UN body tasked with the maintenance of international peace and security. The Russian Federal Council member reminded that the USSR, to which Russia is the legal successor, has been an integral part of the UNSC since its establishment in 1946.

On Wednesday, Labor MP Chris Leslie addressed May on the issue of reforming the UN Security Council in order to limit Russia’s rights within the body during a parliament session.

Leslie argued that Russia was “increasingly looking like a rogue state,” adding that “we must now begin to talk about reform” of the UNSC. “Russia can’t be allowed to simply sit pretty, thumbing its nose to the rest of the world community and feeling that it’s immune from the rule of law internationally,” Leslie said.

May responded by saying that Leslie was not the only one to stress the need for changes within the UNSC, promising that “this is something that we will look at.”

“We do talk to the United Nations about the reform of the UN in a whole variety of ways. Of course, any decision – the Catch 22 if you like – is that any decision that might be taken in the Security Council to reform it, of course, could be subject to a veto by Russia, who are sitting there,” the prime minister said.

Earlier in the day, the British government said that it was seeking an urgent UN Security Council meeting to update members on the Skripal case. The Russian-UK double agent and his daughter remain in critical condition after being discovered slumped on a bench in Salisbury in early March.

The UK authorities claim that that the duo were poisoned with a Soviet-engineered nerve agent called Novichok. On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May alleged that the attack was either authorized by the Russian government or Moscow allowed the nerve agent to fall into the wrong hands.

Russia has said that it’s open to cooperation with the UK on the Skripal case if it’s carried out in accordance with international law and Moscow is treated as an equal partner in the probe. Russia has also officially requested that the UK provide all the case files regarding the incident, but the request was turned down.

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/24/sergei-skripal-kremlin-denies-friend-claim-asked-putin-for-pardon,611,28,"The Kremlin has denied a claim that the poisoned former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal wrote to Vladimir Putin asking to be pardoned and to be allowed to visit his home country.



The former Russian intelligence officer, who came to Britain in 2010 as part of a spy swap, regretted being a double agent and wanted to visit his family, his friend Vladimir Timoshkov told the BBC.

Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, remain in a critical condition after they were poisoned with the highly lethal nerve agent novichok in Salisbury on 4 March.

Moscow has stepped up its campaign to discredit Theresa May’s assertion that it is “highly likely” Russia was responsible for the attack.

The diplomatic crisis has plunged Russia and the UK into a diplomatic crisis and could trigger further action by European Union members in support of May’s stance.

But the Russian embassy in London kept up its attempts to challenge the UK’s case – reiterating its suggestion that the Porton Down defence laboratory was developing its own “military-grade poisons”.

The lab, located less than 10 miles from Salisbury, is where tests were carried out to identify the novichok substance.

The Porton Down chief executive, Gary Aitkenhead, told the BBC: “We have got the highest levels of controls, of security, around the work that we do here. We would not be allowed to operate if we had lack of control that could result in anything leaving the four walls of our facility here.”

A Russian embassy spokesman said Aitkenhead’s comment “amounts to admitting that the secret facility is a place where new components of military-grade poisons are being researched and developed”.

On Friday, EU leaders promised an “unprecedented” diplomatic response to the attack after backing May’s assertion that Moscow was responsible.

The bloc is recalling its ambassador to Russia for “consultations” on the Salisbury attack.

Russia has vehemently denied any responsibility for the incident, while Vladimir Chizhov, Russia’s EU ambassador, said that “from the legal point of view the Russian state had nothing against him [Skripal]”.

The 66-year-old Skripal was accused of working for MI6 over several years, in particular disclosing the names of several dozen Russian agents working in Europe.



He was sentenced to 13 years in a high-security prison in August 2006, before being freed in the 2010 deal that saw 10 Russian sleeper agents expelled from the United States.

According to Timoshkov, whom Skripal had known since school, he did not see himself as a traitor as he had sworn an oath to the Soviet Union.

“Many people shunned him. His classmates felt he had betrayed the motherland,” he said.

“In 2012 he called me. We spoke for about half an hour. He called me from London. He denied he was a traitor ... [he told me] he wrote to Vladimir Putin asking to be fully pardoned and to be allowed to visit Russia. His mother, brother and other relatives were [in Russia].”

Russia’s ambassador to the UK sent well wishes to Skripal and his daughter on Friday, saying he hoped for their recovery.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/opcw-russias-alleged-novichok-programme-181813251.html,638,493,"The Hague (AFP) - Leaders of Britain, France, Germany and the US on Thursday published a joint statement condemning the poisoning of Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter earlier this month.

The four Western powers are demanding that Russia make a ""full and complete"" disclosure of its Novichok programme at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague.

Herewith five questions about the OPCW and Russia's Novichok programme:

- What can the OPCW do? -

The most important aspect is for Britain to provide evidence that a chemical weapon has been used by providing samples to be tested, says Alastair Hay, retired professor of environmental toxicology at Leeds University.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the BBC that Britain is sending a sample of the nerve agent to the watchdog for examination.

London may now even ask the world's chemical watchdog to actively probe Russia, its right under the OPCW's Chemical Warfare Convention's challenge procedures.

Under the CWC, states also retain the right to act bilaterally, which is now the case with Britain expelling 23 diplomats and suspending high-level contacts with Moscow.

- Why wasn't Novichok probed? -

Based in The Hague, the OPCW can only investigate chemical weapons that are declared by the organisation's 192 member states.

The OPCW marked the final destruction of Russia's declared chemical weapons stockpile in October last year.

Russia did not declare Novichoks and has denied that they even exist, says chemical weapons expert Mark Bishop at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.

Dissident Soviet scientist Vil Mirzanayov, exiled in the United States, gained notoriety in the 1990s for his claims that Moscow was secretly developing Novichok and maintained tens of tonnes of the binary nerve agent in its undeclared chemical stockpile.

- How effective is the OPCW then? -

The OPCW ""has been very effective in creating a world free of chemical weapons"" says Sico van der Meer, researcher at The Hague's Clingendael Institute.

Story continues

More than 95 percent of the world's declared chemical stockpiles have now been destroyed and the OPCW in 2013 won the Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to rid the world of chemical arms.

The organisations' inspectors have been highly effective, but the system is not completely watertight, the experts say.

""If somebody wants to do harm, then there is always a way to do harm,"" said Van der Meer.

- What does the CWC say? -

It is the responsibility of the signatory to the Chemical Warfare Convention to declare its chemical weapons, including what they are, the quantities and the location and storage and production facilities.

The OPCW has the right to inspect facilities, but cannot do a house-to-house search.

Thus a certain level of trust is involved.

- Has Russia contravened the CWC? -

The CWC requires that member countries declare all of their chemical weapons. Russia on Thursday repeated its consistent denial that Novichok ever existed.

Britain's ambassador to the OPCW, Peter Wilson, on Tuesday accused Moscow of failing ""for many years"" to fully declare its chemical weapons stockpile. Chemical weapons expert Bishop said Moscow has claimed that its understanding of the pact was that it had to declare only chemicals that were destined for use in chemical weapons and not research chemicals.

""There are many toxic chemicals that chemists have produced that could be used as weapons, but have actually been produced for other purposes,"" he said.

""The Russians can say that they were doing research on Novichok-like chemicals to be used in pesticides"" for instance, Bishop said.",anti-russian,0
https://qz.com/1238475/critics-are-pressing-britain-to-rethink-the-golden-visas-rule/,667,513,"The Kremlin’s alleged poisoning of British agent Sergei Skripal on UK soil has made Westminster rethink a lot of things. It’s reinvestigating the unexplained deaths of 14 people allegedly connected to Russia. It has expelled 23 Russian diplomats, whom it says were cloaked spies. And MPs are calling for Russian oligarchs to reveal just where they got their millions to buy London real estate.

Now, the government is reviewing its controversial program of giving 5-year visas to people who invest £2 million in British government bonds and other programs, prime minister Theresa May said in the House of Commons yesterday (March 26). Anti-corruption activists have long railed against the so-called “golden” visa, which is beloved of Russian and Chinese elites. The two countries made up more than 50% of the recipients of investor visas for every year from 2011 to 2016, according to Transparency International.

Why is that a problem?

Firstly, the cash wasn’t subject to any anti-money laundering checks until 2015. The government previously allowed people to apply for visas without a UK bank account—they assumed that once an account was open, the banks would do the requisite checks. However, the banks presumed that having a government-stamped visa means they’d been cleared for money laundering, and so no due diligence was done on either side, TI writes.

Secondly, holding property in the UK is an excellent way for government-linked foreign elites to raise money and do nefarious things. The US government discovered that when it realized that Iran had secretly been using rent on a Manhattan skyscraper as a slush fund for decades. That kind of income could potentially enable people linked to the Russian state to pay hitmen based in the UK to kill people without any cash coming in from outside the British financial system. And that doesn’t sound so “golden” at all.",anti-russian,0
https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-britain-war-on-words/4316176.html,718,549,"Britain and Russia have been waging a fast and furious information war since former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were found poisoned March 4 in the provincial English town of Salisbury.

Not a day has gone by without at least one fierce exchange between British and Russian officials — and both governments have turned to social media, from Twitter to Facebook, to make accusations and counter-claims in their efforts to convince a global audience of guilt or innocence.

And the barbs flying have been getting more personal. The British narrative has been more consistent, demanding an explanation from Moscow for why a Soviet-developed nerve agent, Novichok, was used to poison the Skripals and arguing the only plausible one is that the attempted assassination was sanctioned by the Russian government, a view endorsed by European Union leaders last week and by the U.S. government.

Russian officials have offered more than 20 different explanations about who might have been behind the nerve-agent poisoning of the Skripals or why Russia is innocent of the charge of being behind the assassination attempt. Western officials charge this changing of stories is designed to muddy the waters and sow doubt.

Russian explanations have ranged from claims the British might have done it themselves to accusations that the whole incident was made up. Kremlin officials have insinuated also that Sweden, Slovakia or the Czech Republic may be to blame, earning sharp rebukes from the governments of all three European countries. The Russian finger has pointed at Uzbekistan and Ukraine, too.

“The authorities of UK are not interested in finding the truth about the Skripal case, they have other motives,” lamented the Russian Mission to the United Nations on Twitter last week. “They are using propaganda war tools to influence an uninformed and impressionable public. There are no facts, only allegations about the 'Russian trace,’” the mission added.

On Saturday, the Russian emphasis returned once again to implying that Britain itself was behind the assassination bid, with officials noting that Porton Down, the British military research facility, is only about 10 miles from where the Skripals were discovered. The shifting Russian narratives give Moscow some advantages in the information war, say analysts.

“Russia feels free to say whatever it wants, it doesn’t feel need to tell truth, be consistent, or stick to any norms or rules,” says a communications strategist, who has worked for the British government. “These are handicaps in a battle like this,” he adds. Britain doesn’t have the same centralized, aggressive messaging machinery the Kremlin has, he notes.

Social media battle

Moscow has also launched an extensive social media-based disinformation campaign to buttress it claims of innocence as well as to press its accusations that London is in the grip of Russophobia, say Western analysts.

“Twitter has become a battleground,” says Ben Nimmo, an analyst with the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, a New York-based think tank. Supporters and defenders of the Russian government have clashed over who was to blame, and which side to believe; politicians and diplomats have joined in on both sides with much of the invective ‘organic” and driven by angry users and officials, he says.

But Russia’s so-called troll factories have also been at work using fake and automated social media accounts able to spread rapidly memes and messages.

Atlantic Council researchers have been plotting the activity of accounts that have been used in other Kremlin disinformation campaigns — notably during the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine. One tactic they have spotted is the large-scale amplification by Russia’s troll accounts of doubts or criticism posted by genuine British critics of the British government or conspiracy theorists in a bid to show that Britons did not believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin was behind the poisoning.

British officials estimate at least 2,800 robotic troll accounts have posted messages or re-tweets about the attempted assassination of the Skripals reaching at least 7.5 million people in Britain. Facebook also has witnessed a large volume of postings of English-language content produced by Russian state-owned media.

Russia’s Twitter campaign “shows the power which anonymous trolls with demonstrably falsified profiles continue to wield online,” says Nimmo.

British officials have sought to expose the methodology behind what they say is Russia’s online disinformation campaign, posting on social media sites last week a video mocking the shifting narratives their Russian rivals have offered for what happened to the Skripals.

Not that Britain’s information approach is receiving unblemished praise. On Saturday, a former British envoy to Moscow, Tony Brenton, said while he supported the actions taken by the British government over the Skripal poisoning, he worried the language use, especially by Britain foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has compared Putin to Adolf Hitler, was “unnecessarily virulent.”

He told a British newspaper: “Obviously we have to react robustly and firmly to deal with the Skripal outrage, but at some point we are going to have to get back to doing business with Russia. We should certainly be taking action that minimizes the recurrence of [a similar] attack, but we should not be burning our bridges so much that we cannot re-establish lines of communication.”

There is also criticism of Johnson in the Russian capital from British expatriates who say his comparisons of Russia now with Nazi Germany of the 1930s and 1940s is deeply offensive, noting that the Great Patriotic War, as Russians describe the Second World War, is something people from across the spectrum here celebrate.",anti-russian,0
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-u-s-election-interference-i-couldn-t-care-less-n855151,729,557,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has told NBC News that he ""couldn't care less"" if Russian citizens tried to interfere in the 2016 American presidential election because, he claims, they were not connected to the Kremlin.

In an exclusive and at-times combative interview with NBC's Megyn Kelly, Putin again denied the charge by U.S. intelligence services that he ordered meddling in the November 2016 vote that put Donald Trump in the White House.

""Why have you decided the Russian authorities, myself included, gave anybody permission to do this?"" asked Putin, who will probably be returned as president in the March 18 elections.

Putin was unmoved by an indictment filed by special counsel Robert Mueller last month that accused 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies of interfering in the election — including supporting Trump's campaign and ""disparaging"" Hillary Clinton's.

Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin.

""So what if they're Russians?"" Putin said of the people named in last month's indictment. ""There are 146 million Russians. So what? ... I don't care. I couldn't care less. ... They do not represent the interests of the Russian state.""

Putin even suggested that Jews or other ethnic groups had been involved in the meddling.

""Maybe they're not even Russians,"" he said. ""Maybe they're Ukrainians, Tatars, Jews, just with Russian citizenship. Even that needs to be checked. Maybe they have dual citizenship. Or maybe a green card. Maybe it was the Americans who paid them for this work. How do you know? I don't know.""

Asked whether he was concerned about Russian citizens attacking U.S. democracy, Putin replied that he had yet to see any evidence that the alleged interference had broken Russian law.

""Are we the ones who imposed sanctions on the United States? The U.S. imposed sanctions on us.""

""We in Russia cannot prosecute anyone as long as they have not violated Russian law,"" he said. ""At least send us a piece of paper. ... Give us a document. Give us an official request. And we'll take a look at it.""

U.S. intelligence agencies and many Western analysts have said that Russian interference came at the orders of the Kremlin. Putin, Russia's longest-serving leader since Stalin, dismissed this.

""Could anyone really believe that Russia, thousands of miles away ... influenced the outcome of the election? Doesn't that sound ridiculous even to you?"" he said. ""It's not our goal to interfere. We do not see what goal we would accomplish by interfering. There's no goal.""

Experts like John Brennan, a former CIA director and now an NBC News analyst, say Moscow's goal was clear.

""To weaken the United States government,"" Brennan said in a separate interview, summarizing his opinion of the Kremlin's aims. This, he added, was so ""the U.S. government is not going to be able to deal with international issues and confronting Russian aggression as assertively as it needs to.""

Trump has called Putin ""a strong leader"" who has ""done a very brilliant job in terms of what he represents and who he's representing.""

Trump has also hinted that he gives Putin the benefit of the doubt when he denies that Moscow interfered.

""[Putin] said he absolutely did not meddle in our election. He did not do what they are saying he did,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Hanoi following a meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Danang in November.

In the interview with Kelly, Putin called the U.S. president ""a businessman with vast experience"" and ""a quick study"" despite being new to politics.

""He understands that if it is necessary to establish a cooperative relationship with someone, then you have to treat your current or potential partner with respect,"" Putin said. ""Engaging in mutual accusations and insults, this is a road to nowhere.""

Putin said he doesn't read Trump's tweets and doesn't tweet himself.

Asked why not, he said: ""I have other ways of expressing my point of view or implementing a decision. Donald is a more modern individual.""

Putin is facing little opposition in the presidential election whose first round is on March 18.

""Well, we will see. It's up to the Russian voters,"" he said.

In terms of the future of Russia-U.S. relations, he cast Russia as the victim.

""We are not the ones who labeled you our enemies. You made a decision, at the level of parliament, at the level of Congress and put Russia on your list of enemies,"" he said. ""Why did you do that? Are we the ones who imposed sanctions on the United States? The U.S. imposed sanctions on us.""

Putin claimed he would be willing to repair relations with Washington.

""Listen, let's sit down calmly, talk and figure things out,"" he said. ""I believe that the current president wants to do that, but there are forces that won't let him do it.""",anti-russian,0

Tensions between the two nations have now reached Cold War-era levels of frostiness.

The diplomatic snit stems from the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, who were found unconscious on a park bench in a shopping area in Salisbury, England, on March 4. They remain in a critical condition.

A Russian lawmaker blamed Britain Saturday for the escalating tensions. Konstantin Kosachev, the had of the foreign affairs committe in the upper house of the Russian parliament told The Associated Press, “This is not our choice, definitely. We have not raised any tensions in our relations, it was the decision by the British side without evidence.”

Britain's foreign minister Boris Johnson said Friday it was ""overwhelmingly likely"" President Vladimir Putin directly ordered the attack. British officials say military-grade nerve agent was used.

""Our quarrel is with Putin’s Kremlin, and with his decision, and we think it is overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the U.K., on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the second World War,"" Johnson told reporters in the British capital.

Britain has cancelled high-level bilateral contact with the Kremlin and May on Wednesday gave 23 Russian diplomats a week to leave Britain.

Moscow strongly denied any involvement in the poisoning and called Johnson's remarks ""shocking"" and ""inexcusable.""

Russia's foreign ministry said the diplomats in Moscow have one week to leave. It also ordered the closure of the British Council, a public information and educational center, in Russia, and halted the reopening of a British consulate in St. Petersburg.

Top diplomats from the European Union are expected to discuss next steps in the Skipals' case on Monday, with some calling for a boycott of the upcoming World Cup in Russia. May seeks a global coalition of countries to punish Moscow.

Leaders from the United States, Germany and France have already joined the U.K. in accusing Russia of being behind the attack in a statement this week. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg followed that up Friday by saying that the incident reflected a Russian ""pattern of reckless behavior"" that includes cyberattacks and election meddling.

In a separate action, the Trump administration issued sanctions on a number of Russian entities for a wide range of behavior, including attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

Russia will hold a presidential election of its own on Sunday, which Putin is widely expected to win. He has already been in power 18 years and could stay until 2024.

Sergei Skripal moved to Salisbury after being jailed for passing Russian state secrets to British intelligence while working for the Russian government in the 1990s. His daughter, who lives in Moscow, was visiting him when the pair fell ill.

British police said Friday 131 people were exposed to trace amounts of the military-grade nerve agent, Novichok, used in the assault. None have shown any symptoms.

Britain says the nerve agent could only have come from a government source. Russia has asked to be allowed to examine the evidence and claims that so far it has not been allowed to do so.

Police have also launched a murder investigation into the death of Nikolai Glushkov, a Russian businessman who was found dead in his London home on Tuesday. Glushkov was strangled.

While there is no evidence yet to link his killing to the Skripals' case, police said they were ""keeping an open mind"" because of Glushkov's nationality and his association with Boris Berezovsky, a Russian oligarch and Putin critic who died under disputed circumstances in 2013. Glushkov had convictions for money laundering and fraud and is the former deputy director of Russia's state airline, Aeroflot.",anti-russian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/17/sergei-skripal-yulia-expelling-russian-diplomats-vladimir-putin-theresa-may,791,590,"Is Vladimir Putin engaged in a long-running, murderous and ongoing campaign to silence Russian defectors, emigres and dissidents living in the UK? That is perhaps the most pressing of many questions facing the government after Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in Salisbury.

Russia’s retaliatory expulsion of 23 diplomats, announced on Saturday, was as unjustified as it was expected. Its vindictive and unwarranted decision to go further and shut down the British Council highlighted the Putin regime’s fear of open societies and disregard for its citizens’ best interests.

It has been suggested that the attempt to murder the Skripals was timed to whip up nationalistic fervour and boost Putin’s presidential re-election bid. Another theory is that the use of an illegal, highly toxic nerve agent, whose detection was certain, was intended to humiliate Britain and send a message about the risks of confronting a Russia supposedly restored to great power status.

It is also argued that Russia has been prematurely blamed and that the intelligence services may be surreptitiously pushing Britain into a new cold war, just as they ostensibly pushed us into Iraq.

All these hypotheses fall wide of the mark. Putin’s re-election is not in doubt; he effectively fixed the result in advance. The west is well aware of Moscow’s revived ambitions; it needs no reminding. And in terms of might, reach and influence, Putin’s Russia is a sickly shadow of the former Soviet Union. He is the capo of a corrupt rogue regime, not the leader of a once proud superpower.

And Putin has form. What now seems most likely is that the Salisbury atrocity was part of a wider campaign against Russian nationals in Britain who Putin personally regards as traitors or enemies. One aim is to silence them, by whatever means. Another aim is to send an intimidatory message to Russians in Russia that challenging the regime is a potentially life-threatening activity.

The suspected murder in London last week of Nikolai Glushkov, a long-time Putin critic, must now be added to a list of 14 suspicious deaths of Russians in Britain, first compiled in a BuzzFeed investigation last year. Belatedly, the government has acceded to calls from Labour’s Yvette Cooper, among others, to investigate possible involvement of the Russian state or state-sponsored assassins.

The exceptional significance of the Skripal attack cannot be overstated. It involved the use of a chemical weapon on European soil for the first time since 1945. It potentially endangered thousands of British citizens. It showed blatant disregard for international law and the UN charter. And because the only really plausible, credible explanation is that it was ordered or approved by Putin and his cronies, it represents a direct challenge by the Russian state not only to Britain but to all law-abiding countries.

Yet the growing suspicion that the Skripal affair is but one incident in a continuing succession of lethal outrages dating back to the 2006 murder by Russian agents of Alexander Litvinenko raises the problem to an even higher level of seriousness. An obvious, urgent question is: who’s next? It is right that counter-terrorism officers are now reportedly talking to Russian exiles about their safety.

Theresa May’s government bears an enormous responsibility. The expulsion of Russian diplomats was the easy bit. May and her ministers must ensure that no further killings take place on British soil; that everything is done to demonstrate, incontrovertibly, whether Russia attacked the Skripals, and that the correct technical procedures are followed through the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the UN; that effective measures are finally taken to stop the flow of dirty Russian money through London; and that key allies, notably France and the US, which initially questioned Britain’s case, do not go wobbly again.

Britain cannot manage this crisis alone. It needs the help of its friends and allies if it is to force Putin to back off.",anti-russian,0

The official statement Prime Minister Theresa May offered in the House of Commons today, saying it was “highly likely” Russia was the perpetrator, would be immediately supported by a carefully coordinated statement by the U.S. government, as well as other important allies in an effort led by the United States. The U.S. would lead the way to forge some kind of common nato statement, as well as—given the difficulties of Brexit—working to ensure that the European Union demonstrated solidarity, too… As the default continues and expands, the evidence accumulates: Trump simply will not act to protect the U.S. and its allies against even Russian aggression, even on their own territory, even in the form of attempted murder.

Russian media sounds pretty excited about Sanders’s caution too:

Anti-Trumpers are on edge about this because they remember the umpteen times Trump has been asked about Russian interference in the 2016 election, which his intel chiefs agree on, and has hedged with some variation of “it could have been them but it could have been others too.” If he pulls that again this time, it’ll pit him directly against May and the UK, who are obviously sufficiently confident in their conclusion despite the slight hedge in the term “highly likely” to have leveled this accusation at Russia on the world stage today. Trump maintaining neutrality between the Brits and human garbage like Putin’s regime would be a killshot to the “special relationship” potentially.

But wait. Watch the clip.

NEW: Press Sec. Sanders calls nerve agent attack in UK an ""outrage,"" says ""we stand by our closest ally."" Prime Minister May said today it is ""highly likely"" Russia was behind the attack. https://t.co/us4YZt6Mgo pic.twitter.com/VefNcV5tYN — ABC News (@ABC) March 12, 2018

Sanders says most of the right things. The attack is an “outrage” and, more importantly, “we stand by our closest ally and the special relationship that we have.” It doesn’t sound like she’s setting up for a momentous break with the UK; she makes clear that we’re taking a side in a dispute involving Russia and it’s the right side. Maybe U.S. intelligence is still reviewing the evidence and, as a matter of basic good practice, can’t say it agrees with May’s conclusion about culpability until that review is complete. Remember, it’s not true that Trump has studiously avoided doing anything that might anger Putin. He may even enjoy the opportunity in this case to prove to the collusion true believers that he’s willing to side with a traditional ally against Russia.

The alternative, that Sanders is under strict orders from the boss not to blame Putin no matter what American analysts say, will become clear enough in the next few days when he’s asked about this. (I can hear it now: “The UK kills lots of people too, you know.”) If U.S. intelligence confirms the findings of British intel and Trump hedges on accusing Putin again, that’ll demonstrate fairly conclusively that something preventing him from criticizing the Kremlin is hanging over Trump’s head. It’s one thing for him not to condemn Russia’s campaign interference because he thinks admitting that it happened will taint his glorious victory. There’s no similar explanation for rejecting the conclusions of UK intel, though. If he does that, it’ll suggest that he’s either under Putin’s thumb or that he wants a tectonic reorientation of U.S. foreign policy away from Europe and towards Russia.

But as I say, if he wanted that, what’s Sanders doing in front of the cameras reminding everyone of the “special relationship”? And what’s his top diplomat doing accusing Russia of being behind the attack?

He's been living in Britain ever since.

After an investigation, British officials accused the Kremlin of organizing the March 4 attack, which is thought to have exposed as many as 130 people to the nerve agent. At least 50 were treated in a hospital. In a statement to the House of Commons on March 12, Prime Minister Theresa May said it was “highly likely” that Russian officials organized the poisoning.

In response, Britain has called for international consequences.

On Monday, the world got a better sense of what those consequences might look like. In a coordinated announcement, several European countries booted Russian diplomats from their soil. Around the same time, President Trump announced that he would do the same. He expelled 60 Russian diplomats from the United States and said he plans to shutter Russia's consulate in Seattle.

In 1992, two Russian scientists approached The Post’s Will Englund, then the Moscow correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, with news of a secret nerve agent. (Video: Joyce Lee, Will Englund/The Washington Post)

“Today’s extraordinary international response by our allies stands in history as the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers ever & will help defend our shared security,” British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter. “Russia cannot break international rules with impunity.”

The Kremlin, however, has maintained its innocence, saying at one point that Britain's accusations “border on banditry.” Russia's ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, told reporters that “the Russian state had nothing against” Skripal. Russian leaders have also pointed fingers elsewhere, suggesting that the United States or Britain is trying to frame the Kremlin in a bid to inflame Russiaphobia.

Experts say Russian Twitter trolls are working overtime to amplify this message, alleging that potentially fake accounts linked to a bot factory in St. Petersburg have been sharing social media posts that cast doubt on the British investigation. In one instance, according to experts, trolls circulated a poll that asked whether May had provided the public with enough information.

Ben Nimmo, a senior research fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that after the attack, he saw an “attempt by pro-Russian users to influence the online poll, and thus to create the appearance of greater hostility towards the U.K. government than U.K. users themselves showed.”

By some measures, the campaign is working, at least in Russia. In a phone survey conducted by state-run pollster Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 82 percent of those surveyed had heard about the poisoning of the Skripals. Of that group, just 5 percent said they believed that Britain's allegations against the Kremlin were credible.

About 81 percent agreed that Britain is “ready to use any chance to deepen the crisis in relations with Russia.” Additionally, 59 percent said they would support Moscow's participation in an international investigation of the poisoning.

In response to the latest diplomatic dust-up, the Russian Embassy in Washington tweeted a cheeky poll Monday asking which U.S. consulate Russia should shutter.

http://time.com/5199472/skripal-russia-uk-strength-poison/,835,48,"There can be little doubt that the Russian government is behind the attempted assassination of double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. While there were the typical official denials, the Russian state has ways of communicating its innocence to foreign governments. In this case, it has not done so.

The use of a nerve agent fits a pattern established by the murder of Alexander Litvinenko with polonium in 2006. This was not a McMafia-style operation commissioned by “rogue elements.” If they were to blame, Moscow would be even more alarmed than London. Since the chaos of the 1990s, Putin has restored the state’s traditional prerogatives in foreign covert operations, as well as the president’s prerogatives within it. This was graphically demonstrated in Crimea in early 2014 with the deployment of “little green men.”

But what could be the motive? The Russians think strategically and will have planned this operation carefully in terms of both its execution and impact. What it says to Russians living in the U.K. or those thinking of leaving the country is: disloyalty is always punishable, you will never be free of us and you will never be safe, wherever you live. Singling out the reclusive 66-year old Skripal, eight years after he came to the U.K. and had run out of secrets to tell, simply underlines the point: you do not have to be an arch enemy of the Putin system to be in potential danger, and your family may also be a target.

What it says to the British government led by Theresa May is: we believe you are weak, and we have no respect for you. In recent years, successive British governments have repeatedly communicated weakness to Russia without any intention of doing so.

First, even before the suspicious “suicide” of dissident oligarch Boris Berezovsky in 2013, the U.K. authorities had been singularly lackluster in prosecuting a macabre string of suspect deaths of Russian exiles on British soil. Until 2014, the government resisted a public inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko, signaling that it was disinclined to name and shame Russia for fear of harming attempts to rebuild ties.

Second, Russia viewed the Strategic Defense and Security Review (SDSR) of 2010 as an abdication of Britain’s great power role. The winding down of a fair portion of the U.K.’s maritime reconnaissance and warfare capability in northern waters was regarded with incredulity. The SDSR’s 2015 successor has repaired much of the damage to U.K. defense capacities, but this scarcely has registered in Moscow.

Third, David Cameron’s government chose to absent itself from the Russia–Ukraine “Minsk process,” leaving the running to Paris and Berlin. Given the U.K.’s prominent role in securing the rights and assurances that underpinned Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity (including its signature on the 1994 Budapest Memorandum), London effectively communicated to Moscow that Ukraine had become a lesser priority and that Britain had better things to do. Although the U.K.’s vigorous defence advisory effort has earned plaudits in Kiev, Russia no longer considers Britain to be a serious player in Ukraine.

Fourth, there is Brexit, which many of its supporters believe will strengthen Britain’s global influence. Whatever the merits of that claim, the Russians view Brexit as a case of the U.K. cutting off its nose to spite its face. From the earliest days of the Cold War, the USSR and its Russian successor viewed Britain as Washington’s number one proxy in Europe. From Moscow’s perspective, the U.K.’s position at the EU top table enhanced U.S. and British influence simultaneously. That advantage has been thrown away.

For these reasons, the Skripal affair is not only a reflection of perceived weakness. It is also a test. If the U.K chooses to act toughly, will its allies support it or simply send their best wishes? This latest example of Russian “reconnaissance by combat” puts Britain into a bind.

Fortunately, whatever the allied response, the U.K. is the repository of a national asset of very high value to Russia: the City of London. For many years, it has effectively allowed key Russian stakeholders to use the services of the City – in particular, the London Stock Exchange, as well as the high-end property market – for purposes legitimate, illegitimate and even illegal.

It is time to transform them from a source of advantage to Russia to a strategic asset for the U.K. Doing so will require proper analysis, coordination (including the security services, the Treasury and the Serious Fraud Office) and dedicated resources. Asset freezes, money laundering investigations and selective cancellation of visas for individuals and their families who are either part of the regime or support it will cause real pain in Moscow. Impulsive and symbolic measures will not do the same.

Leon Trotsky once said, “You might not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.” Today’s Russian leadership, political and military, believes it is at war with the West. It is not a war dominated by artillery and tanks, but by finance and social media, with huge opportunities for covert action from disinformation to assassination. As Russia’s Ministry of Defense stated in 2011, to prevail in these new conditions requires “destabilizing the society and state, and forcing the state to make decisions in the interests of the opposing party.” That is the test the U.K. faces.

Last week, in the middle of the U.K.-Russia diplomatic row, Russia issued $4 billion in Eurobonds, half of which were purchased in the United Kingdom.

The failure to sanction the issuance of new Russian sovereign debt has been a key weakness in existing EU and U.S. sanctions for at least two reasons.

First, existing sanctions target Kremlin-linked banks and energy companies to pressure the Russian government but not the state itself, whose sovereign debt can be bought by EU and U.S. entities. While Russia has relatively low public debt levels ($122 billion in domestic debt and $38 billion in Eurobonds as of the end of the third quarter of 2017), it still needs to issue hard currency debt to service its external debt obligations.

Second, while the sanctions regimes prevent targeted banks and energy companies from issuing their own debt in European and U.S. capital markets (with some narrow exceptions for short-term debt), sanctioned banks such as VTB Bank have been able to act as book runners (that is, the main organizers) for the issuance of Russian sovereign debt that can be bought in the European Union and the United States.

On Tuesday, as the U.K. national security council met to decide on what steps to take next, the reality of the country’s diplomatic isolation was hitting home, with President Donald Trump and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Junker both having sent oleaginous congratulations to Putin for his recent re-election win. On Wednesday morning, the U.K. government announced it would ask for no further sanctions against the Russia state, but rather take action against Putin’s cronies and their dirty money in the United Kingdom. And the actions mentioned — “more security checks on private flights” and the like — will hardly keep those cronies awake at night.

The problem with the U.K. government’s response is that they are trying to use ordinary law enforcement to push back against the Russian hybrid threat. Of course, the government should move against dirty Russian money in the United Kingdom, but this is just to say that it should move against dirty money in the country in general: being a Russian national in the United Kingdom isn’t a crime, and nor is being a wealthy Russian national.

The crux of the matter is that the U.K. government is wrong to think it can push back against the Russian hybrid threat by focusing narrowly on the private actions of Putin’s entourage. This follows from the plain fact that these people occupy key positions in the Russian state, and state-linked companies. To counter the Russian hybrid threat, the United Kingdom and its Western partners need to hit back against the Russian state itself. In the immediate term, while it’s clear that there won’t be new sanctions, London should at least push to fix the weakness in the existing sanctions regimes against Russia as regards new sovereign debt issuances.

The easiest way to do that is to break the link between Russian sovereign debt and key Western clearing houses, such as Euroclear and Clearstream. At present, Russia can borrow in EU and U.S. capital markets despite Western sanctions and then can support the sanctioned Kremlin-linked banks and energy companies that can no longer do so. For instance, in July 2016, two months after Russia issued its first Eurodollar bond since the 2014 sanctions, it was made available on Euroclear. If Russian bonds were no longer available on such clearing houses, they would effectively be untradeable on the secondary market, which would deter the majority of EU and U.S. investors from buying them.

This can be achieved though re-interpretation, or slight modification, of the exiting sanctions regimes, which were ambiguous on the question of whether clearing houses would make Russian sovereign bonds available. Clearstream was well aware that it had been burnt for breaking the Iranian sanctions regime, and had to pay a $152 million fine to the U.S. Treasury in 2014. Nevertheless, in July 2016, two months after Russia issued its first Eurodollar bond since the 2014 sanctions, it was made available on Euroclear, surmounting the final obstacle to the Russian state accessing EU and U.S. capital markets.

Tightening existing sanctions in this way would also serve to strike against Russian dirty money in the United Kingdom. Last week’s Russian Eurobond week was different from previous issuances in the way it was designed to allow Russian investors to repatriate money held abroad and was expressly advertised as such by the head of VTB Bank, which acted as the book runner, and Putin himself.

Of course, the main problem remains that the U.K. is unlikely to get support from the United States or the EU at this time (note that London’s sanctions works within the EU sanctions regime).

On the U.S. side, the Trump administration is clearly reluctant to toughen existing sanctions on Russia. One reason for this is that it would disrupt financial markets, which would harm U.S. investors as well as the Russian state, as a key U.S. Treasury report stated in late January as part of a justification not to sanction Russian sovereign debt. One could argue this simply puts the interests of the U.S. economy first. But it also represents a spineless refusal to stand up to a mafia state. Indeed, it all but confirms Putin’s assumption that Western leaders are so nervous about upsetting financial markets that they will forfeit the only serious weapon they have to push back on illegal Russian activity short of military means. Of course, there is also President Donald Trump’s own strange deference to Putin in the background and links between his businesses and VTB Bank to consider.

On the European side, the U.K. has less influence given its imminent departure from the EU, and the EU itself is internally split on whether to upgrade or tone down Russian sanctions. However, while the sight of a President of the EU Commission congratulating a dictator on his election victory presents a vision of decay, there are braver voices willing to stand up for democracy against the Russian hybrid threat. For example, European Parliamentarian Guy Verhofstadt tweeted that “This is no time for congratulations. We will always need dialogue with Russia, but closer ties must be conditional on respect for the rules based international order & fundamental values”. Exactly right.

Realistically, the United Kingdom might not be able to get the existing sanctions regimes tweaked to cover new Russian sovereign debt issuance this time around, given the wider diplomatic situation. But London would be wrong to think that pushing for this now would display the London’s isolation, and the West’s disunity in the face of the Russian hybrid threat. Rather, it is the right moment for the United Kingdom to stand up for the move, and place the burden of explanation on those who think that it is fine for the West’s financial system to be used to finance a state that clearly presents a threat to Western democracies.

Germany, France, and Poland topped the charts of EU countries making expulsions, announcing they would each be sending four Russians out of their respective countries.

Lithuania and the Czech Republic both announced they would be expelling three diplomats. Meanwhile the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, and Spain jumped on board with two expelled diplomats per country.

Finland, Sweden, Romania, Croatia, and Hungary are expelling one each. Latvia also announced that it would be expelling one diplomat and an Aeroflot employee, and Estonia's foreign minister confirmed the country would be expelling a military attaché at the Russian embassy.

Ukraine, which is not an EU member state, announced it would be expelling 13 diplomats. Albania, another country which is not part of the bloc, said it would be expelling two. Norway said it would expel one.

Meanwhile, Iceland also said it is temporarily suspending its bilateral contacts with Russia at the highest level, TASS news agency reported, citing the Russian envoy to the country.

Further afield, Donald Trump has ordered the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the United States, as well as the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle.

Moscow will respond to the actions of each individual state that has expelled Russian diplomats, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

“Necessary steps will be made regarding each country involved, both on the diplomats’ expulsion, and on the closure of the Russian Consulate General in Seattle,” she promised.

Meanwhile, Austria said it won’t be joining the punitive measures against Russia, according to government spokesperson Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal. “We are determined to maintain open channels of dialogue with Russia,” he told RIA Novosti, adding that Austria is a “neutral country and a sort of bridge between the East and the West.” Vienna, however, stands by the decision to recall the EU’s ambassador from Russia, he added.

Western countries have pointed the finger at Russia over the poisoning of Skripal, a former double-agent, and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, UK on March 4. British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson went so far as to suggest the attack was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russia has denied playing a role in the poisoning, and has offered its full cooperation in the investigation. Moscow’s request for samples of the toxic agent used on Skripal and his daughter has been declined by Britain.",anti-russian,0

Nato has expelled seven Russian diplomats over the Salisbury nerve agent attack, the organisation’s secretary general has announced.

Accreditation requests from Moscow for three other officials have also been rejected to “send a clear message”, said Jens Stoltenberg, in the latest wave of global condemnation over the poisoning of Sergei Skripal.

He said the move was intended the show Vladimir Putin’s regime “that there are costs and consequences for its unacceptable and dangerous pattern of behaviour”.

It follows the “unprecedented” expulsions of more than 140 Russian diplomats from dozens of countries around in the world in a coordinated response to the 4 March assassination attempt that the British government says was planned by the Kremlin.

Nato’s decision reduces the maximum size of the Russian mission on the North Atlantic Council, its main decision-making body, from 30 to 20.

The move comes in light of “Russia’s lack of constructive response to what happened in Salisbury”, Mr Stoltenberg added.

Speaking in Brussels, he said: “The attack in Salisbury was the first use of a nerve agent on Nato territory. On 14 March, Nato allies made clear their deep concern, and condemnation of this reckless breach of international norms.

“Since then, intensive consultations have taken place among allies, including here at Nato and in capitals. Those consultations have resulted so far in the expulsion of over 140 Russian officials by over 25 Nato Allies and partners.

“This is a broad, strong and coordinated international response. And as part of that response, Nato is unified in taking further steps.

“I have today withdrawn the accreditation of seven staff at the Russian Mission to Nato. I will also deny the pending accreditation request for three others.”

He added: “This sends a clear message to Russia that there are costs and consequences for its unacceptable and dangerous pattern of behaviour. And it follows Russia’s lack of constructive response to what happened in Salisbury.

“Our actions reflect the serious security concerns expressed by all Allies, and are part of the coordinated international effort to respond to Russia’s behaviour.”

Although Mr Stoltenberg said the expulsions had been “triggered by the Salisbury attack”, he was clear that Nato’s member nations had already grown frustrated with Russian foreign policy.

“We have seen the illegal annexation of Crimea, we have seen the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, we have seen cyber attacks, we have seen hybrid tactics, we have seen Russia investing heavily in modern military equipment and the willingness to use military force against neighbours,” he said.

Theresa May on Tuesday hailed the “unprecedented series of expulsions” of Russian diplomats across the globe in the wake of the Salisbury attack.

The British prime minister said the international reaction “has demonstrated to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate their attempts to flout international law, undermine our values or threaten our security”.

She added: “It is also important to note that our partners are not only taking these measures out of solidarity with the UK, but also because they recognise the threat that these Russian networks pose to the security of their own countries and the pattern of Russian aggression which has affected us all.”

Her comments came as Ireland became the latest country to expel a Russian diplomat, a move the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said was a show of solidarity with the UK.

“Ireland is a neutral country, we do not join military alliances, we will not be joining Nato, we will not be part of a European army,” he said. “However, when it comes to terrorism, assassinations and the use of chemical weapons and cyber terrorism we are not neutral, one bit.”

On Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said his country was expelling two Russian diplomats whom he described as undeclared intelligence officers. They have been given seven days to leave Australia. Turnbull slammed Russia for “reckless and deliberate” conduct that he said harms global security and violates rules against the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Embassy in Canberra said the decision was regrettable and jeopardized bilateral relationships.

“It is astonishing how easily the allies of Great Britain follow it blindly contrary to the norms of civilized bilateral dialogue and international relations, and against ... common sense,” it said.

Ireland also announced it was ordering one Russian diplomat to leave. Foreign Minister Simon Coveney called the nerve-agent attack on Skripal and his daughter a “shocking and abhorrent” use of chemical weapons.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would expel seven staffers from the Russian mission and deny the pending accreditation requests of three other workers at the Russian mission.

Stoltenberg said “we will continue to work for meaningful dialogue” with Russia, but added that the measures announced Tuesday should “send a very clear message to Russia that it has costs.”

“I actually think that Russia has underestimated the unity of NATO allies,” he said.

Moldova, the ex-Soviet nation whose pro-Western government is seeking closer ties with the West, on Tuesday also ordered three Russian diplomats to leave the former Soviet republic within seven days.

The Skripals remain hospitalized in critical condition after they were found unconscious on March 4 in the English city of Salisbury, where the former spy lived. Britain says they were poisoned with a Soviet-made military-grade nerve agent known as Novichok.

Moscow has dismissed the British accusations as baseless, saying that it fully destroyed its Soviet-era chemical arsenals last year.

Russia’s foreign minister blamed the U.S. for blackmailing its allies to expel Russian diplomats.

Speaking on a trip to Uzbekistan, Sergei Lavrov said the U.S. has applied “colossal pressure, colossal blackmail, which have become Washington’s main instrument on the international arena.”

If Sergei and Yulia Skripal survive being poisoned by Novichok nerve agent, they may be left suffering illnesses that ruin their lives – which may be the point of the attack, security experts have warned.

The case of a Russian military scientist accidentally exposed to Novichok appears to show that even surviving the effects of the supertoxic nerve agent is horrific.

Andrei Zheleznyakov was said to have been injected with an antidote almost immediately, but a friend said he still went from being a jovial, creative man to suffering “chronic weakness, toxic hepatitis, epilepsy, severe depression and an inability to concentrate”, before dying five years later.

And The Independent has been told that the Salisbury nerve agent attack may have been part of a plan to leave a Mafia-style “calling card” showing anyone, anywhere in the world that if they betrayed or defied Russia, they wouldn’t just get a bullet in the back of the head – they would die horribly.

Dr Patricia Lewis, research director for International Security at Chatham House, said whoever used a Novichok chemical against the Skripals would have known it would be traced back to Russia.

She said British experts would have been able to detect minute trace elements proving the nerve agent’s country of origin, and would therefore have been able to rule out the possibility it was from stocks developed by other nations for the purposes of devising defences against it.

The experts, she said, would not just have relied on the fact Russia was the country which developed Novichok. “There are ways to detect and be much more sure about where it came from,” said Dr Lewis, who served on the 2004-6 WMD Commission chaired by Dr Hans Blix.

“There are very high resolution analysis techniques that can track down trace elements, certain types of chemicals in the particular region where it has been made.”

“Russia knows there are techniques to pinpoint where something came from,” Dr Lewis added. “Whoever did this would know this was traceable back to Russia. So why use such an obvious thing, leaving such an obvious trace?”

One possible reason, said Dr Lewis, could have been a desire to send a strong message. “This clearly wasn’t just a bullet to the head,” she said. “This was a communication – along with the polonium attack [on Alexander Litvinenko] – that this is going to be a horrible way to die.

“The communication is there to people who have, in their view, betrayed Russia. It’s a very Mafia-type approach, by people who want to frighten.”

The experience of Andrei Zheleznyakov appears to suggest the effects of Novichok can be horrific even if you survive.

Mr Zheleznyakov is understood to have been a military chemist, testing the “finished product” as it was being developed in secret in Moscow.

According to an account relayed by Vil Mirzayanov to David E Hoffman, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy, Zheleznyakov was exposed after a ventilation pipe broke at the secret facility in 1987.

“The pipe somehow broke,” Hoffman wrote, “And the poison leaked into the air. Zheleznyakov quickly sealed the leak, but it was too late. He felt the impact immediately – myosis, the constriction of the pupil of the eye.

“‘I saw rings before my eyes – red, orange,” he later recalled. “Bells were ringing inside my head. I choked. Add to this the feeling of fear – as if something was about to happen at any moment. I sat down and told the guys: I think it has ‘got’ me.

“’They dragged me out of the room and took me to the chief. He looked at me and said, ‘Have a cup of tea, everything will be fine.’ I drank the tea and immediately threw up.

“’They took me to the medical unit,’ he added, ‘where I was injected with an antidote. I felt a little better. The chief told me: ‘Go home and lie down. Come back tomorrow.’

“’They assigned me an escort, and we walked past a few bus stops. We were already passing the church near Ilyich Square, when suddenly I saw the church lighting up and falling apart. I remember nothing else.’”

Hoffman said Zheleznyakov was taken to a hospital where KGB agents made the doctors sign lifelong secrecy agreements, and told medics the military chemist was suffering from food poisoning after eating a dodgy sausage.

Zheleznyakov, it seems, spent 18 days in intensive care but survived. His life, however, appears to have been ruined.

Using information from Mirzayanov, who now lives in the US after revealing the existence of the Novichok programme in 1992, Hoffman wrote: “At the end of the hospitalisation, he [Zheleznyakov] was given a pension and told to remain silent.

“Zheleznyakov suffered after-effects for a long time, including chronic weakness in his arms, toxic hepatitis, epilepsy, severe depression and an inability to concentrate.

“Zheleznyakov had been a jovial man and was known as a talented woodcarver, but the accident left him unable to work or be creative. He died five years after the accident.”

Major General Chip Chapman, the former head of counter terrorism at the Ministry of Defence, agreed it was likely that part of the motivation for using such a devastating weapon was to intimidate potential internal and external opponents of Vladimir Putin’s government.

Mr Chapman said: “The use of any chemical agent is a psychological thing, and this is a psychological message, not necessarily to Britain, but to those who are political opponents or potential traitors to the Russians in any country.

“It sends a message a lot wider than just to the UK audience. It is part of what the Russians are up to at the moment.”

Dr Lewis stressed she could only speculate about motive and the identity of whoever attacked the Skripals.

She couldn’t entirely rule out the possibility that rogue elements in the Russian establishment had acted without the approval of Vladimir Putin’s government, but she said such a freelance operation was unlikely.

State-sponsored action, she said, was the more likely scenario.

“This stuff is very dangerous,” said Dr Lewis. “It would be highly guarded. The idea that somehow it was let out by rogue elements seems a bit of a stretch.”

On Wednesday, Britain issued its official retaliation to the attempted poisoning of an ex-Soviet spy on its soil: Prime Minister Theresa May ordered 23 Russian diplomats — deemed “undeclared intelligence officers” — expelled from the country, a move that immediately drew comparisons to the Cold War.

Britain believes that Russia is behind the use of a Russian nerve agent in the cathedral city of Salisbury as part of an attempt to assassinate Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The attack left the pair comatose and in critical condition, while forcing 18 others to receive medical treatment.

“May repeated the conclusion of British investigators that Russia had either deployed or lost control of a dangerous nerve agent used in the attack — targeting the former spy and his daughter — and said Russia’s defiant response has 'demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events,' "" my colleagues in London reported. In addition to the expulsions, the largest of their kind in Britain since 1985, Britain is imposing a host of other relatively minor penalties.

Moscow, which has a track record of striking at targets living in Britain, denied any involvement in the episode, and senior Russian officials ignored an ultimatum for an explanation of the incident. Meanwhile, its media outlets and diplomatic corps voiced outrage — and plenty of ridicule.

As a range of Kremlin mouthpieces decried mounting Russophobia in the West and the Russian Embassy in London described the new punitive measures as ""totally unacceptable, unjustified and shortsighted,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry mocked Britain's finger-pointing.

The Russians, May lamented to Parliament, “have treated the use of a military-grade nerve agent in Europe with sarcasm, contempt and defiance.”

There are clear reasons why the Russians seem to be taking the situation lightly. Russian President Vladimir Putin is on the campaign trail less than a week from an almost-certain reelection, and would hardly want to strike a conciliatory tone against the foreign governments he loves to challenge. His politics are built on a defiant nationalism, drawing on both a desire to revive Russia's lost imperial glory as well as lingering resentment of the West.

In 1992, two Russian scientists approached The Post’s Will Englund, then the Moscow correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, with news of a secret nerve agent. (Video: Joyce Lee, Will Englund/The Washington Post)

“The trouble is that Russia probably doesn’t much worry about diplomatic expulsions, and British sanctions would add little to the broad range of Western sanctions already in place over the annexation of Crimea,” a New York Times editorial noted this week. “Yet if Russia’s message is that no 'traitor' is safe anywhere, it should be in the interest of every nation to send an indelible message to Mr. Putin that he cannot deploy his weapons of war anywhere he wants.”

On Wednesday, a session of the United Nations Security Council offered tough rhetoric on Russia but little meaningful action. There's no consensus within the European Union over new potential sanctions on Russia, and the tortured negotiations over Brexit has fundamentally impaired May's ability to coordinate collective action.

“The episode underlines the extent to which UK’s post-Brexit foreign and security relations with the EU remain unresolved,” wrote Patrick Wintour, the Guardian's diplomatic editor. “Britain as a third party would not be automatically consulted on common foreign and security policy, including further sanctions coordination, but both sides have been deferring talks until the outline of a trade deal becomes clearer.”

Further complicating the situation is the sheer weight of the Russian presence in Britain. For more than a decade, London has seen the ceaseless arrival of wealthy Russian emigres, including oligarchs fleeing the Kremlin and those still in Putin's good graces. With what some critics claim are looted assets, they have reshaped the British capital's real estate market and social scene — and led to a proliferation of spooks.

“Russia now has more intelligence agents deployed in London than at the height of the Cold War,” Ellen Barry of the New York Times reported. “They serve a variety of functions, including building contacts among British politicians. But the most important task is to keep an eye on the hundreds of heavyweight Russians — those aligned with President Vladimir V. Putin, and those arrayed against him — who have built lives in Britain, attracted by its property market and banking system.”

It’s unclear whether May will consider any further action on pro-Putin oligarchs living within Britain, but she said that she believed the country’s money-laundering laws were strong enough to deal with “corrupt elites.” Some prominent Russian journalists saw that as mere avoidance.

London is the de-facto capital of the post-Soviet mafia state. It accumulates a lion’s share of oligarchic assets from everywhere in ex-USSR. But why tackle that, when you can pretend it’s another Cold War. That’s British government’s reaction to Skripal poisoning in a nutshell. — Leonid Ragozin (@leonidragozin) March 14, 2018

In the end, of course, it’ll be ordinary Russians who will suffer because punitive bureaucracy always goes for the lowest hanging fruit. Why bother with corrupt officials when you can just arbitrarily reject student visa applications and break up families. — Alexey Kovalyov (@Alexey__Kovalev) March 14, 2018

Putin’s most vocal opponent, anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, also expressed his concerns about the thrust of the Western response. “One scenario, as it seems to me, is Putin's comfortable scenario,” he told ABC News this week, gesturing at symbolic sanctions and the sort of expulsions ordered Wednesday.

“There is a second option,” he said, “that would really be painful for Putin and his corrupt circle that consists of applying targeted sanctions on those oligarchs and state officials whose families have been based for a very long time in Great Britain.” Those do not seem to be in the cards yet.

Meanwhile, even as his lieutenants criticized Moscow, President Trump was slow to denounce what could be a state-sponsored Russian attack on the soil of one of his nation's closest allies. The administration waited until Wednesday evening to blame Russia for the attack. Trump often leaps to conclusions about Islamist terrorist attacks before all the facts are known. His relative caution in this case is conspicuous to European observers — and another indication of a larger, more troubling rift.

“Trump’s mixture of hostility and indifference to the European project, its trading power and its liberal, democratic values, is hardly news,” wrote Natalie Nougayrède, the former editor of French daily Le Monde. “But with the early signs of a trade war, and the growing evidence of the president’s disdain for Britain’s predicament just when transatlantic empathy was expected, we see his estrangement from historical norms in sharp focus.”

Experts at the Chemical Research Institute near Nukus, Uzbekistan, would make the dogs wear gas masks and walk on treadmills during the experiments.

They would give the animals Novichok, which was used to attack former double agent Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia in Salisbury.

The centre was built by the Soviets to create the nerve agent and it was abandoned by the Red Army in 1992.

She went to the centre after the Soviet Union collapsed and said: 'I saw hundreds of small cages where the dogs were held and 25 miniature treadmills.

'The dogs were strapped to them and crammed into gas masks. Thousands died from exposure to the agent.'

Thousands of dogs were forced to walk on treadmills and were given Novichok at the Shikhany Institute in south eastern Russia (pictured)

Double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia (pictured together) are still fighting for their lives in hospital

Mr Skripal and his daughter are still fighting for their lives in hospital following the incident which shocked the world.

And it has now emerged that Yulia was in a relationship with a man who is believed to have been working for Vladimir Putin.

Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson today said that experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will come to the UK.

They will arrive in Britain on Monday to test samples of the nerve agent used in the poisoning.

Last week, the National Security Council recommended President Trump take action against Russia; several sources told CNN that expelling diplomatic workers would be “the most severe response under consideration.” At the same time, another source claimed that members of the National Security Council and State Department were engaged in talks with their European counterparts to determine how many they were going to expel.

On March 24, Bloomberg reported, citing two sources with knowledge of the situation, that Trump was preparing to expel “dozens” of Russian diplomats in response to the alleged poisoning attack on Sergei Skripal.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said that Moscow was “highly likely” behind the poisoning, stating that the police had found the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, allegedly developed in Russia, at the site. She then ordered the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats, which was backed by the European Council.

Moscow, in turn, has strongly denied the accusations, offering assistance in investigating the incident, as well as requesting the samples of the chemical substance in question; the UK, however, declined all request. As a response to the UK’s measures, Russia declared 23 British diplomats personae non gratae, and revoked its agreement on the UK General Consulate’s operation in St. Petersburg.

Two Russian scientists have contradicted the Kremlin’s claims that there was never a state programme to make the deadly nerve agent Novichok, both independently stating that they were involved in the poison’s creation at chemicals weapons laboratories in the Soviet era.

Moscow has denied any involvement in the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, who were found unconscious on a bench on 4 March in the Wiltshire city.

Vladimir Putin’s administration has repeatedly denied any involvement in the case and has said neither Russia nor the Soviet Union developed Novichok at all.

“Russia does not possess such agents. We have destroyed all our chemical arsenals under control of international observers,” Mr Putin said at a press conference following his re-election as President on Sunday evening.

His remarks followed those of Alexander Shulgin, Russian ambassador to the Netherlands and Russia’s representative at the Organisation for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Last week he said: “There has never been any programme under the group name 'Novichok' in the Russian Federation,” He added: “Back to 1992, Russia stopped all the activities in the area of military chemistry.”

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson accused Russia of building a “haystack of lies” to cover its involvement in the poisoning.

On Tuesday the UK’s Foreign Office said: “Instead of providing an explanation for the Salisbury incident, Russia has launched a campaign of disinformation.”

But independent Russian news outlet The Bell tracked down a scientist named Vladimir Uglev who said he worked on a programme beginning in the 1970s to create toxins to rival the US military’s VX nerve agent.

Mr Uglev said Novichok, meaning “novice”, was the name used for several substances developed in a laboratory in Russia’s Saratov region 600km southwest of Moscow.

In addition, RIA Novosti, a state-run Russian news agency, spoke to Cold War-era scientist Professor Leonid Rink who also said he had worked to create the nerve agent and named the same part of Russia as the location of the lab in which it was made, Reuters reports.

When asked if he was one of Novichok’s creators he said: “Yes. It was the basis for my doctoral dissertation.”

“A big group of specialists in Shikhany and in Moscow worked on Novichok – on the technologies, toxicologies and biochemistry,” he said. “In the end we achieved very good results.”

But he said it was “hard to believe” Mr Putin’s administration was behind the attack, and echoed theories seen on Russian state media that the British could have been behind the attack.

“It's hard to believe that the Russians were involved, given that all of those caught up in the incident are still alive,” he said. “Such outrageous incompetence by the alleged (Russian) spies would have simply been laughable and unacceptable.”

He also said it would be the “height of idiocy” for Russia to use Novichok given its obvious connection to Russia.

“There are lots of more suitable substances,” he said. “To fire the equivalent of a powerful rocket at someone who is not a threat and to miss would be the height of idiocy.”

Though the formula for the nerve agent was once secret, Rink said other countries including Britain, the US and China were now capable of manufacturing versions of the substance, however, analysis of the poison used in Salisbury should reveal whether or not it was “cooked up” in Russia.

Rink himself has a previous conviction for supplying poisons used in murders. In 1995 he confessed to having secretly supplied a military-grade poison for cash that was used to murder a Russian banking magnate and his secretary.

In a statement to investigators after his arrest, Rink said he was in possession of poisons created as part of the chemical weapons programme which he stored in his garage, according to Reuters.

Rink received a one-year suspended prison sentence for “misuse of powers” after a secret trial, according to a lawyer involved in the case.

Mr Uglev, the other scientist, confirmed he had worked at the same research institute as Rink, and told The Bell only “a few dozen people” alive can be familiar with the chemical composition for Novichok. He also suggested that the reason UN chemical weapons inspectors had not found the nerve agent was because there had been no production in soviet Satellite states and because by 2011, production had also ceased in Russia.

In addition, the substance was never declared to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Only declared weapons in Russia’s chemical arsenal were destroyed.

He also explained that of the four variants of Novichok, only the latest iteration - first made in 1980 - can be a powder. The three earlier versions were liquids, he said.

Speaking about the victims of the Salisbury attack, Mr Uglev said the outlook was dire.

“There is no antidote for these substances. With a probability of close to 100% I can say that as soon as the father and daughter of the Violins are disconnected from life support systems, they will die.”

Scientists from the OPCW have been invited to the UK and begun tests on the substance to assess its provenance.

IT WAS Britain, not Russia, that poisoned Sergei Skripal and his daughter, to stoke Russophobia. Or perhaps Ukraine targeted the former spy, to frame Russia. Then again, maybe the Skripals were accidentally exposed to a British nerve-agent, produced at Porton Down laboratory. Or maybe the culprits were the daughter’s half-crazy fiancé and his mother, who did it out of jealousy. After all, Russia does not produce the Novichok nerve-agent that is said to have been used. And in any case it was not Novichok at all, but a toxin called BZ, as a Swiss laboratory secretly confirmed.

These are some of the claims made by Russia’s state media, its foreign ministry and by online trolls following last month’s assassination attempt on a former Russian spy in Salisbury. Their contradictory character is not a flaw of the Kremlin’s propaganda, but a feature. The purpose of the disinformation campaign is to drown Western intelligence in a cacophony of wild claims, rather than offer a coherent counter-narrative. Russia has used the tactic before, during the wars in Ukraine (including the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17) and Syria. The stories are regularly collated by Britain’s Foreign Office.

Earlier this year the Russian embassy in the Netherlands tweeted a suggested slogan to describe its foreign policy: “Russia’s strength is in truth”. It was unclear whether the nod to George Orwell was intentional. But Russian officials have barely hidden their engagement in information warfare, claiming that Russia is under attack from the Western media, which wants to stir trouble. In so doing, they project Russia’s own tactics onto other countries.

Thus, Britain and France staged a chemical attack in Douma, Syria, and used a fake YouTube video to justify their strikes with America on April 14th. “This is an established fact,” asserted Dmitry Kiselev, the anchor of Russia’s main weekly TV news show. The media first said that there was no evidence of the use of chemical weapons in Syria, before adopting the line that the evidence was fabricated by Britain.

Both the poisoning of the Skripals and the attack on Syria, Mr Kiselev claimed, were “Anglo-Saxon provocations”, led by “petty Britain” with America participating in its “devilish plot”. (The world, he added, was lucky to have so sober and restrained a leader as Vladimir Putin.) The studio backdrop showed Big Ben and an old Russian saying, Anglichanka gadit (an Englishwoman makes mischief), which was first applied to Queen Victoria after she humiliated Russia in the Crimean war of 1853-56.

Victoria is not the only Anglichanka said to have made mischief in Russia. The largest pro-Kremlin tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, last month ran a long interview with a “historian of intelligence services”, who claimed that Elizabeth I dispatched her physicians to the “noble and kind” Tsar Ivan IV (better known as Ivan the Terrible), to poison him and his wife with mercury. “The English had every reason to poison Ivan the Terrible. He started to display independence, stripped English merchants of their privileges and contradicted the queen herself,” the historian explained. English spies, disguised as merchants, were also behind the so-called time of troubles, a spell of famine and uprising in the early 17th century, he added.

All this is framed as a historical precedent to the supposed plot by another Anglichanka,Theresa May, to poison the image of Russia’s modern tsar, Mr Putin, by unleashing a nerve agent on the Skripals. But the real history is somewhat different, and perhaps telling. In his letters to Elizabeth I, Ivan proposed to marry the English queen, and asked her for shelter in case he met trouble at home. She turned him down.",anti-russian,0
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/police-five-key-locations-salisbury-in-skripal-attempted-case,8,8,"The investigation into the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia appears to be focusing on five key scenes: his home, the spot where the pair fell ill, the two places they ate and drank before their collapse, and his BMW car.

Skripal’s road on the outskirts of Salisbury remains sealed off and detectives and experts in protective hazmat suits continue to comb his modern red-brick home and question neighbours and his friends.

On Wednesday, investigators in hazmat suits returned after dark to the bench in the Maltings shopping centres where Skripal, 66, and Yulia, 33, became ill and removed items in plastic bags.

Police have also launched a specific appeal for anyone who saw the Skripals in the BMW in the 45 minutes before they arrived in the Maltings on the afternoon they fell ill – Sunday 4 March. The Zizzi restaurant and Mill pub, which the pair visited, are still cordoned off.

Hundreds of officers including counter-terrorism detectives, local police, forensic experts, intelligence analysts and the military are involved in the search for evidence of who exactly carried out the attack – and how.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the now-disbanded Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, said he believed the nerve agent novichok that was used was probably in powder form. “That seems to be the most plausible thing,” he said.

Theories have been swirling around Salisbury about how the novichok may have been delivered, including on the BMW’s door handles, steering wheel, or in its ventilation system. But the Guardian understands that the police officer taken ill, DS Nick Bailey, may have fallen ill after visiting his home, suggesting that the house remains crucial.

De Bretton-Gordon said it was “plausible” that the nerve agent could have arrived in the post or in a gift. “You open a letter and the stuff goes all over the place,” he said.

“It is equally plausible that an agent could have delivered it. You only need to drop a small amount in someone’s pocket or brush past them.”

Scotland Yard, clarifying elements of the case’s timeline, confirmed Yulia arrived in the UK at 2.40pm on 3 March – 24 hours before the pair fell ill.

Officers are examining many hundreds of hours of CCTV footage to trace Yulia’s movements before and after she arrived in Salisbury. However, it seems unlikely that the nerve agent would have been sent into the UK on or with her. Had something gone wrong on a crowded international flight, it would have been a disaster.

It is clear the investigation remains very fluid.

Quick Guide Timeline: the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal Show 1.30pm Police have confirmed that Skripal and his daughter were in Salisbury city centre by 1.30pm. It is not known if they walked from his home or whether they drove or were driven in. Between 1.30pm and around 4pm Skripal and his daughter strolled around Salisbury and visited the Zizzi restaurant on Castle Street and the nearby Mill pub. They are believed to have been in Zizzi for about 40 minutes from 2.30pm. 3.47pm A CCTV camera at Snap Fitness in Market Walk captured two people initially thought to be Skripal and his daughter. The woman appeared to be carrying a red handbag. Later it became clear the pair were probably not the Russian and his daughter. Police have been keen to speak to the couple. 4.03pm The same camera caught personal trainer Freya Church. She turned left out of the gym and in front of her saw Skripal and the woman on a bench at the Maltings shopping centre. She said the woman had passed out and the man was behaving strangely. Church walked on. 4.08pm Footage that emerged on Friday from a local business showed that people were still strolling casually through Market Walk. Approx 4.15pm A member of the public dialled 999. The Friday footage shows an emergency vehicle racing through the pedestrianised arcade shortly after 4.15pm. A paramedic also ran through. Police and paramedics worked on the couple at the scene for almost an hour in ordinary uniforms. 5.11pm The woman was airlifted to hospital; Skripal was taken by road. 5.13pm Images taken by a passerby show that officers were still clearly unaware of the severity of the situation. They did not have specialist protective clothing and members of the public also strolled nearby. 5.48pm Police told Salisbury Journal they were investigating a possible drug-related incident. At about this time officers identified Skripal and his daughter and by Sunday evening they were at his home – in normal uniform or street clothes. At some point DS Nick Bailey, now seriously ill in hospital, visited the Skripal house, but it is not known where he was contaminated. Approx 8.20pm Officers donned protective suits to examine the bench and surrounding areas. By 9pm Officers were hosing themselves down. It was not until the next day that a major incident was declared. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

Attention seemed to home in on the BMW on Thursday – four days after the pair were taken ill – when teams of Met counter-terrorism officers and military experts in hazmat suits arrived at the Ashley Wood recovery garage on the Churchfields industrial estate in Salisbury to examine the car and take it away. Paramedics stood by while the work was done.

Eight days after the collapse on Monday, officers and troops in hazmat suits appeared in the village of Winterslow, six miles north-east of Salisbury where they worked on an Ashley Wood van. Later that day, back in the city, the first floor of the Sainsbury’s car park was cordoned off and a police tent set up covering the car park’s ticket machine.

It is now known that this is where the Skripals parked at approximately 1.40pm on Sunday 4 March before going to the Mill Pub then on to the Zizzi restaurant.

Father and daughter stayed at Zizzi until about 3.35pm and emergency services were called to the bench in the Maltings where they were taken ill at 4.15pm.

Police are particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw the Skripals in the BMW – registration plate HD09 WAO – between 1pm on Sunday and the time they arrived in the city centre. They are also working hard to track the pair around Salisbury during the 40 minutes after they left Zizzi and before they fell ill on the Maltings bench.",neutral,1

The Foreign Office tweeted Wednesday morning that the British government has called for an urgent UNSC meeting over the attack. Prime Minister Theresa May alleges that it was either authorized by the Russian government or Moscow allowed the nerve agent to fall into the wrong hands.

May set a deadline of midnight Tuesday for Russia to provide an explanation for the “poisoning” of Skripal and his daughter, and expelled 23 Russian diplomats when the deadline was missed. Speaking on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is ready to respond to to any official request from London but Moscow has yet to receive any such contact regarding the case. Moscow denies any involvement in the incident.

“Allegations, not confession, are merely the queen of evidence of the UK,” the minister said at a press conference. “We will uphold international law and we don’t see that our British partners have any arguments on the case,” he added.

Lavrov said the case must come before the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons (OPCW), of which both Russia and the UK are members.

Moscow refused to respond to the accusation Tuesday, unless it received a sample of the toxic substance.

""Russia is ready to cooperate in accordance with the convention to ban chemical weapons if the United Kingdom will deign to fulfill its obligations according to the same convention,"" Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a press conference Tuesday, according to Gizmodo, even as Lavrov denied Russia was involved in the attack on former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.

“Russia is not responsible,” he said.

British Prime Minister Theresa May, in an address to Parliament Monday, identified the nerve agent used in the poisoning as the Russian-made Novichok, and gave Moscow 24 hours to explain the attack on the former spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England.

""Should there be no credible response, we will conclude that this action amounts to an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom, and I will come back to this House and set out the full range of measures we will take in response,"" May said in her address, according to The New York Times.

What is Novichok?

-The nerve agent Novichok, which means “newcomer” in Russian, is one of the deadliest chemical weapons ever developed.

-It was reportedly created and produced in top secret labs by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s, at the end of the Cold War.

-Novichok is actually a class of agents that was reportedly developed to get around the Chemical Weapons Treaty, according to Science Direct. The engineers changed the chemical structure to create a new agent that was not subject to chemical treaties, the website reported.

-The Novichok agents were created to be undetectable by standard detection equipment.

-The toxin is generally dispersed as a fine powder, rather than a gas or vapor.

-Exposure usually occurs through inhalation, but it can also be absorbed through the skin or mucous membrane.

-It’s a fast-acting poison that usually affects the victim in under two minutes, leading to respiratory or cardiac arrest.

-There is an antidote for Novichok agents, but the nerve toxins can cause permanent injury.

Novichok sounds pretty grim: it's reportedly 10 times more potent than VX, more resistant to antidotes & more difficult to detect than other nerve agents.

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/18/vladimir-putin-nonsense-to-think-russia-would-poison-spy-in-uk,119,108,"Vladimir Putin said on Sunday it was nonsense to think that Moscow would have poisoned the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, who are critically ill in a British hospital.

The UK government has said that the Skripals were poisoned by the Soviet-era novichok nerve agent, and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said on Sunday that Russia has been stockpiling it and investigating how such weapons could be used in assassinations.

But Putin, in his first detailed comments on the poisoning, said Russia had been falsely accused.

“As for the tragedy that you mentioned, I found out about it from the media. The first thing that entered my head was that if it had been a military-grade nerve agent, the people would have died on the spot,” said Putin.

“Secondly, Russia does not have such [nerve] agents. We destroyed all our chemical weapons under the supervision of international organisations and we did it first, unlike some of our partners who promised to do it, but unfortunately did not keep their promises.”

Despite the tensions, Putin said Moscow was ready to cooperate with London: “We are ready to cooperate, we said that straight away. We are ready to take part in the necessary investigations, but for that there needs be a desire from the other side and we don’t see that yet. But we are not taking it off the agenda, joint efforts are possible.”

“I think any sensible person would understand that it would be rubbish, drivel, nonsense, for Russia to embark on such an escapade on the eve of a presidential election.”

Putin was speaking after winning a new term in a presidential election.

British officials have said Moscow was culpable for the poisoning, and expelled 23 Russian diplomats based in London. Moscow retaliated on Saturday by expelling the same number of British diplomats from Moscow, shuttering the British consulate in Russia’s second city of St Petersburg and closing down the Russian activities of the British Council, which promoted British culture overseas.",neutral,1

Yulia Skripal, 33, came round briefly after being admitted to hospital earlier this month before falling back into a coma, The Times reported.

The father and daughter were rendered unconscious after being attacked with a nerve agent in Salisbury.

According to The Times Mr Skripal and his daughter may have permanent brain damage, according to evidence given at a closed-door court hearing this week.

Following a hearing in the Court of Protection, where issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions are considered, Mr Justice Williams gave doctors permission to take blood samples from Mr Skripal and his daughter so tests can be carried out by chemical weapons experts.

Theresa May has slapped Vladimir Putin with a deadline over the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal.

The nerve agent attack on the double agent and his daughter Yulia ‘clearly came from Russia’ and ‘certainly will trigger a response’, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said.

Mr Tillerson’s comments amount to the strongest US response yet to Mrs May’s declaration that it was ‘highly likely’ Russia was behind the horrific poisoning in Salisbury on March 4.

The Prime Minister told MPs that the highly dangerous substance used in the attack was a military-grade Novichok nerve agent produced by Russia.

She set a deadline of midnight on Tuesday for Moscow to explain whether it was behind the attack or had lost control of its stockpile of the poison.

Failure to provide a ‘credible’ response would lead her to view the incident as ‘an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the United Kingdom’, sparking unspecified measures in reprisal.

Russia has demanded access to samples of the nerve agent that poisoned ex-spy Skripal, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said.

Investigations continue into the nerve-agent poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia (Picture: AP)

A meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergencies committee in Whitehall on Tuesday morning will be chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd, to discuss the latest developments.

Mr Tillerson told journalists travelling with him in Africa that the Novichok agent was ‘only in the hands of a very, very limited number of parties’.

Liz is 'frit': Truss won't answer Starmer's urgent question and sends Mordaunt instead

Although he said it ‘clearly came from Russia’, he added that he did not know whether Vladimir Putin’s government had knowledge of the poisoning and said it was ‘almost beyond comprehension’ that a state actor would use such a dangerous substance in a public place.

‘We have full confidence in the UK’s investigation and its assessment that Russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack that took place in Salisbury last week.

‘Those responsible – both those who committed the crime and those who ordered it – must face appropriately serious consequences. We stand in solidarity with our Allies in the United Kingdom and will continue to co-ordinate closely our responses,’ the US Secretary of State said.

French president Emmanuel Macron also offered his country’s solidarity with the UK in a phone call with Mrs May, in which he said that Paris would ‘co-ordinate closely’ with London following Russia’s response.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘They discussed the wide pattern of aggressive Russian behaviour and agreed that it would be important to continue to act in concert with allies to address it.’

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said: ‘The use of any nerve agent is horrendous and completely unacceptable. The UK is a highly valued ally, and this incident is of great concern to Nato. Nato is in touch with the UK authorities on this issue.’

Mrs May’s dramatic statement to the Commons on Monday came after Mr Johnson summoned Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko to the Foreign Office to voice Britain’s outrage, giving him little more than 24 hours to provide Moscow’s response.

The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the nerve agent attack on Mr Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer who was jailed as a double agent before being sent to the West in a 2010 spy swap.

Following Mrs May’s statement, news agency Tass quoted Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying: ‘It is a circus show in the British Parliament.

‘The conclusion is obvious, it’s another political information campaign, based on a provocation.’

And Mr Putin dismissed questions about the Skripals when he was confronted during an election campaign visit, telling the BBC: ‘Get to the bottom of things there, then we’ll discuss this.’

https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/04/10/ex-russian-spys-daughter-released-from-uk-hospital-after-poisoning-attack.html,222,13,"LONDON—The spy saga that set off international tumult last month took a positive turn Tuesday as Yulia Skripal was released from a British hospital more than a month after she and her father were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent.

“This is not the end of her treatment, but marks a significant milestone,” Salisbury District Hospital medical director Christine Blanshard said after the 33-year-old Skripal was discharged and taken to a secure location.

Blanshard would not provide details about Yulia Skripal’s condition for reasons of patient privacy. Sergei Skripal, 66, the apparent target of the March 4 attack, is recovering more slowly than his daughter but continues to improve, she said.

Poisoned ex-Russian spy no longer in critical condition, U.K. hospital says

Britain and U.S. spreading ‘lies and disinformation’ about poisoning of ex-spy: Russian foreign minister

No date has been set for his discharge, the doctor said.

“Both patients have responded exceptionally well to the treatment we’ve been providing. But equally, both patients are at different stages in their recovery,” she said.

The father and daughter were found unconscious on a bench and remained in critical condition for several weeks. Their poisoning has revived Cold War tensions between Russia and the West.

The British government is likely to keep details about Yulia Skripal’s location secret, given the sensitivity of the case. It accuses Russia of carrying out the attack, which Moscow vehemently denies.

If she is well enough, she is likely to be extensively questioned by British security officials and police about her recollection of events leading up to her poisoning.

The Russian Embassy in London tweeted its congratulations to Yulia Skripal, but said pointedly that Russia needs “urgent proof” that “what is being done to her is done on her own free will.”

The embassy accused British authorities of “concealing important evidence and blocking an impartial and independent investigation” by isolating the woman.

It reaffirmed its request for consular access to her. She is a Russian citizen.

It is not clear where the Skripals will live if they recover enough to resume normal activities. British officials may feel Sergei Skripal would not be safe to live openly in England any longer.

Bob Ayers, a security analyst who used to work with the CIA, said it is possible the Skripals would be given new identities in Britain or the United States under a program like those used to protect witnesses in high-profile criminal trials.

They could also choose to live in the open under the assumption that Russia would not attack a second time, he said.

“They may not want to go into hiding,” Ayers said. “Now that the assassination attempt has been uncovered, the odds are pretty good the Russians won’t take another run at them. They’ll be under surveillance, the cops will put cameras up, they’ll keep good track of the Skripals.”

He said he would not expect Yulia Skripal to return to Russia despite her Russian nationality.

In a later tweet, the Russian Embassy said any attempt to settle her in another country would be regarded as “abduction.”

British police say the lethal nerve agent Novichok was placed on the door handle of Sergei Skripal’s house in Salisbury, an English city 160 kilometres west of London.

The nerve agent also sickened Nick Bailey, a police detective who came to their aid. He was the first of the three to be released from the hospital.

Yulia Skripal arrived in England from Moscow the day before the attack to spend Easter with her father

Sergei Skripal is a former Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted in Russia of spying for Britain.

He was imprisoned in Russia and eventually settled in England after a 2010 “spy swap.”

He was living under his own name in Salisbury, apparently believing he would be safe because there was no known history of Russia attacking former spies who had been part of exchanges.

The British government maintains the Skripals were poisoned by a military-grade nerve agent that could only have been made in Russia. Russia has denied the allegation.

The incident has led to a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats from countries aligned with Britain. Russia in turn retaliated by expelling diplomats from countries that sided with Britain.

There are still many unanswered questions about the brazen attack.

If Britain is correct that the Russian government is to blame, it is not clear why Sergei Skripal was poisoned now, some eight years after his swap.

Some analysts believe Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to send a message to others who had betrayed Russia that they are not safe anywhere in the world. Others believe Sergei Skripal might have been involved in some private business that made Russian officials uneasy.

British officials have also not revealed how the Novichok was brought into Britain.

The Labour leader believes British intelligence officials could be wrong, according to his spokesperson.

Corbyn believes the attack could have been carried out by another eastern European state or the mafia.

Theresa May said she was ""surprised and shocked"" by the comments.

LONDON — Jeremy Corbyn believes there is not enough evidence to conclude that Russia was culpable for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter.

Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons today that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for the attack in Salisbury last week and will be subject to a series of punitive measures.

However, shortly after May's speech, a spokesperson for Corbyn told publications including Business Insider that the Labour leader did not believe there was sufficient proof to conclude that Russia carried out the poisoning, suggesting that British intelligence services could be wrong.

""There is a history between weapons of mass destruction and intelligence which is problematic, to put it mildly,"" they said.

Asked why Corbyn did not explicitly condemn Russia in his response to the prime minister's Commons speech, they added: ""Clearly whoever carried out the attack is responsible for what was a completely heinous and reckless act.""

The spokesperson also suggested the poisoning might have been a carried out by a ""mafia"" or another former Soviet state, rather than orchestrated by the Kremlin.

""The break up of the Soviet state led to all sorts of material ending up in random hands,"" they said.

Prime Minister May said she was ""surprised and shocked"" by the Labour leader's statement and said most Labour MPs will be ""equally surprised"" by the spokesperson's comments.

A host of Labour MPs gave their full support to May's speech and suggested their leader should have been stronger in his condemnation of Russia.

Yvette Cooper said Russia ""must be met with unequivocal condemnation"" while Liz Kendall, John Woodcock and other Labour MPs echoed the prime minister's remarks.

Their Labour colleague Gavin Shuker MP tweeted:

Police and MI5 are probing allegations of Russian state involvement in up to 14 deaths in the UK in the wake of the nerve agent attack on a former spy.

Amber Rudd stressed that investigations and coroner’s inquests at the time “did not discover evidence of foul play” but the circumstances will now be looked at again.

“The Government was aware of allegations [of Russian state involvement], and takes seriously any suggestion that a foreign state has engaged in murder on UK soil,” she said in a letter to Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Committee.

“My immediate priority – and that of the police and other operational partners - is responding to the attempted murders in Salisbury, including decontamination, local reassurance and the criminal investigation itself. I do not want to distract from that focus.

“However, in the weeks to come, I will want to satisfy myself that the allegations are nothing more than that.”

Several MPs have raised the 14 deaths alleged to be suspicious by a Buzzfeed investigation published last year and demanded an inquiry.

They include the exiled oligarch Boris Berezovsky, whistle-blower Alexander Perepilichnyy, the “spy in the bag” Gareth Williams and a British scientist stabbed to death after being involved in the Alexander Litvinenko case.

No foul play was found in the deaths, and several were ruled to be suicide, but US intelligence agencies are said to view Mr Perepilichnyy’s death as an assassination.

Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium at a London hotel in 2006 (Reuters)

He had provided documents to prosecutors investigating alleged fraud by Russian officials and died while jogging in 2012.

Police said at the time they had found no evidence Mr Perepilichnyy’s was poisoned and the inquest into his death will resume next month.

Mr Berezovsky, a friend of Mr Litvinenko and vocal critic of Vladimir Putin, was found hanged in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in 2013.

Police said a post-mortem showed no sign of a violent struggle, and an inquest recorded an open verdict after hearing conflicting evidence.

Recommended The long history of Russian deaths under mysterious circumstances

Ms Cooper welcomed the Home Secretary’s decision to look at the cases and others where questions have been raised.

“Given the gravity of these issues, it is also right that the authorities should reassure us that they have looked at any further allegations or relevant evidence put forward in any other cases,” the Labour MPs added.

“The Government must satisfy itself that the correct finding was reached in each case and the public need to know that relevant questions about wider Russia links have been investigated and answered.”

She called for the Government to look to the UN Security Council for statements and resolutions over the attack on Mr Skripal and ensure “all states” cooperate with the criminal inquiry.

The Home Secretary said the committee will be informed of conclusions from the preliminary probe, which was made public after Theresa May named Russia as the likely culprit behind the attack in Salisbury.

The Prime Minister said a relatively new form of nerve agent called Novichok was used against former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.

She described the chemical weapon as “military-grade” and said it had been developed by Russia, adding: “The Government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act.”

Ms May said the Russian Government has a “record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations”, including against defectors like Mr Skripal who are viewed as legitimate targets.

“Either this was a direct act by the Russian State against our country, or the Russian government lost control of this potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others,” she told MPs on Monday.

Recommended Russia summons British ambassador over nerve agent attack allegations

“This attempted murder using a weapons-grade nerve agent in a British town was not just a crime against the Skripals.

“It was an indiscriminate and reckless act against the United Kingdom, putting the lives of innocent civilians at risk, and we will not tolerate such a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil.”

Lord Blair, who was Metropolitan Police Commissioner when Mr Litvinenko was assassinated in 2006, supported the call for a fresh inquiry into the historical deaths.

“They’re all quite different and some of them have some very conflicting evidence,” he told BBC Radio 4 on Friday.

“It’s not the police ‘shutting down’ things, there’s a lot of stuff between the police and Crown Prosecution Service - you’ve got to have evidence.”

Sergei Lavrov said Russia was not to blame for the attack (EPA)

The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Russia was “not to blame” for the attack in Salisbury and demanded access to samples of the nerve agent used.

Following a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee, Ms Rudd said the investigation involving “detailed and painstaking work” by more than 250 police officers was progressing well.

""My priority is this incident, the investigation itself, so we get the information as quickly as possible, and also the safety and security of the people in the community,” she added.

""The Russians have started responding. The Prime Minister has been very clear that they have until midnight tonight to satisfy her requests. Until then we will wait and see what they have put forward.

""I know that international allies have begun to rally their support and make comments publicly but at the moment what we are doing is awaiting the Russian response before stepping up and responding as the Prime Minister has said we will.”

France, Germany and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have given their backing to Britain's conclusion that Russia was behind the use of Novichok, and are believed to be discussing possible sanctions.

Mr Tillerson’s statement was released less than 24 hours before he was fired by Donald Trump, who said he made the decision to oust him “by myself” and that they had differing opinions on policy areas including Iran.

The President said he was due to speak to Ms May on the phone later, adding: “It sounds to me like they believe it is Russia and I would certainly take that finding as fact.

“As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with that, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.”

The Prime Minister is to chair a National Security Council meeting to discuss the Kremlin's response on Wednesday, and will then inform the House of Commons over any measures to be taken.

Ms May told the regular weekly meeting of Cabinet at 10 Downing Street that there was “no doubt of the severity of what had taken place in Salisbury, which was a reckless, indiscriminate and despicable act”.

Her official spokesperson said there was ""no requirement"" to provide nerve agent samples to Russia under an international convention on chemical weapons.

Mr Skripal and his daughter remain in a critical but stable condition in intensive care, while a police officer who was exposed while responding to the incident also remains in hospital in a serious condition.",neutral,1

FOR President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the timing of Turkey’s victory in the Afrin region of northern Syria could not have been better. After a two-month offensive against Kurdish militants, Turkish troops took control of the enclave’s main town on March 17th. The next day Turkey celebrated the anniversary of the battle of Gallipoli, the only big Ottoman victory of the first world war. True to form, Mr Erdogan rolled the two conflicts into one, accusing Western powers of backing the Kurdish forces against Turkey. “In Gallipoli they attacked us with the most powerful army,” he said. “Now that they do not have the courage to do so, they come at us with the world’s basest, bloodiest, specially trained and equipped terrorist organisations.”

Capturing Afrin was easier than expected. By the time Turkish tanks rolled into the main town, the Kurdish militia known as the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, had melted away. Nearly 200,000 residents had already fled, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Britain-based monitoring group says 289 civilians died over the course of Turkey’s offensive, along with more than 1,500 Kurdish fighters and 46 Turkish soldiers. America and Germany have condemned Turkey for adding to Syria’s misery. But Mr Erdogan dismisses their criticism. “We have not caused a single civilian to bleed from his nose,” he says.

Turkish officials say they now intend to bring the war against the Kurdish militants to Syria’s north-east and Iraq, where the YPG’s mother organisation, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), has bases. Turkey does not distinguish between the two groups. It has been fighting the PKK, which seeks self-rule in Turkey, for over three decades. But there is a big problem with Turkey’s plans. In the Syrian Kurds’ eastern strongholds, which stretch from Manbij to the Iraqi border (see map), they are flanked by as many as 2,000 American troops. The YPG, backed by America’s air force, has pushed the jihadists of Islamic State (IS) to the brink of defeat. Now Turkey wants America, its NATO ally, to get out of the way so that it can go after the YPG, considering it no less a threat than IS.",neutral,1
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sergei-skripal-nerve-agent-attack-russian-ex-spy-salisbury-england-theresa-may/,331,271,"SALISBURY, England -- British Prime Minister Theresa May was to meet Monday with her senior national security advisors to discuss the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury. Public health officials in England have warned about 500 people to take extra safety precautions after traces of a still-unnamed nerve agent were found at two separate locations in the city.

Sergei Skripal, the Russian who spied for Britain, and his 33-year old daughter Yulia remained in critical condition on Monday.

CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that forensics and decontamination work was still underway Monday at an Italian restaurant in Salisbury which Skripal and his daughter visited before collapsing on a bench nearby.

More military personnel in hazmat suits descended on the city over the weekend, removing potentially contaminated vehicles and cordoning off the graves of Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery.

Traces of the suspected nerve agent were found inside the Italian restaurant and a nearby pub, prompting a warning for customers who visited the establishments.

Sally Davies, the government's Chief Medical Officer for England, urged those patrons to ""wash clothing you haven't already, ideally in a washing machine. Any items which cannot be washed and would normally be dry-cleaned should be double-bagged in plastic until further information is available.""

A week after the suspected poisoning of Skripal and his daughter Yulia, some residents were left wondering why it took so long for officials to issue that kind of warning.

While investigators say they've identified the nerve agent used in the attack, they have not made that information public -- or named a possible suspect.

ln 2006, another Russian intelligence officer, Alexander Litvinenko, was murdered in Britain -- poisoned with radioactive polonium at an exclusive London hotel. British intelligence believe that was a Russian state-ordered execution.

At that time, Theresa May told Litvinenko's widow Marina that she would do anything to stop a similar incident from happening again.

""But unfortunately it happened again,"" Marina has said of the Skripal poisoning. ""It means something was not done and the lesson we received after the murder of my husband was not learned.""

There were unconfirmed reports in British media on Monday that Prime Minister May was close to pointing a finger at Russia for the attack on Skripal, but officially her government still insisted it was, ""important that we allow the police to get on with their work, that we gather all the evidence and if we get to a position when we are able to attribute this attack then we will do so and the Government will deliver an appropriate response.""

Meanwhile, in Russia -- where President Vladimir Putin's government has consistently denied links to either the Skripal case or the Litvinenko murder before it -- a Kremlin-friendly newscaster has suggested May's own government could have been behind the most recent attack. The motive? ""Russiaphobia,"" according to the news show.",neutral,1
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/14/russian-spy-poisoning-investigation-extends-dorset-town-sergei-skripal,369,302,"The investigation into the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia has widened further to take in a Dorset town and detectives have examined computer equipment of some of the former spy’s neighbours.

Residents of Gillingham, 30 miles west of Salisbury, were told to stay indoors while detectives and military personnel secured a vehicle connected to the attack. It is believed that the move is linked to Skripal’s BMW, one of the key focuses of the huge police operation.

Neighbours of Skripal, who lives on the outskirts of Salisbury, revealed that police have been examining their computer equipment.

Resident Chelsie Croes, 21, said: “They came to our house asking to check the wi-fi. The police wanted to check our internet routers. They didn’t say why they were doing it. I don’t know if they wanted to find out if we had been hacked into.”

As part of the inquiry - codenamed Operation Lime - officers have been going door to door asking people if they knew the Skripals and when they last saw them.

Quick Guide What is novichok? Show Novichok refers to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 80s to elude international restrictions on chemical weapons. Like other nerve agents, they are organophosphate compounds, but the chemicals used to make them, and their final structures, are considered classified in the UK, the US and other countries. The most potent of the novichok substances are considered to be more lethal than VX, the most deadly of the familiar nerve agents, which include sarin, tabun and soman. Novichok agents work in a similar way, by massively over-stimulating muscles and glands. Treatment for novichok exposure would be the same as for other nerve agents, namely with atropine, diazepam and potentially drugs called oximes. The chemical structures of novichok agents were made public in 2008 by Vil Mirzayanov, a former Russian scientist living in the US, but the structures have never been publicly confirmed. It is thought they can be made in different forms, including as a dust aerosol. The novichoks are known as binary agents because they only become lethal after mixing two otherwise harmless components. According to Mirzayanov, they are 10 to 100 times more toxic than conventional nerve agents. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images Europe Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

In Gillingham a street was sealed off early on Wednesday to allow the army to secure a breakdown truck. It is thought it may have been used to recover Skripal’s BMW. The truck belonging to Ashley Wood Recovery has been parked next to a bus stop in Gillingham for at least four days.

Residents living inside the cordoned area were told by police to remain in their homes during the operation or stay away for the whole day.

Stephanie Robertson, 24, said: “I was a bit worried. It’s right outside my house. I didn’t know if [the truck] was harmful or not. I was worried for my children. But I’ve been reassured by the police that it’s safe and we’re all OK.”

The BMW is one of five key possible crime scenes that the police appear to be focusing on. The others are Skripal’s home, the spot where he and his daughter fell ill, and the two places where the pair ate and drank before their collapse.

Police have launched a specific appeal for anyone who saw the Skripals in the BMW in the 45 minutes before they arrived in the Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury on the afternoon of Sunday 4 March, when they fell ill.

New footage from a CCTV camera that emerged on Wednesday captured the BMW passing the Devizes Inn a few minutes’ drive from his home at around 1.35pm on the Sunday.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the now-disbanded Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, said he believed the nerve agent used, novichok, was probably in powder form. “That seems to be the most plausible thing,” he said.

Theories have been swirling around Salisbury about how the novichok may have been delivered, including on the BMW’s door handles, steering wheel or in its ventilation system. But the Guardian understands that the police officer taken ill, DS Nick Bailey, may have fallen ill after visiting Skripal’s home, suggesting the house remains crucial.

De Bretton-Gordon said it was “plausible” that the nerve agent could have arrived in the post or in a gift. “You open a letter and the stuff goes all over the place,” he said.

“It is equally plausible that an agent could have delivered it. You only need to drop a small amount in someone’s pocket or brush past them.”",neutral,1
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/cold-war-un-secretary-general-antonio-guterres-syria-douma-gas-skripal-salisbury,378,305,"Relations between the west and Russia have deteriorated sharply amid concerns about a US-led military strike in the Middle East, prompting the United Nations secretary general to declare “the cold war is back with a vengeance”.

Adding to tensions on an extraordinary day of tit-for-tat exchanges, the UK published previously classified intelligence making fresh claims about the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, including that Russia had tested whether nerve agents could be applied to door handles.

Q&A What are the military options in Syria? Show In theory there are three alternative responses - the first a punitive strike such as the US attack on the Shayrat air base in April 2017 that saw 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles hit the the air base in response to a chemical weapons attack. The second level of attack is to seek to prevent Syria attempting to use chemical weapons again by destroying the relevant facilities, the means of delivery and imposing a punishment. The third level of activity is to seek to weaken the entire Assad military infrastructure or even attack Assad's presidential palace, as well as Syrian military headquarters. But there is no appetite in Western capitals to forcibly dislodge Assad from office, even if there may be an unspoken wish to change the way the Syrian government negotiates at UN peace talks in Geneva.

Military planners in the US, Britain and France, awaiting a final decision from their respective governments, are preparing plans for airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack by the Russian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad. Although anxious to avoid hitting Russian planes and military personnel based in Syria, the danger is of miscalculation and Russian retaliation.

António Guterres, seemingly alarmed by the speed of events, told an emergency meeting of the UN security council that the current volatility could have profound ramifications in the Middle East and beyond.

The UN secretary general suggested the danger was even greater than during the cold war because the safeguards that existed then to manage such a crisis “no longer seem to be present”. He added that there was no military solution to the Syrian conflict.

On a day of rapid developments that underscored the rationale behind Guterres’ comments:

The UK published previously classified intelligence claiming Russian military intelligence had targeted the email accounts of Sergei and Yulia Skripal since 2013 and had tested whether door handles could be used to deliver nerve agents. It said the highest concentration of the nerve agent found in Salisbury had been on the door handle.



The Russian ambassador to the UK said it would produce its own dossier setting out an alternative version of what had happened in Salisbury.



The Russian defence minister, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, claimed to have direct evidence that Britain had orchestrated the alleged chemical attack at Douma in Syria. The UK, he said, was “directly involved in the provocation”.

Although the US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said no decision has yet been taken on military action, the White House said it had “a high level of confidence” that the Syrian regime carried out the chemical weapon attack in Douma.

The US, UK and France continued to build up military resources in the eastern Mediterranean.

The fresh claims about the Salisbury attack were made in a letter from Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK’s national security adviser, to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. It is extremely rare for the UK to make such intelligence public.

The decision to go public was prompted by the UK coming off second best over the last few weeks in the war of words with Russia over responsibility for the attack. The surprise move by the intelligence agencies, who usually jealously guard their information, escalates tensions with Russia.

In his letter, Sedwill, who has an overview of the work of all the British spy services, said: “I know that Nato will remain seized of the need to confront the increasingly aggressive pattern of Russian behaviour of which the attack in Salisbury was an acute and recent example.”

His letter filled in some of the intelligence that Theresa May referred to when she made a House of Commons statement saying Russia was “highly likely to have been behind the attack.

In response, the Russian ambassador in London, Alexander Yakovenko, who seemed to be caught on the hop by the Sedwill letter, announced that the embassy would be publishing its own report on the attack.

“The British government still hasn’t produced any evidence in support of its position that would confirm their official version,” he told a press conference, at which he showed footage of Tony Blair apologising for intelligence mistakes made in the run-up to the Iraq war. “We get the impression the British government is deliberately pursuing the policy of destroying all possible evidence.”

In his Nato letter, Sedwill said the nerve agent novichok had been developed at the Russian research facility in Shikhany as part of an offensive chemical weapons programme with the codename Foliant.



Sedwill said Russia regarded at least some of its defectors as “legitimate targets for assassination”, with the suggestion that they could include Skripal, a former member of the GRU, Russian military intelligence, who was convicted by Russia of espionage in 2004 after working for MI6.



“We have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals, dating back at least as far as 2013, when email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists,” Sedwill wrote.

“During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents and to train personnel from special units in the use of these weapons. This programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents, including by application to door handles. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks under the same programme.”

He said Russia had continued developing small amounts of novichok over the past decade.

“Russia’s chemical weapons programme continued after the collapse of the Soviet Union,” he added. “By 1993, when Russia signed the chemical weapons convention (CWC), it is likely that some novichoks had passed acceptance testing, allowing their use by the Russian military.

“Russia’s CWC declaration failed to report any work on novichoks. Russia further developed some novichoks after ratifying the convention. In the mid-2000s, President [Vladimir] Putin was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme. It is highly unlikely that any former Soviet republic (other than Russia) pursued an offensive chemical weapons programme after independence. It is unlikely that novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (eg a criminal or terrorist group).”

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is linked to the United Nations, confirmed on Thursday that a novichok nerve agent had been used in the Salisbury attack.

Sedwill wrote: “I would like to share with you andallies further information regarding our assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the Salisbury attack. Only Russia has the technical means, operational experience and the motive.”

The failure of the UK to release intelligence had left a vacuum that Russia had filled with various alternative explanations and scenarios for the attack. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a British chemical weapons expert, said he was delighted some of the intelligence had finally been made public, expressing regret it had not been done earlier.

After Russia’s presidential election, during which the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observed “restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a lack of genuine competition” and an overall “coercive” election environment, Trump ignored the advice of key aides and congratulated Putin on his sham of an election win. Bristling at criticism of this decision, he wrote on Twitter: “I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing. They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts.” Obama and Clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!”

Trump’s apparent definition of strength involves delegating any statements that might generate conflict with Putin to underlings: While Trump stayed silent yesterday, Vice President Mike Pence, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert all made statements condemning the attack and explaining the U.S. expulsion and commitment to the transatlantic alliance.

As Trump attempts to beat back allegations of collusion with Russia dating back to the 2016 election, his silence is damning, but more worrisome is the effect his reticence has on policy. In this case, the United States and West as a whole are attempting to send an unequivocal message to Moscow: Using military-grade nerve agents brazenly in a sovereign state is unacceptable and in contravention to all international norms. It’s a message that comes with a high cost: Washington will almost certainly face the expulsion of more of its own diplomats in Russia, as well as the closure of another of its diplomatic properties.

Governments across Europe, the United States and elsewhere have announced plans to expel a total of more than 100 Russian diplomats in retaliation for the attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter on March 4. Moscow has denied being behind it.

Ireland cherishes its neutrality and is not part of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, but Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said it was not neutral when it came to such an attack and that it was important to show solidarity with its nearest neighbor.

“Ireland is a neutral country, we do not join military alliances. However when it comes to terrorism, assassinations, the use of chemical weapons and cyber terrorism, we are not neutral one bit,” Varadkar told parliament.

“We are joined of course in expelling diplomats with other countries that are neutral, including Finland and Sweden, who have taken the same course of action as us.”

Varadkar said the decision on whose diplomatic status was to be terminated was based on intelligence from police and defense forces. Ireland has expelled Russian diplomats before, most recently in 2011 in a row over the use of forged Irish passports.

Russia’s ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov, said its expelled diplomat had done nothing wrong or illegal and that the decision on appropriate, reciprocal action was now up to the Russian government.

“This kind of decision is unwarranted, uncalled for, senseless and regrettable. Clearly all responsibility for any effect of this move, on the otherwise positive state of Irish-Russian relations rests on the Irish government,” Filatov told a news conference at the Russian embassy in Dublin.

According to the Russian Embassies in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, the Ambassadors to these countries have been summoned earlier to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the respective nations.

Austria & Bulgaria Keep Channels Open for Dialogue

Austria will not expel Russian diplomats, as it intends to keep channels open for dialogue with Moscow, according to the cabinet spokesman. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that Austria would remain neutral and would work to restore relations between East and West.

""We will not take any measures at the national level, we will not expel diplomats. The reason for this is that we intend to keep open channels of dialogue with Russia. Austria is a neutral country and a kind of bridge between East and West. But we support the decision to recall the EU ambassador from Moscow,"" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Twitter.

""The use of a term ‘diplomat' [in the light of the issue of expulsion] is wrong. In fact, these are people who are called ‘unreported spies.' It seems that there are more of them in the Czech Republic than in any other country in Europe… Moreover, the Russian side has scandalously accused us, saying this Novichok poison is allegedly being manufactured here. This is a blatant lie,"" Andrej Babis wrote on his Facebook page.

But the three people who had the right to know most about Novichok, a nerve agent, were oblivious to its sudden appearance in headlines around the world – for they lay fighting for their lives in a British hospital.

Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, his daughter Yulia, 33, and police detective sergeant Nick Bailey, were all exposed to Novichok (or “newcomer”, to use its more parochial translation from Russian) in the English city on March 4. The circumstances surrounding the case are still being investigated – but the latest (unconfirmed and improbable) reports suggest that Skripal may have been exposed through the air vents of his BMW car.

You can listen to an audio version of this article on The Conversation’s In Depth Out Loud podcast.

Skripal was directly targeted, and perhaps his daughter was too, although it may simply have been Yulia’s proximity to her father that resulted in her exposure. Bailey was affected by the nerve agent as he was one of the first to respond and came into contact with it at a location as yet unknown. The police officer’s exposure is more likely to have been through contact with the nerve agent contaminating some surface.

At the time of writing, the Skripals remain in a critical condition in hospital. Bailey, meanwhile, is reportedly making a slow recovery and may be able to speak about his ordeal, perhaps providing vital clues. Environmental sampling will provide the evidence showing where the Skripals were most likely exposed and, hopefully, how that exposure occurred.

While the full facts have yet to come to light, the Novichok attack is developing into a full-blown international incident. The UK and Russia, which Britain has blamed for the attack, are now engaged in an increasingly bad-tempered tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats.

The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, even pointed the finger squarely at the Russian president, Vladimir Putin himself. Johnson said:

We think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK, on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the Second World War.

So how did we get here? And why do these lethal chemical agents exist at all?

The first nerve agents

The story stretches back to 1936, when the first nerve agent, named tabun (after the German word for “taboo”), was synthesised by talented German chemist Gerhard Schrader. Schrader was investigating organophosphate compounds for the Third Reich in an effort to find suitable insecticides to improve crop yields. He quickly discovered that tabun was too toxic to ever be used in farming as it would almost certainly kill those applying it. A year later, however, he developed a second, even more toxic nerve agent: sarin.

In debriefings by Allied intelligence officers after World War II, Schrader said that he’d been required to inform the Nazi authorities about his discoveries. But while Germany made munitions with both tabun and sarin, which were discovered at the end of the war, they were never used against Germany’s opponents.

Reasons for this are unclear. Some historians cite Hitler’s own exposure to chemical weapons during World War I and his apparent revulsion towards their use in battle. Others note Churchill’s warning to Hitler that any use by Germany of chemical or biological agents would be met with a swift response. But the most convincing reason is likely to be the one mooted by Schrader himself.

Schrader noted in his post-war debrief that other scientists around the world, including in Britain, were working on organophosphate chemicals and believed that they were almost certain to have also discovered nerve agents. So if Germany used them, other countries would use them on Germany. In fact, Schrader was wrong; only Germany had the chemicals.

Going global

After World War II, however, the UK, US and Soviet Union gained access to Nazi chemical know-how – and many German scientists began working for the victors. At the time, the prevailing view was that chemical weapons would almost certainly be used in a future conflict, and so the military usefulness of nerve agents such as tabun and sarin was investigated.

But tabun and sarin had their limitations. They were well suited for use on a rapidly moving battlefront because they vaporised and broke down in contact with water and so would disappear rapidly after use. But this left a gap in the arsenal, so-to-speak, for more persistent, longer-lived agents.

These were developed in the UK in the 1950s and include the now well-known VX. This was the nerve agent used in the 2017 assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in Kuala Lumpur airport.

Unlike sarin and tabun, VX-type agents, which have an oily texture and are very slow to evaporate, were considered to be what’s called area-denial chemicals. Any troops, or vehicles, moving through an area where VX had been used would have to be rigorously protected, compromising their manoeuvrability and fighting efficiency.

Nerve agents were evolving. But so too were the kinds of targets for chemical weapons. Increasingly, they were being used against civilians.

Who controls them?

About 20 different nerve agents have now been manufactured and all are listed, and restricted, under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. Novichoks are an exception because they have never been declared, more on which later.

In World War I, before the arrival of nerve agents, it was primarily troops who were affected by chemical weapons. During that conflict, some 1.5m military casualties were exposed to irritants such as chlorine and phosgene, or the blistering agent mustard gas – and around 8-10% of those affected, died. Meanwhile, around 1,000 civilians were injured by chemical weapons during that war.

Since World War I, however, chemical weapons have been used by Italy in Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) in 1935-6; by Japan in China during World War II; by Egypt in Yemen between 1963 and 1967; by Iraq in Iran (1983-1988) and Kurdistan (1988); and between 2013 and 2017 by the Syrian government against its own people. Sarin was also used in a 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, killing 13 and making thousands more ill. This is not a comprehensive list, but many of the victims of these attacks, particularly in Kurdistan and Syria, were civilians rather than troops.

Evidence of Iraq’s 1988 chemical attack on civilians in the Kurdistan town of Halabja, which included the use of sarin nerve agent, accelerated discussions already underway on a comprehensive chemical weapons treaty at the UN Council on Disarmament. In 1993, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was agreed. In 1997, the convention became international law following ratification of the treaty by 65 countries.

Today, 192 countries are fully paid-up members of the convention with only North Korea, Israel, South Sudan and Egypt still not part of the group. However, as the convention is international law, these four countries are still bound by its provisions that any use of a chemical to deliberately harm another person constitutes use of a chemical weapon – and is illegal.

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) oversees implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and supervises destruction of declared chemical weapons and any production facilities for these weapons. To date, approximately 96% of declared stockpiles have been destroyed. In October 2017, Russia announced that it had destroyed its stocks of some 40,000 tonnes. The US is expected to complete destruction of its weapons stockpile by around 2021-2022.

In addition to supervising the destruction of stockpiles, the OPCW operates a control regime for chemicals that are either chemical weapons or could be used to make them. Every year, each signatory to the convention is required to provide the OPCW with details on the location, manufacture, use, sale or disposal of these substances. The OPCW audits these returns and verifies them by random annual inspections of hundreds of military bases and chemical companies around the globe.

All manufacturing programmes which resulted in stocks of chemical weapons exceeding one tonne per year after January 1, 1946 must be declared to the OPCW. But on March 16, 2018, the OPCW announced that it had never been notified about Novichok-type nerve agents by any state.

So what is Novichok and what does it do to its victims?

Novichok family

There is no doubt that nerve agents similar to the Novichok family exist, something that has been described by defectors from Russia. One of these was used to poison the Skripals and Bailey.

Nerve agents, including certain Novichoks, are part of the family of organophosphate compounds – albeit at the most toxic end of the spectrum. They all operate in a similar way by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The enzyme can be found in various locations in the body, but it’s at the junctions between nerves and muscles where its activity is most critical. AChE regulates the message from nerve to muscle by inactivating the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

Acetylcholine binds to receptors at the neuromuscular junction, instructing the muscle to contract. The enzyme then removes this messenger, splits it in two, and with its removal from the receptor the muscle relaxes. This cycle is repeated as often as required by the demands on the muscles.

Inhibition of this removal and cleavage process sends all muscles into spasm and they no longer function normally. The effects are wide-ranging with the most critical being on lung and heart function. Respiratory paralysis is common in severe poisoning and the resulting lack of oxygen to critical organs, such as the heart and brain, can have serious consequences. If untreated, it may be fatal.

Exactly where, when and by whom these chemicals were made, however, and how and who used them against the Skripals remain unclear, triggering a major international crisis.

The UK is now exercising its rights under the CWC and has asked the OPCW to investigate Russia’s so-called Novichok programme. This is the first time one party to the CWC has accused another of attacking it with a chemical weapon. It will be a major challenge for the OPCW, which has been invited to send inspectors to the UK to collect samples for testing. The OPCW will use its own laboratory in Rijswijk, next to The Hague, and perhaps one of some 20 other designated facilities around the world to confirm the exact identity of the nerve agent.

Once it is confirmed, the OPCW will endeavour to find out more. However, it has never pointed the finger of blame at a user. Its remit is to confirm the use or identity of chemical agents and it can be called upon to carry out inspections in countries accused of using one. Others, such as the UN, will then assess the evidence and do the finger pointing. This is what happened when Syria was accused in 2017 of using chemical weapons against its own population.

The CWC does not preclude bilateral action by its signatories – and Britain and Russia have already begun expelling each other’s diplomats over the row. Russia has also closed the British Council and a UK consulate in St Petersburg.

On the ground

But what of the situation on the ground in Salisbury, where the Skripals were attacked? Nerve agents can poison somebody though inhalation, ingestion or skin contact which is why investigators in Salisbury are wearing full protective clothing and gas masks.

In fact, it is now the investigators, rather than the public, who face the risk of sustained exposure to any contamination. Some 130 people have so far been identified who may have been in contact with the agent but none beyond the Skripals and Bailey have shown any symptoms.

It was reported that the Skripals were essentially comatose when discovered and so were unable to say how they felt. But paramedics would likely have found the couple struggling to breathe. They may also have noticed twitching muscles, a glassy appearance to the eyes with pinpoint pupils and profuse salivation. In hospital, there may have been evidence of increasing fluid build-up in the lungs, and their heart rates may either have been rapid or slowed, and uneven.

Effects on the brain would be less evident as the couple were unconscious, but can include restlessness, headache, confusion and convulsions. A part of the brain is concerned with regulation of respiration and this may be affected directly, slowing breathing. A fall in blood pressure is also likely.

Possible treatments

Antidotes to reverse the clinical effects of nerve agents are available and are more likely to be successful if administered early. Around 200 cases of less severe accidental poisoning and four severe ones have been reported since 1948.

In all of the severe cases, the person poisoned lost consciousness and breathing was inhibited. But prompt treatment by doctors who were nearby and aware of the potential for exposure resulted in the victims’ full recovery.

In a quirk of fate, the UK’s own defence teams against chemical weapons are located at Porton Down, just outside Salisbury. Indeed, there have also been tests on hundreds of military servicemen with small doses of nerve agents and in 1953, after one poorly conducted test in the UK, a 20-year-old leading aircraftman, Ronald Maddison, died. The 2004 inquest into his death returned a verdict of unlawful killing. It’s also claimed that in the Novichok programme one person was accidentally exposed and died.

Treatment can include the rapid administration of atropine. This blocks the effects of acetylcholine accumulation by occupying the same receptors and reverses some symptoms, but has little effect on skeletal muscle. The rule of thumb is to maintain dosing of atropine (at intervals) until the heart rate is over 90 beats per minute. Administration may be necessary for a significant period.

Drugs known as oximes can also be used as an antidote. These restore enzyme activity and, crucially, skeletal muscle function. But oximes tend to be specific for certain types of nerve agent and it is unclear which would work with the specific Novichok agent as there is little information in the public domain about them or their effective treatments. Faced with this dilemma, the clinicians treating the Skripals and Bailey would have had to have made a choice.

A third drug used in nerve agent poisoning is diazepam, which can prevent any dangerous convulsions which might occur. Regrettably, however, evidence indicates that severe nerve agent poisoning can cause long-term irreversible changes in brain function.

Nerve agents are grotesque weapons and their use against civilians is a deeply disturbing trend. But in the weeks to come, there will have to be a dispassionate review of the evidence. And as the spat between Russia, and the UK and its allies worsens, cool heads will be needed.

Amid all this frenetic activity, however, we must not forget the three victims – and wish them a swift recovery. After all, they are the ones paying the heaviest price.

Yulia, 33, and Sergei Skripal, 66, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of spies to Britain's foreign intelligence service, were found unconscious on a public bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4.

With Britain accusing Russia of being behind the nerve agent attack, the affair has blown up into one of the biggest Russia-West crises since the Cold War.

Both were in a critical condition for weeks, and doctors at one point feared, even if they survived, they might have brain damage. But the Skripals' health since then has begun to improve rapidly.

Yulia has been discharged from Salisbury District Hospital, Christine Blanshard, medical director of the hospital, told reporters and her father could be discharged in due course.

U.K. hospital releases nerve-agent victim Yulia Skripal Duration 0:46 'This is not the end of her treatment, but marks a significant milestone,' says Dr. Christine Blanshard

""We have now discharged Yulia,"" Blanshard said. ""This is not the end of her treatment, but marks a significant milestone.

""Her father has also made good progress. On Friday, I announced he was no longer in a critical condition. Although he is recovering more slowly than Yulia, we hope that he too will be able to leave hospital in due course.""

Yulia has been taken to a secure location, the BBC said.

Trading accusations

Russia has denied Britain's charges of involvement in the first known offensive use of such a nerve agent on European soil since World War II, and suggested Britain carried out the attack itself to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.

Both Moscow and London have accused each other of trying to deceive the world with an array of claims, counter-claims and threats.

Blanshard, a doctor with 25 years of experience, said nerve agents work by attaching themselves to particular enzymes in the body that then stop the nerves from functioning. She said this had resulted in sickness and hallucinations.

Giving the first details about the medical treatment of the Skripals, Blanshard said doctors had first sought to stabilize them to ensure that they could breathe and that blood could circulate.

""We then needed to use a variety of different drugs to support the patients, until they could create more enzymes to replace those affected by the poisoning,"" she said. ""We also used specialized decontamination techniques to remove any residual toxins.""

Blanshard did not say when Yulia had been discharged, but the BBC said she had left hospital on Monday night and was now in a safe place.

Novichok poisoning

British Prime Minister Theresa May said the Skripals were poisoned with Novichok, a deadly group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.

Russia has said it does not have such nerve agents, and President Vladimir Putin said it was nonsense to think that Moscow would have poisoned Skripal and his daughter.

""We congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery,"" the Russian Embassy in London said. ""Yet we need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will.""

We congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery. Yet we need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will. —@RussianEmbassy

The embassy also said it would consider any secret resettlement of Sergei and Yulia Skripal as an abduction of its citizens. If the pair were secretly resettled, the opportunity to hear their version of events would be lost, it said.

The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War as allies in Europe and the United States sided with May's view that Moscow was either responsible or had lost control of the nerve agent.

But Moscow has hit back by expelling Western diplomats, questioning how Britain knows that Russia was responsible and offering its rival interpretations, including that it amounted to a plot by British secret services.

Sergei Skripal, who was recruited by Britain's MI6, was arrested for treason in Moscow in 2004. He ended up in Britain after being swapped in 2010 for Russian spies caught in the United States.

Since emerging from the John le Carre world of high espionage and betrayal, Skripal lived modestly in Salisbury and kept out of the spotlight until he was found poisoned.​​",neutral,1

The battle of narratives over the use of chemical weapons in Syria has been raging ferociously for years. But a chemical lab discovered in Eastern Ghouta this week is set to change the parameters of the discourse.

Last December, at a US military hangar near Washington DC, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley showcased an over-sized metal pipe as evidence of Iran’s military collusion with Yemen’s Houthi rebels. That picture hit every front page in the western hemisphere, drowning out the many objections that a big pipe on an American stage proves nothing.

This week, the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) liberated some Eastern Ghouta farmlands between Shifouniyeh and Douma and discovered a well-equipped chemical laboratory run by Saudi-backed Islamist terrorists. Not a single Western reporter showed up to investigate the facility.

The media disinterest is strange, given that US officials appear poised to green-light military attacks against Syria, which they claim has used chemical weapons (CW) against civilian populations. This charge remains unproven and highly contentious, with other parties arguing that anti-government militants are employing CW munitions to provoke a US military intervention against Syria.

So perhaps it’s not so strange that a chemical lab discovered right at the epicenter of a major strategic battle over Syria is being ignored by one side. In the end, it is likely that only one side is right about who is using CWs in Syria. Which is why one side went silent when this lab was revealed.

The chemical facility lies only a few dozen meters away from the current military frontline and was liberated as recently as Monday. The lab is surrounded by farmlands – the last place one would expect to find this stash. I see fields of wheat, green peas, beans and chickpeas scattered liberally in a conflict area Western media dubs a “starvation siege.” The building itself is shell-pocked and littered with debris, like so many of the structures I pass in Shifouniyeh and other towns in Eastern Ghouta where war rages.

But the sight inside is astounding. Upper rooms packed with electronic hardware, basements outfitted with large boilers, shelves filled with chemical substances, corners heaving with blue and black canisters (reportedly containing chlorine), chemistry charts, books, beakers, vials, test tubes and all the paraphernalia familiar to the average student of science. And then, in several corners, piles of pipe-shaped projectiles – clear munitions of some sort.

There’s one real standout in an upper room of the facility. It’s a newish looking piece of equipment with “Hill-Rom Medaes Medplus Air Plant” written on its front. A cursory Google search pulls up several interesting facts immediately – the machine is some kind of air or gas compressor, it’s a US-manufactured product, and Saudi Arabia put out tenders for this device in 2015.

A list of numbers and phone extensions taped to the wall confirms that this area – and the lab – was controlled by Jaysh al-Islam, a Saudi-backed terrorist group whose political figurehead Mohammad Alloush was once invited to head up the opposition delegation at UN-sponsored Geneva talks.

The Saudis have been caught out many times during this conflict for diverting equipment and weapons to the Syrian battlefield – purchases that were intended by the seller to be used only by a Saudi end-user. The Hill-Rom compressor, like most Western scientific equipment, would have been banned for sale to Syria under tight sanctions laws. Even if not created for military purposes, many such products are viewed by US officials as featuring “dual-use” technologies.

The Syrian officers on duty at the lab site could do little more than point out the obvious items of interest in the facility. They had only been there 24 hours and had not yet fully deciphered its intent. They had examined the blue and black canisters and discovered chlorine – a substance that has repeatedly been used in small quantities on the Syrian battlefield and has drawn widespread international censure.

Is this a chemical weapons lab? Or simply a chemical lab manufacturing a substance used in warfare – like explosives?

Even if no banned chemical munitions are found to be produced at this lab, its discovery is a game-changer in the chemical weapons blame-game. It is now indisputable that Western-backed and Gulf-financed Islamist militants have the capabilities to produce the chemicals of war inside the battlefield – and not in the makeshift way that media suggests. This lab demonstrates that militants can amass foreign-made equipment, create production lines and procure difficult-to-obtain components.

It can no longer be argued that militants lack the ability, connections and skill-sets to manufacture chemical munitions.

Terrorists and chemical weapons

There is ample evidence that terrorists have been using low-grade and unsophisticated CWs in the Iraqi and Syrian military theaters.

The use of the nerve agent Sarin in Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) by insurgents in Iraq has been documented by the media since 2004 – and in detail by the CIA, which links the substance to lost or pilfered stock from Iraq’s old chemical munitions program.

Chlorine IEDs were also first used in Iraq that same year, but it was in 2007 that an aggressive chemical war was launched in Anbar province and other parts of the country by Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which used chlorine bombs in suicide attacks.

Fast forward a decade or so. In 2016, the UK intelligence analysis firm IHS Conflict Monitor issued a report saying that Islamic State (which evolved out of Al-Qaeda in Iraq), has used chemical weapons, including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents, at least 52 times in both Syria and Iraq.

In Syria, the trouble began in December 2012 when the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front (a former IS ally), took over the country’s only chlorine manufacturing plant, a joint business venture with the Saudis located east of Aleppo. Damascus issued an immediate warning to the UN: “Terrorist groups may resort to using chemical weapons against the Syrian people… after having gained control of a toxic chlorine factory.”

Three months later, in what is viewed as the first real CW incident of the Syrian conflict, 26 people – the majority of them (16) Syrian soldiers – were killed in the village of Khan Assal in Aleppo in a reported chlorine attack. The next day, the Syrian government requested that the UN investigate the attack. A few days later, there was another alleged chemical incident in Adra, northeast of Damascus, followed by a reported attack in Saraqeb, and then in Ghouta in August – the CW incident that almost triggered US military strikes. A Jordanian reporter on the ground in Ghouta interviewed witnesses who said the Saudis had provided militants with chemical weapons and that some had been detonated by accident.

In May 2013, Turkish authorities captured 12 Nusra Front militants with 4.5lb of sarin gas. Turkish media carried varying reports about the terrorists’ goals – one of them was that the group was planning to take the materials back to Syria, Nusra’s home base.

In June, members of an Al-Qaeda cell were apprehended by Iraqi authorities who raided two Baghdad factories that were used to research and manufacture sarin and mustard agents. Authorities said that the AQ militants had precursor chemicals and formulas necessary for the production of the deadly CWs.

And so on and so forth. But back to the lab in Eastern Ghouta.

The lab’s occupants, Saudi-backed Jaysh al-Islam, publicly admitted in 2016 to using toxic agents in mortar attacks against Kurds in the Aleppo neighborhood of Sheikh Maqsood. “During the clashes one of the Jaysh al-Islam brigades used [weapons] forbidden in this kind of confrontations,” the group said in a statement about the chemical attack, in which it claimed the perpetrator would be held accountable.

The statement is relevant in only one way. It confirms the group has chemical munitions.

Who benefits from CWs?

In mid-2012, the Syrian government confirmed for the first time that it had chemical weapons, but stated these were only for use against “external aggression” and never against the Syrian people.

This statement could be viewed with the same skepticism as the one by Jaysh al-Islam, except for one thing: chemical weapons in no way, shape or form – neither politically nor militarily – benefit the Syrian government in this seven-year conflict. It’s why the Syrian government unilaterally admitted to its CW program and was so willing to relinquish it under US and Russian supervision.

The amount of CWs used on the Syrian battlefield is negligible in comparison with the scope and violence of the war. Why use a highly provocative weapon that kills only a few dozen people when you can use conventional munitions that can do a cleaner job?

And why risk the ire of the entire international community – and further isolation – when what you want most is to avoid foreign military intervention that can take out your military bases in mere days?

It’s telling that throughout Syria’s conflict, “massacres” and “chemical attacks” have taken place mostly when militants are facing setbacks or stalemates – or when important events like UN Security Council meetings loom.

What better opportunity to galvanize the international community to condemn, sanction, punish or bomb your enemy than with gruesome scenes of bodies convulsing and children gasping for air?

It really doesn’t matter what is found in the chemical lab at al-Shifouniyeh farms. The occupants of the lab, whether Al-Nusra, Jaysh al-Islam or IS – two of which are currently militarily active in Eastern Ghouta – have provided the last piece of the chemical weapons whodunnit puzzle. They always had the motive to stage chemical warfare in Syria, but now we can see they have the means and capabilities too.",neutral,1

Philip Hammond has refused a plea by the widow of murdered Alexander Litvinenko for the Tories to pay back more than £820,000 donated by Russian oligarchs, insisting the cash is legitimate.

The Chancellor also denied the Kremlin is “laughing at us” over Britain’s response to the killing and the suspicion that Russia was also involved in the poisoning of double agent Sergei Skripal.

Marina Litvinenko called for the return of the Russian cash – given since Theresa May became Prime Minister – saying: “You need to be very careful who you are friends with.”

But Mr Hammond insisted there were “very strict rules” surrounding donations, which could only come from British citizens and were “carefully vetted”.

“There are people in this country who are British citizens who are of Russian origin. I don’t think we should taint them, or should tar them with Putin’s brush,” he said.

Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Ms Litvinenko said the Prime Minister had broken her pledge – in a personal letter she brandished – to do everything to prevent a repeat of her husband’s murder.

But the Chancellor insisted: “Nobody is laughing at us. This is a very serious investigation that is going on, let’s see where it leads us.”

✕ Tory MP Tom Tugendhat: England fans at World Cup in Russia may be targeted as a result of reprisals for Skripal

It was reported that Russian oligarchs and their associates have registered donations of more than £820,000 to the Tories since the summer of 2016.

Ms May promised to distance her party from Russian donors when she took office, her allies briefing that she would “sup with a long spoon” and reject a “business-as-usual” relationship with Moscow.

The Tories have received more than £3m from Russian billionaires and lobbyists for Moscow since their return to government in 2010.

And one of the most controversial donors paid the party more in a year under Ms May than in six years under David Cameron, the paper reported.

Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Putin minister, handed the party £253,950 in the year to September 2017, Electoral Commission figures show, and bid £30,000 to have dinner with Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary.

In her interview, Ms Litvinenko warned the lesson “was not learned”, more than a decade after her husband, an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin, was fatally poisoned.

A public inquiry concluded in 2016 that the killing of the Russian dissident had “probably” been carried out with the approval of the Russian president.

Ms Litvinenko was speaking as Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia remain in hospital following the suspected nerve agent attack in Salisbury a week ago.

Detectives have yet to identify who was responsible, but Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson triggered a diplomatic row by pointing the figure at the Kremlin - something rejected by the Russian Embassy.

Ms Litvinenko showed a letter, sent to her by Ms May, when Home Secretary, promising to “continue to pursue justice” over the murder, to ensure no repeat.

This was ""business as usual,"" but there was more. Stoltenberg dedicated nearly half the time of his press conference and the question time to the issue of poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom. For him, there is no question that Russia is behind this poisoning with military-grade nerve agent. Stoltenberg noted that it was the first time such a weapon was used on the Alliance territory since NATO’s foundation.

Skripal and his daughter were found unconscious in Salisbury on March 4. They are currently being treated for exposure to a chemical substance, a military-grade nerve agent, according to UK experts.

Skripal Case

UK Prime Minister Theresa May condemned Russia in three sentences, without allowing Moscow to defend itself, and for Stoltenberg, there is no doubt, either, that Russia is to blame.

""The attack in Salisbury has taken place against the backdrop of a reckless pattern of Russian behaviour. Over many years. The illegal annexation of Crimea and military support to separatists in Eastern Ukraine. The military presence in Moldova and Georgia against these countries’ will. Meddling in Montenegro and elsewhere in the Western Balkans. Attempts to subvert democratic elections and institutions. And the military build-up from the North of Europe to the Middle East,"" Stoltenberg said.

Russian officials have rejected these claims, made time and again, repeatedly stressing that Russia does not interfere in other states' affairs and pointing out that the accusations are put forward without any evidence to support them.

Moscow has denied the allegations of involvement in this incident and offered its help in investigation. However, its request to be given access to the suspicious substance was denied.

Asked what NATO could do to support the United Kingdom, presented as a victim of Russian aggression, Stoltenberg said that London ""is not alone and NATO is ready to help, but no request has reached us yet for the investigation,"" without specifying precisely how NATO could help.

The secretary general then mentioned again the increased presence of NATO navies in the Black Sea, the four battle groups amassed by NATO on its Eastern borders, facing Russia, and the investment in cyberdefense. Aggressive talk, indeed, from NATO: more so than at any time in the recent past.

Back to USSR?

During the press conference, Stoltenberg mentioned that the poisonous substance, Novichok, was developed by Russia, although it was created more than 30 years ago in the Soviet Union.

It is unclear if the confusion between Russia and the Soviet Union was intentional, but the conflation is alarming, especially as it comes from the head of the Alliance. Moreover, the nerve agent could be recreated elsewhere. Nevertheless, it was implied that Russia's culpability was evident.

Of course, at the end of his speech, Stoltenberg paid lip service to peace: ""NATO’s approach remains firm, defensive, and proportionate.

Britain, the US, Germany, and France issued a joint response to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and Yulia Skripal on Thursday afternoon, condemning Russia for the ""first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War"".

But on Thursday morning and through Wednesday France had initially appeared more hesitant to line up behind Theresa May’s version of events, with Emmanuel Macron’s government taking a more careful approach.

On Wednesday Benjamin Griveaux, a spokesperson for the country’s government, said it was too early to decide on retaliatory measures against Russia, as its involvement was yet to be proven.

“We don't do fantasy politics. Once the elements are proven, then the time will come for decisions to be made,” he told a press conference shortly after Theresa May announced she would be expelling Russian diplomats over the poisoning.

The response apparently raised eyebrows in Westminster and elsewhere, where Theresa May’s analysis and approach has received stronger support. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former Nato chief, told the BBC that “anything short of full solidarity with the UK will be considered a victory by the Kremlin”.

The French government then put out another statement, this time as an “Elysee source”, which said: “France's solidarity with the UK is unquestionable.

“President Macron denounced as early as Tuesday the Salisbury chemical attack as unacceptable and assured Prime Minister May the UK had France's full support. Both leaders will discuss the matter yet again this Thursday.

“Since the beginning of this week, the UK has briefed its allies thoroughly, and France in particular, that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack.”

Saying you’ve been told something was highly likely, is of course, not the same as saying you believe it is true.

The French statement also contrasted with what the White House was saying at the time, with an unequivocal condemnation of what it said was Russian involvement: “The United States shares the United Kingdom’s assessment that Russia is responsible for the reckless nerve agent attack on a British citizen and his daughter,” a spokesperson said.

Donald Trump's administration is widely regarded as being close to Russia, so why were they ahead of France in condemning the attack? Key to understanding the different French response is the strategy taken by Emmanuel Macron to Russia and Vladimir Putin and the background to the two leaders’ relationship.

Mr Macron has always been keen not to isolate Russia on the international stage. He is making his first presidential trip to Russia in May, and has engaged directly with Mr Putin over Syria in a way that some other Western leaders have not, asking the president to help open humanitarian corridors and mooting the return of peace talks.

Last month the two leaders had a comprehensive discussion over the telephone in which they pledged to cooperate more closely, including on Syria. They have also tried to put the Ukraine conflict behind them. Mr Putin visited France in May of last year.

Diplomatically, preventing a leader from becoming isolated is a fairly standard approach to preventing the escalation of a conflict. But there are also increasingly important economic ties between the two countries, too.

Russian state media outlet RT reported earlier this month that trade between the two countries is booming, having risen by around a fifth in 2017 despite sanctions. France buys minerals from Russia, while Russia buys chemicals, machinery, and food from France.

Russian ambassadors are also keen to note that French investment in the Russian economy is growing, having reached more than $14 billion, while Russia's direct investment in France is $3.2 billion, according to figures put out on RT.

More straightforwardly, French scepticism of the claims of British intelligence is nothing new, as anyone who remembers the run-up to the Iraq war will know. But for France, the stakes of alienating Russia are simply higher.

Britain’s economic relationship with the country mostly involves Russian big money coming to London, a relationship that doesn’t seem likely to be endangered by anything Theresa May says about Vladimir Putin. This is arguably not the case for France, explaining its initial caution – even if after international pressure, it lined up behind its allies.

When used as an aerosol (the most common method of application), BZ is absorbed through the respiratory system; it can also be absorbed through the skin or digestive system. It takes about one hour for the agent to begin to take effect, with peak effect reached after 8-10 hours.

According to the Handbook of Toxicology and Chemical Warfare (2015), less than one milligram of BZ administered orally results in incapacitation for several days. Symptoms of exposure to the drug include delirium, tremors, stupor, hallucinations, ""and coma that can last for more than 2 days."" Other symptoms include paranoia and mania.

Tested By (and On) US Troops

After finding out about the chemical's existence, the US Army began testing 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate on its troops. Maryland's Edgewood Arsenal experimented with BZ, along with LSD, THC, ketamine, opioids and other drugs on hundreds of military personnel and civilians into the mid-1970s. Originally designated 'TK', the chemical agent received the NATO designation BZ in 1961.

Weaponized in 1962

The US Army Chemical Corps weaponized BZ in 1962, mass producing the agent and packing it into the M44 smoke generator cluster and M43 BZ cluster bombs for use against squad or company-sized enemy forces.

The dark-haired woman was spotted wearing a black face mask as she left a Pret a Manger, a three-minute walk from where Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were later found convulsing and vomiting.

At the time the pair were thought to be in the Mill pub a few yards away.

Anti-terror police also took over a Sainsbury's car park in Salisbury as part of the rapidly expanding chemical attack probe

The investigation into the poisoning has led to a series of locations around Salisbury being sealed off and decontaminated

Yesterday chemical warfare experts locked down a nearby village amid fears that Mr Skripal’s car could contain traces of the nerve agent that has left him fighting for his life.

Army and police vehicles and ambulances rolled into West Winterslow just after lunchtime before investigators in hazardous material suits and gas masks loaded a white transit van on to a flatbed truck. The van’s driver was also asked to hand over his clothes, it was claimed.

The masked woman spotted on Sunday had been carrying a large bag, according to Mark Francis, a car dealer, who reported the incident to police on Wednesday.

Mr Francis said the mask could have been used to protect the identity of an assassin.

Counter-terror police have not yet released images of any potential suspects despite claims the centre of the city is covered by a new high-definition CCTV system.

Mr Francis said he initially thought nothing of the black mask, which is of the type that became a familiar sight after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) in 2002.

But after it was revealed that nerve agents were used in the assassination attempt, he reported what he had seen.

Mr Francis, 50, said: ‘We were in the town centre in Pret a Manger. We were in there at 3.35pm and I was sitting by the door and this lady walked out at 3.40pm.

‘She was wearing a Sars mask, a black Sars mask tucked around her chin and a bag in her hand.

‘It was really odd as you don’t often see someone wearing a Sars mask in Salisbury. We don’t get smog or pollution. When it became a chemical attack it sounded more likely that it could be significant.

‘She had dark hair, a single woman, but I didn’t think she was obviously Asian.’

On Sunday it was reported that a witness told police that an hour before the couple collapsed he saw a ‘man in a mask’ with his hood up acting suspiciously nearby.

The witness said: ‘He looked threatening and aggressive and he was walking towards us with purpose. He gave me a stern look as he passed us by about 100 yards from the bench where they found the Russians.’

The white transit van which was taken from West Winterslow, five miles from the centre of Salisbury, is thought to have been used to tow away Mr Skripal’s BMW – and could also contain traces of the deadly toxin. The van was parked outside the home of Robert Horner, 22 who neighbours said works for Ashley Wood Recovery.

Mr Horner is also believed to have handed over his clothes to investigators. Neighbour Robbie Williams, 54, said: ‘They took all the guy’s clothes.’

Five specialists in breathing apparatus removed the van in a painstaking operation taking more than five hours. Earlier, counter-terrorism police including one wearing a balaclava cordoned off the top floor of a Sainsbury’s car park in Salisbury where it was believed Mr Skripal had parked his BMW before eating at a Zizzi restaurant on Sunday with his daughter.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/22/salisbury-attack-medical-staff-contacted-police-when-antidotes-failed-to-work,1047,745,"A judge has given doctors permission to take blood samples from the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, so that tests can be carried out by chemical weapons experts.

Mr Justice Williams made the ruling after a hearing in the court of protection, where issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions are considered.

The Skripals are both in a coma in hospital after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury and therefore unable to give their consent to blood samples being taken or tested.



The judge, David Williams, who is based in the family division of the high court in London, announced his decision on Thursday after analysing the case at a private hearing earlier this week.



Giving his ruling, the judge said the Skripals remain in hospital under heavy sedation, are unable to communicate and that it was not possible to say when or to what extent either may regain mental capacity.

“The precise effect of their exposure on their long-term health remains unclear, albeit medical tests indicate that their mental capacity might be compromised to an unknown and so far unascertained degree,” the judge said in his ruling.The ruling came as it emerged that police in Salisbury realised they were dealing with a possible terrorism attack within hours of Sergei and Yulia Skripal becoming ill when the pair failed to respond to antidotes.



Wiltshire police got in contact with the counter-terrorism network on the night of the attempted murder, the force’s chief constable, Kier Pritchard, said on Thursday.

Pritchard also said DS Nick Bailey, the police officer exposed to the novichok nerve agent when responding to the attack, has been discharged from hospital.

He said the recovery process following the nerve agent attack would be prolonged. Careful decontamination would be needed before some areas of the city can be returned to the public.

Pritchard explained that initially police believed they were responding to a medical emergency when Skripal, 66, and Yulia, 33, were found ill on a bench in Salisbury on Sunday 4 March.

When it was realised on Sunday night that the antidotes that medical staff were using were not working, the force contacted the counter-terrorism network and on Monday morning a major incident was declared, he said.

Speaking to the Wiltshire police and crime panel at the Corn Exchange in Devizes, 25 miles north of Salisbury, Pritchard said the operation was still focused on gathering evidence and had not yet entered the recovery stage.

He said 80 police officers were guarding cordoned-off areas to ensure evidence could be gathered. Once this had been done, decontamination would take place so the cordoned-off areas were “fit to return to the public”. He added: “It may take days, weeks, who knows? … It will be a fairly slow inquiry.”

He continued: “Our role is to ensure we return the community, Salisbury, the UK, back to normality.”

Pritchard accepted that concerns had been raised by members of the public about the nature of the nerve agent and the possible long-term impact on the environment. He told the panel that footfall in some parts of Salisbury and takings in some shops were down by 90%.

He said he had met the bishop of Salisbury, the Right Rev Nicholas Holtam, who had expressed concern. Visitor numbers at Salisbury Cathedral are down this month by more than a third compared with the same time last year.

Jane Morgan, the cathedral’s director of communications and development, said: “These are provisional figures and cover the periods of disruption due to snow and ice, as well as the recent incident.

“The downturn hasn’t taken us by surprise. Similar falls have been seen by colleagues at cathedrals in London when there have been major incidents there. The message that we do need to get out there is that while a small part of the city has been affected, the city centre and the cathedral, which is at some distance from the sites under investigation, are both functioning normally.”

The bishop added: “Salisbury is an 800-year-old cathedral city, gathered around one of Europe’s greatest buildings, which exists to celebrate the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. That life shows us that hatred and destruction do not have the last word. Love and life do.

The Russian embassy to the UK has congratulated Yulia Skripal on her recovery from a nerve agent attack that Britain and an array of Western allies blamed on Russia.

Yulia Skripal, 33, was released from hospital on Tuesday after she and her father, a former Russian double agent, were poisoned in Salisbury in southern England last month.

In a message posted on Twitter, the Russian embassy stressed the need for “urgent proof that what is being done to her [Yulia] is done on her own free will”.

We congratulate Yulia Skripal on her recovery. Yet we need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will. — Russian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) April 10, 2018

Doctor Christine Blanshard of Salisbury District Hospital said Yulia Skripal left the premises late on Monday after responding “exceptionally well” to treatment, adding that her father had made a slower recovery but would be discharged “in due course”.

Skripal herself issued a statement last Thursday in which she said her strength was “growing daily”.

“I am grateful for the interest in me and for the many messages of goodwill that I have received,” she said.

Sergei Skripal and his daughter were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury on March 4 following exposure to Novichok, a nerve agent.

Britain has maintained that Russia was responsible for the attack – an allegation Russia has denied.

At a UN Security Council meeting last Thursday, Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, said Britain was “playing with fire” by blaming Moscow for the poisoning.

Many Western countries have sided with the UK by expelling Russian diplomats, prompting Russia to respond by also expelling several diplomats and their families.

Last week, a Russian proposal for a joint investigation into the poisoning was rejected in a vote at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) collected independent samples at Britain's request. As the findings were released on Thursday, Foreign Secretary Johnson simultaneously declared, again, that Russia was behind the chemical attack in Salisbury on former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.

Johnson said that the chemical used in the Salisbury attack was a military-grade nerve agent – Novichok – and that there can be “no doubt“ that Russia was responsible.

""There remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible – only Russia has the means, motive and record,” Johnson said, despite the report from the OPCW offering no new findings beyond what Britain’s own lab has already found.

The foreign secretary’s renewed claims that Russia is responsible for the Salisbury attack come after he told a German TV channel that he had been informed by British military lab Porton Down that without a doubt the poison had originated from Russia.

Days later, Porton Down chief Gary Aitkenhead undermined Johnson’s comments, telling Sky News that the facility was unable to determine the origin of the toxin.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May said on March 12 that Sergei and Yulia Skripal had been poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent from the Novichok group of poisons, which sparked international tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions and tension with Moscow. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack on the ex-Russian double agent and his daughter.

On Thursday, the OPCW’s executive summary of its independent findings was made public.

“The results of analysis by the OPCW designated laboratories of environmental and biomedical samples collected by the OPCW team confirm the findings of the United Kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical that was used in Salisbury and severely injured three people,” the public report reads.

“The name and structure of the identified toxic chemical are contained in the full classified report of the Secretariat, available to States Parties.”

Russia has consistently denied any involvement in the poisoning. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Britain would have to apologize to Russia for its “mad accusations.”

The chemical weapons agency will hold a special session on the Salisbury poisoning next Wednesday to further discuss the findings.

Yulia and her father Sergei, a former double agent, fell victim to an apparent nerve-agent attack four weeks ago in Salisbury. London claims the toxin was a Soviet military-grade chemical weapon and holds the Kremlin responsible. Despite being exposed to the lethal poison, Yulia is currently recovering and may be allowed to receive a visit from Russian diplomatic staff.

“We are considering requests for consular access in line with our obligations under international and domestic law, including the rights and wishes of Yulia Skripal,” a spokeswoman for Britain's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.

The 33-year-old woman has Russian citizenship, which makes any alleged crime targeting her a matter of interest for the Russian government. She is entitled to various forms of assistance from the Russian embassy in the UK, should she require it.

Moscow has repeatedly criticized London for failing to properly notify Russia of the circumstances surrounding the poisoning, and for stonewalling requests to share that data. Russia denies any involvement in the poisoning and says the UK is violating its own obligations under the Organization for the Prohibition of the Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which sets out rules dictating how suspected incidents of chemical-weapons use must be investigated.

There is a strong suspicion in Moscow that the poisoning was a foreign intelligence operation and Britain’s reluctance to share information on it points to its possible complicity, Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry said in an interview on Saturday.

“We still have no information about this case. The only official report we received from Britain came yesterday and it was about Yulia Skripal’s improving health. It would have being a long shot to accuse Britain or any British officials of direct involvement in this story, but there are suspicions,” she said.

The ministry also handed a note of protest to the UK envoy over London’s “provocative actions.” The tit-for-tat measures by Moscow come amid a whirlwind campaign launched by London over the poisoning of Russian ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury earlier in March.

Top UK officials, including Prime Minister Theresa May and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, promptly pinned the blame on Moscow, claiming that a military-grade nerve agent called A-234 (also known as ‘Novichok’) was used in the incident.

On Friday, the Russian FM summoned the heads of diplomatic missions from countries that had either already expelled or decided to expel Russian diplomats “in solidarity” with the UK over the Skripal case. All of them were handed notes of protest.

Among those summoned was UK envoy to Russia Laurie Bristow. He was told that within one month, the British side must cut its diplomatic staff in the embassy and its consulates across Russia to the same size as the Russian diplomatic mission in the UK. No exact numbers were provided to the public.

Moscow also expelled two Italian diplomats and gave them a week to leave the country, the Italian Foreign Ministry confirmed in a statement. The list included a number of Swedish, Finnish and Polish diplomats as well. They were given several days to leave the country.

Last week, London ordered 23 Russian diplomats to leave the UK as part of sanctions imposed by Theresa May. The family members of the expelled staffers were also forced to leave Britain.

Judging by what London has offered as proof so far, the allegations are merely an assumption, according to the Russian side, which has denied any involvement. UK law enforcement officials say that the probe is still ongoing and officers are likely to continue work in Salisbury “for several weeks and months.”

However, London’s blame game has not garnered full support. Austria said it won’t be joining the punitive measures against Russia. “Indeed, we want to keep the channels of communication to Russia open,” Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl said.

Czech President Milos Zeman called the London claims “a bit superfluous,” and demanded the UK deliver proof of its allegations that Russia had a hand in the Skripal poisoning.

“Fishwife’s rhetoric demonstrated today by the head of the British Defense Ministry Gavin Williamson, perfectly characterizes an extreme degree of his intellectual impotence,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement.

The Russian side hit back at Williamson after his Thursday comments, when he said that the country “should go away and shut up.” That was the Defence Secretary’s reaction to the question about possible countermeasures by Moscow in response to the British sanctions over the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in early March.

The vocabulary employed by the UK defense secretary “only confirms the vanity of all of London’s accusations against Russia… but also the total pettiness of the ‘accusers’ themselves,” the MoD pointed out.

A “cozy home” of “fake sensations,” that’s how the ministry called the UK, referring to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the White Helmets. “Therefore we’ve developed a strong immunity to London’s fake accusations of Russia.”

“As for the boorish expressions by the UK Defense Secretary regarding Russia, in the absence of actual results of his official activities, apparently, they alone remain in the arsenal of Her Majesty's Armed Forces,” the MoD said.

Earlier, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Williamson’s outburst showed that British authorities were nervous and had “something to hide.”

“What could he say, the defense minister of a country that conceals information on the use of chemical-warfare agents on its soil?” she wrote on Facebook, refereeing to London’s refusal to provide evidence in the Skripal case to Moscow.

Williamson’s remarks were also ridiculed online by many in the UK who expressed their concerns over the British Armed Forces being headed by “a pre-pubescent schoolboy” who comes up with threats one would be “more likely to hear on the playground.”

Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in critical but stable condition after being discovered slumped on a bench in Salisbury in early March. Authorities in the UK claim a Soviet-era nerve agent called Novichok was used in the attack on the former Russian-UK double agent. Russia denied any involvement in the incident.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May rushed to accuse Russia of using a chemical weapon on British soil and confronted Moscow with an ultimatum to reveal the details of the Skripal plot. The demand was rejected and, on Wednesday, the UK imposed sanctions on Moscow, which included the expulsion of 23 diplomats, limiting ties and freezing Russian state assets in the UK.

Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, said that UK diplomats will “definitely” be expelled from the country in response to the move by London. However, Moscow stressed that it was open to cooperation with the UK on the Skripal case if it is treated as an equal partner in the probe.

In late 2014, a Ukrainian army aircraft mechanic told Russian media that the passenger airliner may have been downed by a Su-25 close air support aircraft flown by Voloshin. The Ukrainian side confirmed that the pilot was in the military at the time, but denied that he flew on the day the Malaysian airliner was brought down.

Speaking to Sputnik about Voloshin's suspected suicide, Ukrainian politics expert Bogdan Bezpalko said that Kiev's version aside, ""one cannot help but think that the other side may have eliminated him as a dangerous witness who could have lifted the veil of secrecy over the downing of MH17, which would subsequently strengthen Russia's position."" According to the political scientist, ""it's quite obvious that it was not in Russia's interest to shoot down this plane, and that all this was a provocation directed against our country.""

In Bezpalko's view, Kiev and its Western power will continue to do everything they can to see that the truth about the tragedy of flight MH17 does not surface anytime soon. ""It's possible that others who could shed light on this matter will be 'silenced' in one way or another. So I don't think we will learn the truth any time soon.

accused the british government of pressuring the perpetrators to speed up the provocation during a briefing on friday the ministry showed interviews with two people who it said are medical professionals working in the only hospital operating in douma a town near the syrian capital damascus in the interviews released to the media the two men reported how footage was shot of people dousing each other with water and treating children which was claimed to show the aftermath of the april chemical weapons attack the patients shown in the video suffered from smoke poisoning and the water was poured on them by their relatives after a false claim that chemical weapons were used the ministry said please notice these people do not hide their names these are not some faceless claims on the social media by anonymous activists they took part in taking that footage said ministry spokesman majorgeneral igor konashenkov the russian defense ministry also has evidence that britain had a direct involvement in arranging this provocation in eastern ghouta the general added referring to the neighborhood of which douma is part we know for certain that between april and april the socalled white helmets were seriously pressured from london to speed up the provocation that they were preparing according to konashenkov the group which was a primary source of photos and footage of the purported chemical attack was informed of a largescale artillery attack on damascus planned by the islamist group army of islam which controlled douma at the time the white helmets were ordered to arrange the provocation after retaliatory strikes by the syrian government forces which the shelling was certain to lead to he said the uk rejected the accusations with british un ambassador karen pierce calling them grotesque a blatant lie and the worst piece of fake news weve yet seen from the russian propaganda machine one of the interviews published by the ministry showed a man who said his name was halil ajij and who said he was a medical student working at doumas only operational hospital this is how he described the origin of the footage on april a bomb hit a building the upper floors were damaged and a fire broke at the lower floors victims of that bombing were brought to us people from the upper floors had smoke poisoning we treated them based on their suffocation ajij said that a man unknown to him came and said there was a chemical attack and panic ensued relatives of the victims started dousing each other with water other people who didnt seem to have medical training started administering antiasthma medicine to children we didnt see any patient with symptoms of a chemical weapons poisoning he said the first photos claiming to show the aftermath of the alleged chemical attack on april were published online on the same day and featured the bodies of many people including children some with foam around their mouths and noses footage from the hospital was released on sunday with the sources behind it claiming that it had been shot on saturday konashenkov said russia hoped that international monitors from the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw which is due to investigate the circumstances of the incident will help establish the truth he added eastern ghouta is currently trying to return to peaceful life after being liberated from militant groups by syrian government forces he called on other nations and international organizations to provide humanitarian aid which is badly needed in the area russia is already supplying food medicine building materials and other essential supplies to the neighborhood he said residents of the neighborhood who previously fled violence are returning to their homes now that the area is relatively safe the russian official said the latest reports from the ground say about people have returned which is over half of the displaced residents he added the reported chemical weapons attack escalated tensions over syria just as damascus was about to seize full control of eastern ghouta the us and allies such as the uk and france threatened military action in response to what they claim is an atrocity committed by the syrian government russia insists the incident was staged and said it reserves the right to counter any attack on syria rt spoke about the russian claims with lord alan west a retired officer of the british royal navy he said he had strong reservations about taking allegations against damascus at face value because it didnt make much military sense it seems to be utterly ludicrous for the military that is in the process of taking over an area to go and do something with chemical weapons which will draw the wrath of the larger enemy down upon them he said if i

https://www.rt.com/news/424537-russia-opcw-uk-skripal-lies/,245,204,the uks narrative in the skripal case is a story woven with lies with london continuously trying to deceive the international community russias opcw envoy said highlighting eight examples of such misinformation weve tried to show that everything our british colleagues produce is a story woven with lies russias permanent representative to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw aleksandr shulgin told reporters on wednesday following the organizations meeting on the skripal case and unlike the british who arent used to taking responsibility for their words and unfounded accusations we showed specific facts why we believe our british partners to put it mildly are deceiving everyone the official provided eight examples of ukpushed misinformation surrounding the march events when the former double agent sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were poisoned in the town of salisbury russia refuses to answer uk questions in reality theyve asked us only two questions and both were worded in such way that the existence of an undocumented arsenal of chemical weaponry at russias disposal was presented as an established fact beyond any doubt it was effectively an ultimatum pressing moscow to either confess that it attacked the uk with chemical weapons or to admit that it had lost control over the chemical warfare arsenal moscow answered both of these questions immediately stating that it had nothing to do with the salisbury incident apart from that the official emphasized it is an established fact that russia destroyed all its chemical weaponry stockpile ahead of schedule last year uk abides by chemical weapons convention rulebook the opcw procedures clearly state that if one member state has issues with another it should send an official request and thus the other party would be obliged to respond within days shulgin said however instead the uk allegedly instigated by their colleagues from across the pond disregarded the established mechanism and came up with a dubious independent verification scheme which violates those very opcw rules russia refuses to cooperate while the uk and a number of its allies accuse russia of refusing to cooperate to establish the truth the situation is exactly the opposite shulgin insists moscow is interested in a thorough investigation of the incident especially since the victims are russian citizens moscow repeatedly insisted on a joint probe and urged london to release data on the skripal case but all efforts were in vain many requests went unanswered by the uk while others received only a formal reply russia invents versions to distract attention despite numerous speculations and allegations by questionable sources cited by the uks own domestic media it was moscow that was eventually accused of coming up with some versions of the salisbury events allegedly to disrupt the investigation shulgin said in reality the picture is different in fact its the british tabloids the socalled independent media which is multiplying those versions the official stated recalling some of the narratives most of which entirely contradict each other lavrov skripals poisoned with quinuclidinyl benzilate bz thats according to swiss lab that worked with the samples that london handed over to the opcw toxin never produced in russia was in service in the us uk other nato states rt april exterminating traitors is russias official state policy they claim that the russian leadership has on multiple occasions stated that extermination of traitors abroad is a state policy of russia shulgin said this is slander of course the british cannot produce a single example of such statements since the russian leadership has never said anything of the kind experts pin the blame on russia the head of the opcw mission has clearly said that it was impossible to determine in which country the toxic substance used in salisbury had originated yet the opcw findings were once again used by the uk officials to claim moscow was highly likely responsible look the head said it was impossible and they abandoning all common sense said theyve confirmed our evaluations that it was russia how else can you evaluate this but as a lie shulgin wondered moscow diplomats accused london of failing to disclose location health status of yulia skripal rt april novichok is a soviet invention so it has to be russia the development of the socalled novichok family of toxic agents more than years ago in the soviet union was one of the main cornerstones in the uk narrative pinning blame for the skripal incident on russia publicly available sources however indicate that the west has been and still is conducting research and development into such substances shulgin said giving a fresh example of such activities not long ago namely on december the us patent and trademark office filed a request to its russian colleagues asking to check patentability of a chemical weaponryfilled bullet which could be equipped with tabun sarin or the novichok family of agents the official stated yulia skripal avoids contact with relatives refuses russian consular support while such a statement was indeed produced by the uk authorities on behalf of yulia moscow believes it to be false according to shulgin the situation with yulia is starting to look like a russian citizen is effectively being held hostage by the uk authorities if you like this story share it with a friend,pro-russian,2

https://www.rt.com/news/424085-uk-government-reputation-skripal-yakovenko/,1033,737,the skripal case has raised a lot of questions which are posed not only by moscow but by the british people the russian ambassador to the uk told rt and failure to answer them puts the uk governments reputation on the line we have the strategic patience and what were going to do is to just press the british government because they have to give a reply not only to us but also to the british people russian ambassador to the uk alexander yakovenko told rt in an exclusive interview the uk government has started answering some of the questions but the pace is still very slow and the major ones remain unanswered the scandal erupted in early march when former double agent sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were found in critical condition in the town of salisbury top uk officials pinned the blame on moscow but they are yet to release evidence to back up the accusations were working every day so were asking more and more questions the government has started answering these questions but very very lets say in a shrink way but still were trying to involve them in this process yakovenko said but what seriously matters is that why the government is doing this why are they declining all our requests why have they classified all the information the russian position on the case remains unchanged yakovenko stressed moscow believes that the whole skripal scandal was a huge false flag operation but we have to prove it while the uk government is likely to have a political motivation for blaming russia the diplomat said its too early to draw definitive conclusions for now finding out the truth behind what really happened is key the political motivation might actually take its roots in brexit as the uk seeks its place under the sun in the new reality yakovenko said if you read the national security strategy you will find that russia in this strategy and this is an official document of the british government russia is the enemy number one to britain so this is written in the paper the diplomat stated theresa may in her famous banquet speech announced that britain will take a lead in the deterrence of russia in order to follow this policy you have to have the support of the people thats why all the media campaigns are basically targeted to the people in order to prove that russia is an evil and to support the allegations of the british government inconsistencies in the case the media offensive and the lack of solid evidence however have raised questions among the british people themselves and put the governments reputation at stake yakovenko said this in turn defeats the stated purpose of the uk becoming the main deterrent of russia without the support of the people its very difficult to do that what we see today the people dont believe the government they put a lot of questions and if you read the social media they are asking why the government is pursuing such a policy in order to get the goal you have to press more and more thats why you hear all these stories all these fake news yakovenko said i think that at the stake they have their reputation because the people are asking more and more questions whos running the country is britain committed to international obligations so the reputation of the country the reputation of the government is at stake and i believe this is quite a strong motivation for the british,pro-russian,2
