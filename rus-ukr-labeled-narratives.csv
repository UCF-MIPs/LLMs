8071,"Refugees, reporting and the far right: how the Ukraine crisis reveals brutal â€˜everyday racismâ€™ in Europe and beyond",please be advised this article features accounts of racism and racist discourse including mentions of nazism the intensifying conflict in ukraine has raised the issue of racism not only in ukraine but europe three specific and related dimensions of racism are evident in this complex conflict discrimination against african and asian nationals fleeing ukraine shocking reports emerged in the past week of discrimination faced by african and asian nationals mainly international students in ukraine who were among the over million people seeking refuge in neighbouring poland hungary romania slovakia and moldova african and asian people were forcibly prevented from boarding trains and buses leaving ukrainian cities as priority was given to white ukrainians those who finally reached the polish border some even on foot found that again white ukrainians were prioritised entry some african asian and middleeastern nationals were met by verbal and physical abuse on arrival many african asian and middle eastern nationals spent two to three days at border checkpoints and reported lack of food water accommodation or basic support in freezing winter conditions while they waited to get through a statement issued by the african union condemned reports about the treatment of africans as shockingly racist and in breach of international law and observed all people have the right to cross international borders during conflict and as such should enjoy the same rights to cross to safety from the conflict in ukraine notwithstanding their nationality or racial identity read more how we mourn the victims of tragedies depends on their citizenship status racist mainstream media portrayals equally disturbing is the unthinkingly racist mainstream media framing of ukrainian refugees in comparison to the framing of refugees from syria iraq or afghanistan or africa below a selection of such racist commentary from major news outlets this isnt iraq or afghanistan this is a relatively civilised relatively european city charlie dagata cbs war is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations daniel hannan the telegraph whats compelling is looking at them the way they are dressed these are prosperous middleclass people these are not obviously refugees trying to get away from the middle east or north africa they look like any european family that youd live next door to peter dobbie al jazeera these descriptions of ukrainian refugees invidiously position them as more civilised and superior to refugees from the middle east african or asian nations this seems to imply that ukrainian lives are worth saving while the lives of millions of others who seek refuge are more disposable because they are people who are not welldressed middleclass dont look like us or live in more remote supposedly less civilised locations read more ways to spot polarizing language how to choose responsibly what to amplify online or inperson whitesupremacist ukrainian mobilisation the third and more dangerous dimension of racism is the mobilisation of the neofacist white supremacist azov movement in ukraine since azov started as a volunteer battalion that was then officially integrated into the national guard of ukraine in november the current ukrainian government has not made comment on this movement in the current crisis azov battalion is training ukrainian civilians for guerrillastyle combat with the russian military however it is important to also note that similar white nationalist groups exist across europe and north america therefore putins claim of denazification of ukraine is a flimsy reason for invasion of ukraine while the azov battalion officially denies adhering to white supremacist ideologies azovs street patrol called national militia were responsible for attacks on roma in ukraine in azov also plays a pivotal role in the global network of farright whitenationalist extremism it participated in training and radicalising united statesbased white supremacy organizations according to a fbi affidavit closer to home alongside other european farright movements azovs propaganda appears to have inspired brenton tarrant of australia in his deadly terrorist attack on a mosque in christchurch in this was evidenced by the sonnerad or black sun on his jacket a symbol commonly used by the azov battalion and farright brands in france read more the us is boosting aid to ukraine questions answered what accounts for these three dimensions of racism in the ukraine crisis and how are they connected research suggests racism and xenophobia varies with the relationship between hostile government policies and antimigrant sentiments of the population in short the problem of racism is not just ukrainian or eastern european it is european more nuanced analysis argues there is insufficient evidence to show eastern europeans are more xenophobic than western europeans any analysis should consider the complex histories of migration from and through eastern european countries indeed as the global news coverage of ukrainan refugees demonstrates everyday racism or what goorie author melissa lucashenko refers to as white normal savagery is not restricted to eastern europe all three dimensions of racism discussed here are the manifestation of global systemic institutionalised racism and imperialism acknowledgement of this institutionalised racism and imperialism would begin by first recognising the ukraine crisis as a power struggle between the usnato and russia underwritten by interests of weapons manufacturers and oil companies this crisis was long predicted by strategic observers of global politics recognising the wider context of institutionalised racism would allow us to connect the current racist treatment of african and asian migrants in the ukraine crisis to deadly european border policies over the past decades these policies have led to increasing numbers of migrants mostly from africa and the middle east reported as missing in the mediterranean since azov needs to be recognised as the belligerently violent face of a racialised political order that is potentially dangerous however this would require holding the us accountable for its suspected support of azov and its refusal along with ukraine to condemn the glorification of nazism in a un resolution in finally we should recognise that any moves to dismantle institutionalised racism are unlikely to be undertaken voluntarily as professor of sociology jzsef brcz argues the defining element of whiteness is a claim indeed demand for unconditional global privilege that is always being

2854,"Internet Research Agency Appears To Be Back, Pushing Propaganda",this story first appeared at propublica propublica is a pulitzer prizewinning investigative newsroom sign up for the big story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox just before am moscow standard time on march after a night of russian strikes on kyiv and other ukrainian cities a set of russianlanguage twitter accounts spread a lie that ukraine was fabricating civilian casualties one account created last year nenuche shared a video of a man standing in front of rows of dark gray body bags that appeared to be filled with corpses as he spoke to the camera one of the encased bodies behind him lifted its arms to stop the top of the bag from blowing away the video was taken from an austrian tv report about a climate change demonstration held in vienna in february but nenuche claimed it was from ukraine propaganda makes mistakes too one of the corpses came back to life right as they were counting the deaths of ukraines civilians the tweet said eight minutes later another account enotkremlebot tweeted the same video im screaming one of the corpses came back to life during a segment about civilian deaths in the ukraine information war is reaching a new level they said two other accounts created last fall within a few days of enotkremlebot soon shared the same video and accusations of fake civilian casualties ukrainian propaganda does not sleep said one the twitter profiles are part of a proputin network of dozens of accounts spread across twitter tiktok and instagram whose behavior content and coordination are consistent with russian troll factory the internet research agency according to darren linvill a clemson university professor who along with another professor patrick warren has spent years studying ira accounts the ira burst into the american consciousness after its paid trolls used thousands of englishlanguage accounts across social media platforms to influence american voters during the presidential election the ira was at the center of a department of justice criminal indictment for its alleged effort to interfere with elections and political processes these accounts express every indicator that we have to suggest they originate with the internet research agency linvill said and if they arent the ira thats worse because i dont know whos doing it an analysis of the accounts activity by the clemson media forensics hub and propublica found they posted at defined times consistent with the ira workday were created in the same time frame and posted similar or identical text photos and videos across accounts and platforms posts from twitter accounts in the network dropped off on weekends and russian holidays suggesting the posters had regular work schedules many of the accounts also shared content from facktoriacom a satirical russian website that began publishing in february its domain registration records are private and its unclear who operates it twitter removed its account after being contacted by propublica the proputin network included roughly twitter accounts over on tiktok and at least seven on instagram according to the analysis and removals by the platforms linvill and warren said the twitter accounts share strong connections with a set of hundreds of accounts they identified a year ago as likely being run by the ira twitter removed nearly all of those accounts it did not attribute them to the ira the most successful accounts were on tiktok where a set of roughly a dozen analyzed by clemson researchers and propublica racked up more than million views and over million likes with posts that promoted russian government statements mocked president joe biden and shared fake russian factchecking videos that were revealed by propublica and clemson researchers earlier this week on twitter they attacked jailed russian opposition leader alexei navalny and blamed the west for preventing russian athletes from competing under the russian flag in the olympics late last month the network of accounts shifted to focus almost exclusively on ukraine echoing similar narratives and content across accounts and platforms a popular post by the account qrkod accused the ukrainian military of using civilians as human shields another post by qrkod portrayed ukraine as provoking russia at the behest of its nato masters both tweets received hundreds of likes and retweets and were posted on the same day as the body bag video at least two twitter accounts in the network also shared fake factchecking videos the findings indicate that professionalized trolling remains a force in domestic russian propaganda efforts and continues to adapt across platforms according to linvill i cant stress enough the importance of understanding the way that this is a tool for putin to control narratives among his own people a way for him to lie to his own people and control the conversation linvill said to suggest that the west is blanketly winning this information war is true only in some places putin doesnt have to win the information war he just has to hold his ground and these accounts are helping him do that after inquiries from propublica all of the active accounts were removed from tiktok and nearly all were suspended by twitter meta said it removed one instagram account for violating its spam policy and that the others did not violate its rules none of the platforms attribute the accounts to the ira twitter and tiktok said the accounts engaged in coordinated behavior or other activity that violated platform policies a tiktok spokesperson said the initial eight accounts shared with it violated its policy against harmful misinformation tiktok removed an additional accounts it determined were part of the same proputin network we continue to respond to the war in ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation said a statement provided by the company we also partner with independent factchecking organizations to support our efforts to help tiktok remain a safe and authentic place tiktok removed at least three additional russianlanguage accounts that clemson researchers said are part of the same network the company declined to say how many accounts in total it removed as part of this action a twitter spokesperson called the roughly accounts it removed malicious and said they violated its platform manipulation and spam policy but declined to be more specific they said the company had determined that the active accounts shared by propublica had violated its policies prior to being asked about them twitter decided to leave the set of accounts online to make it harder for bad actors to understand our detections according to the spokesperson the accounts were removed by twitter within hours of propublica contacting the company about them the week before twitter removed accounts that the clemson researchers also identified as likely ira accounts our investigation into these accounts remains ongoing and we will take further action when necessary said a statement from a twitter spokesperson as is standard when we identify information operation campaigns that we can reliably attribute to statelinked activity we will disclose this to the public twitter declined to offer more details on why it left roughly accounts that it identified as violative online to continue spreading propaganda it also declined to comment on connections between the roughly accounts in this recent network and the hundreds of accounts flagged by linvill and warren last spring as possible ira profiles linvill said he identified the recent accounts largely based on their commonality with the previous set of i connect these current accounts to the ongoing activity over the course of the past year by carefully tracking accounts tactics techniques and procedures he said platforms may be hesitant to attribute activity to the ira in part because the agency has adapted and made its efforts harder to expose according to linvill but he said social platforms should disclose more information about the networks it removes even if it cant say with certainty who is running them in every other area of cybersecurity dangerous activity from bad actors is disclosed routinely without full confidence in the source of the activity we name and disclose computer viruses or hacker groups for instance because that is in the public interest he said the platforms should do the same the russian people should know that some sophisticated and wellorganized group is covertly using social media to encourage support for putin and the war in ukraine the internet research agency is a private company owned by yevgeny prigozhin a russian entrepreneur known as putins chef prigozhin is linked to a sprawling empire ranging from catering services to the military mercenary company wagner group which was reportedly tasked with assassinating president volodymyr zelenskyy the ira launched in st petersburg in by hiring young internetsavvy people to post on blogs discussion forums and social media to promote putins agenda to a domestic audience after being exposed for its efforts to influence the us election the ira attempted to outsource some of its englishlanguage operations to ghana ahead of efforts to reach prigozhin were unsuccessful but it never stopped its core work of influencing russianspeaking audiences the ira is part of a sprawling domestic state propaganda operation whose current impact can be seen by the number of russians who refuse to believe that an invasion has happened while asserting that ukrainians are being held hostage by a nazi coup prior to the invasion accounts in the network identified by the clemson media forensics hub and propublica celebrated russian achievements at the olympics they were deep in the olympics tweeting about russian victories and the olympics and how the russians were being robbed by the west and not allowed to compete under their own flag linvill said after the invasion began they moved to unify people behind putins war it was a slow shift he said and this is something ive seen from the ira before when a significant world event happens they dont always know immediately how to respond to it by late february the network had found its voice in part by echoing messages from russian officialdom the accounts justified the invasion blamed nato and the west and seeded doubts about civilian death tolls and russian military setbacks when sanctions kicked in and western companies began pulling out of russia they said it was good news because russian products are better two twitter accounts in the network shared the same video of a man smashing an old ipad with a hammer these accounts were sophisticated they knew their audience and they got engagement far surpassing the number of followers that they had linvill said paul stronski a senior fellow in the russia and eurasia program at the carnegie endowment for peace reviewed content shared by more than two dozen of the twitter accounts prior to their suspension a lot of this is the type of stuff i would expect from russian trolls said stronski who reads and speaks russian he said many of the accounts adopt an approachable and humorous tone to generate engagement and appear relatable to younger audiences present on social media theyre very critical of prominent russians who have criticized this war questioning their patriotism stronski said theyre saying in effect that during wartime you shouldnt be criticizing your own you should be lining up behind the state when president biden flubbed the pronunciation of ukrainians during his recent state of the union address several of the accounts on twitter tiktok and instagram shared the clip and mocked him while that clip spread widely outside of the suspected ira network as well the accounts often spread more obscure content in coordination multiple twitter accounts for example shared a screenshot of a russian actors tweet that he cared more about being able to use apple pay than the war in ukraine the accounts criticized him with one warning that the internet remembers everything before the account takedowns the russian government had begun closing off the country from global social media and information sources it restricted access to twitter and blocked facebook the russian legislature passed a law that allows for a year sentence for people who contradict the official government position on the war as a result tiktok announced it would pause uploads of new videos in russia some of the accounts in the network saw the writing on the wall and prepared their audience to move to telegram a russian messaging service friends with happiness id like to tell you that i decided to make the tmeenotkremlebot channel in which you will see analytics to the fullest extent

330,Ukraine: the problem with copying Finlandâ€™s strict cold war neutrality,during the tense negotiations over the ukraine crisis the idea of finlandizing ukraine has been suggested as a solution this idea refers to the way a small or weak country can retain its sovereignty by making some policy decisions generally defence and foreign subject to considerable influence by a more powerful neighbour it applied originally to the situation finland found itself in during the cold war when faced with threats from the soviet union finland enforced a strict neutrality remaining outside both nato and the warsaw pact by these means it avoided invasion or occupation by soviet forces the idea surfaced when the french president emmanuel macron was reportedly asked by a reporter in moscow recently whether finlandization would work for ukraine he replied yes it is one of the options on the table he has since denied the report ukraine has made no secret of its wish to join nato and the eu both of which demonstrate its leaning towards the west if he did indeed suggest finlandization macron and his advisers appear to be proposing that ukraine would have no choice but to accept moscows control of some of its policies comparisons can be drawn between this crisis and that of czechoslovakia in with britain and france negotiating over czechoslovakia in an attempt to avoid war with germany over its territorial ambitions there the situation is strikingly similar the potential imposition of an agreement on an unwilling state stripped of the ability to realistically defend itself

""external factors""",which external factors might have spooked the european union from the return of the iran deal they pushed over the last five years vladimir putin certainly counts among them but does joe biden as well whatever the cause the sudden stop in momentum toward an agreement came as a surprise the european union foreign policy chief has said that talks in vienna to resurrect the nuclear accord between iran and global powers should be paused because of external factors a pause in viennatalks is needed due to external factors said josep borrell on twitter on friday at the end of a week in which western officials had hoped a deal would be announced the islamic republic has been in indirect talks with the us brokered by the eu for the past months a final text is essentially ready and on the table added borrell as coordinator i will with my team continue to be in touch with all participants and the us to overcome the current situation and to close the agreement the fact that this pause came out of the eu seems rather significant especially since it looked as though biden and his team were sprinting toward a complete capitulation former state department official

4435,Russian Attack Aircraft With Nuclear Weapons On Board Violate Swedish Air Space as Sweden Mulls NATO Membership,one thing vladimir putins premeditated and unprovoked invasion of ukraine has accomplished is to strip away any illusion that russia is much more than an ineffectual bully the prime example of this is how putin has repeatedly waved about the threat of nuclear weapons it started

because of offending the russians they need for an iran nuclear deal putin has since continued to make nuclear threats on at least a weekly basis here here one incident was when russian foreign

kaliningrad they consisted of two sukhoi attack planes which were escorted by two sukhoi fighter jets it was the two attack planes which were according to tv nyheter sources equipped with nuclear weapons the violation of swedish territory lasted for about a minute the countrys air force deployed two jas gripen which took pictures of the intruders it was then say swedish media that it was

everything indicates that it was a deliberate act that they violated swedens borders weve known about the violation of airspace since it happened however the revelation of the nuclear weapons is new there are three things of note here first and foremost the decision to fly nucleararmed aircraft into another nations airspace cannot be a mistake and it is probably an event unique in the military

9040,Russia-Ukraine War Headed for a Bloody Stalemate,the frontlines in russias war against ukraine have barely moved for more than a week there is some indication that russia is in the midst of a resupply mission to its troops but the simpler explanation is that ukraine has throttled the russian advance in all sectors and that putin is either going to have to direct more resources to the war or alter his objectives western intelligence experts are guessing when they say russia is suffering about casualties a day ukrainian government numbers are even more shocking while there are indications that some of the combat has been incredibly intense russia has probably not had troops killed or wounded in the days since the invasion but according to the respected institute for the study of war a dc think tank russias failures have led to a stalemate scenario that could be vicious and bloody the culmination of the initial russian campaign is creating conditions of stalemate throughout most of ukraine russian forces are digging in around the periphery of kyiv and elsewhere attempting to consolidate political control over areas they currently occupy resupplying and attempting to reinforce units in static positions and generally beginning to set conditions to hold in approximately their current forward positions for an indefinite time maxar imagery of russian forces digging trenches and revetments in kyiv oblast over the past several days supports this assessment comments by duma members about forcing ukraine to surrender by exhaustion in may could reflect a revised russian approach to ending this conflict on terms favorable to moscow thats the only way that putin will stop fighting when he has terms favorable to moscow that means tens of thousands of civilian casualties and destroyed ukrainian cities it also means a bloody nose and perhaps worse a humiliation for the russian military the world war i battles of the somme verdun and passchendaele were all fought in conditions of stalemate and did not break the stalemate if the war in ukraine settles into a stalemate condition russian forces will continue to bomb and bombard ukrainian cities devastating them and killing civilians even as ukrainian forces impose losses on russian attackers and conduct counterattacks of their own the russians could hope to break ukrainians will to continue fighting under such circumstances by demonstrating kyivs inability to expel russian forces or stop their attacks even if the russians are demonstrably unable to take ukraines cities ukraines defeat of the initial russian campaign may therefore set conditions for a devastating protraction of the conflict and a dangerous new period testing the resolve of ukraine and the west continued and expanded western support to ukraine will be vital to seeing ukraine through that new period as long as zelenskyy feels that biden and nato have his back he will resist hes certainly not going to get favorable terms from putin russia will probably occupy some ukrainian territory when the fighting stops and zelenskyy may be forced to accept the notion of neutrality the scenario of a stalemate would be bad for putin but catastrophic for ukraine if he gets the chance zelenskyy will end the war as quickly as

9913,Trudy Rubin: The only way to end Putinâ€™s war crimes is to help Ukrainian forces win,the gruesome images of slain civilians in bucha and other liberated towns near kyiv have been met with furious rhetoric from western politicians yet there is only one way to stop vladimir putins forces from committing more hideous war crimes it is not by placing more sanctions on russia though they are welcome it is not the suspension of russia from the un human rights council it should be suspended from the un general assembly and it is not peace talks that putin permits primarily to fool some european leaders putin can only be stopped if washington and nato allies provide ukraine with all the weapons it needs to defeat russian forces the critical battles will happen in the coming weeks in eastern ukraine as soon as russian forces recoup from being pushed back from kyiv yet the most critical weapons systems and vehicles have yet to arrive how many buchas have to take place for the west to do what we are asking ukraines foreign minister dmytro kuleba asked plaintively at an emergency nato meeting on thursday that is the question nato members need to answer now in fairness more western weapons are pouring in every day and the united states has committed billion in defense aid to ukraine this year ukrainians tell me they are grateful donald trump is no longer president since he justified putins annexation of crimea and praised the russia leaders genius at the beginning of the current invasion trumps open disdain for ukraine and for president volodymyr zelenskyy and his affinity for putin have not been forgotten in kyiv still us and nato aid has ramped up much too slowly in a bitter tweet the antirussian chess star and opposition activist garry kasparov argues the issue with western response hasnt changed since putin first invaded ukraine in horrified by what has happened unwilling to act to stop it while it is happening unable to plan so it doesnt happen again each week as nato countries face more outrages by putin they up the ante with weapons delivery but they always appear behind the need of the moment us deliveries of javelin antitank weapons and stinger shortrange antiaircraft missiles have been essential in helping ukraine hold off the russians and remain critical but the systems necessary to defeat moscow in upcoming battles still havent arrived ukraine has been unable to close the skies to the missiles and bombs that have ravaged kharkiv mariupol and other cities slovakia bulgaria and greece have russianmade s antimissiles systems but have not been willing to loan them to ukraine unless the united states is willing to loan those countries comparable systems in the meantime nor has kyiv received the antiship missiles it needs immediately to help save the port city of odesa even though the united states norway and poland have such systems the us bureaucracy simply hasnt been told that its wartime i was told by the former deputy secretary general of nato alexander vershbow the mig s airplanes havent moved longrange air defenses havent moved its so frustrating the pipeline of weapons is moving very slowly at a time when russians are more vulnerable than they will be in a few weeks said vershbow also a former us ambassador to moscow by which time the russians will be capable of fixing their performance indeed as i have been speaking this week with ukrainian friends and contacts in kyiv i have heard the same message over and over we are expecting putins forces to come back here after they regroup in belarus that means the next few weeks are crucial as russian troops reorganize and as many russian soldiers troops and mercenaries move toward eastern ukraine for a big land battle in the donbas region the czech republic has offered ukraine desperately need tanks but ukrainians worry whether they will get there in time the ukrainians believe putins current goal is to expand russian occupation of big swathes

7765,An 85-year-old law paves the way for Canadians to fight in Ukraine,ukrainian president volodymr zelensky recently announced that ukraines armed forces will welcome foreign volunteers and build an international brigade following russias invasion of his country soon after his announcement british foreign secretary liz truss expressed her support for britons seeking to fight for ukraine canadian foreign affairs minister of foreign affairs mlanie joly made similar remarks we understand that people of ukrainian descent want to support their fellow ukrainians and also that there is a desire to defend the motherland and in that sense it is their own individual decision let me be clear we are all very supportive of any form of support to ukrainians right now canadian defence minister anita anand similarly told all foreigners willing to defend ukraine and world order to contact the foreign diplomatic missions of ukraine calls for help ukraines call for foreign volunteers is nothing new embattled nations have long called upon adventurers diasporas religious adherents and ideological sympathizers to join in their struggles canadians have an equally long history of answering such calls including during the us civil war in the s and the spanish civil war in the s these volunteers can play a variety of roles in some cases they might be specialists like pilots or medical doctors who are in short supply and are urgently needed in other conflicts foreign volunteers can appreciably add to the mass of a countrys military force regardless of the quantity or type of volunteers the call for help is perhaps most important in signalling a simple message we are not alone zelensky is unambiguously telling the world that ukraines fight is everyones fight ukraines cause is everyones cause and once foreign volunteers are in place this message becomes clearer and stronger the canadian pressfred greenslade the plight of the ukrainian people is there for all to see on social media right now imagine the impact of videos from the front lines narrated by a torontonian a winnipegger or an edmontonian this type of involvement in war zones is what the canadian government has sought to avoid in the past getting canadians home amid or after a conflict whether theyre released from service or held in prisonerofwar camps costs money and political capital claims of neutrality are questioned volunteers fighting in foreign wars can lead foreign governments and voters to question a countrys claims of neutrality if it has opted not to get directly involved in the conflict killed or wounded canadians can also ignite heated debates about what constitutes a veteran since theyre not members of the canadian armed forces and who will provide for the returned volunteers or their families these issues can be particularly challenging when they illuminate sectarian or ideological divides just before confederation in as many as canadians went to fight for american federal forces during the us civil war even as other british north americans supported the confederacy most notably in the maritimes recruiters were prosecuted in police courts but not the volunteers themselves in the spanish civil war nearly canadian volunteers fought to defend spains elected government others notably conservatives in qubec like premier maurice duplessis decried the volunteer movements connection to the communist party of canada and lauded the leader of the nationalist rebellion gen francisco franco as the hero of catholicism the foreign enlistment act these tensions caused a unity crisis and compelled prime minister william lyon mackenzie king and justice minister ernest lapointe to pass the countrys foreign enlistment act in they applied the act to the situation in spain by an orderincouncil the act remains in effect today it prohibits canadians from joining the armed forces of any nation at war with any friendly state so in a conflict in which canada is genuinely neutral that means canadians cant join the armed forces of any belligerent party in the present war the statute would prohibit a canadian from joining the russian military but not ukraines in the act allowed king and lapointe to argue they were doing something about canadian volunteers in spain recruiters largely organized by the communist party of canada kept most of their efforts underground and quiet to avoid prosecution the canadian volunteers were not seriously investigated although charges were nearly pressed against the recruiters the endeavour was abandoned when the rcmp and the department of justice feared public backlash the acts prohibition on recruiting is broad its an offence to recruit within canada for the armed forces of any state friendly or hostile however consular and diplomatic officers of that foreign state are allowed to engage in such activities this is presumably why canadian officials have pointed potential volunteers to ukrainian embassies and consulates any prospective grassroots recruiters would be wise to take the same approach the canadian pressdarryl dyck canada is largely behind ukraine the tensions exacerbated by canadian volunteers in previous wars and the corresponding desire for strategic ambiguity by the federal government arent present in the current crisis canadians seem to be universally in ukraines corner the canadian presschris young the statements by joly and anand have helped eliminate ambiguity at a moment when time is of the essence this is not to say that the other costs of foreign volunteerism will vanish if canadian volunteers go to ukraine some will undoubtedly be killed or captured but as joly has indicated this is a risk the volunteers must accept of their own volition after ukraine and russia canada is home to more people of ukrainian descent than any other country on earth the census shows million canadians of ukrainian ancestry a third of which are aged to in other words of fighting age we can only guess how many of them might contemplate the idea but if even a fraction elect to make the journey there could soon be large numbers of canadians in

forces have fired more than missiles the official said the kremlin has already used belarus as a location from which to pour its troops quickly across the border into ukraine after insisting the large number of forces assembled there were for joint military drills the us has also seen some indications that russia in some areas of ukraine is employing mercenaries from the shadowy russian military contractor the wagner group though details on where or how many are not clear the official also said russian forces are frustrated they have not yet taken the capital city of kyiv which could lead them to take a more aggressive approach militarily they have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on kyiv they said one of the things that that could result in is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt in both the size and scale of their targeting of kyiv the russians are running out of gas and theyre having logistics problems on the way south to kyiv and have also met significant ukrainian resistance still the kremlin forces are roughly miles away from the capital city which they hope to encircle

also said russian forces are frustrated they have not yet taken the capital city of kyiv which could lead them to take a more aggressive approach militarily they have been slowed and have been frustrated by their lack of progress on kyiv the official said one of the things that that could result in is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt in both the size and scale of their targeting ofkyiv the russians are running out of gas and theyre having logistics problems on the way south to kyiv and have also met significant ukrainian

been where the heaviest fighting has been they said they are also having logistics issues and are having problems getting gas to the capital the official added that the rrussians are hoping to encircling the city and take it in that way as that is the best way to take control of the city it is also believed that the russian forces are using mercenaries in some areas of u kraine though

309,China is making sanctions on Russia irrelevant,the invasion of ukraine can now begin china from all appearances has given vladimir putin the one thing he needs to defy the united states and the international community the russian autocrat looks like he has secured an economic lifeline from beijing what everybody forgets here is russia needs to be able to sell that gas and sell that oil president joe biden said monday during his press conference with german chancellor olaf scholz russia relies a significant part of russias budget its the only thing they really have to export and if in fact its cut off then theyre going to be hurt very badly biden was talking about nord stream the pipeline slated to carry russian gas to europe through germany if russia invades ukraine washington does not want the pipeline to start operation the russian strongman was one step ahead of the american president however putin in beijing on feb for the opening ceremony of the winter olympics announced billion of new oil and gas deals with china our oilmen have prepared very good new solutions on hydrocarbon supplies to the peoples republic of china he declared the new deals will not help russia with the current crisis gas will not start flowing over a new pipeline to china for at least two years but beijing can increase purchases of russian hydrocarbons under existing arrangements nonetheless beijings message to the united states and others was unmistakable the russian and chinese governments have made clear to the world that their joint confrontation with the united states will include a strategy of taking care of each others needs jonathan ward the author of chinas vision of victory told me after putins announcement of the oil and gas deals china through its economic courtship of iran has already demonstrated its willingness to work with nations that have been sanctioned by the west beijings support suggests it is thinking of taking advantage of the conflict in eastern europe to engage in mischief of its own as ward says the russiachina relationship has been blossoming on a wide range of fronts military energy infrastructure even authoritarian ideology and we should expect that beijing will want to throw a lifeline to its partners in the kremlin in part because distracting america in eastern europe may keep us off balance in asia the announcement of the new russiachina oil and gas arrangements makes washingtons warnings seem hollow or at least behindthetimes we have and when i say we i mean collectively the united states and our allies and partners we have an array of tools that we can deploy if we see foreign companies including those in china doing their best to backfill us export control actions to evade them to get around them said state department spokesperson ned price last week during his regular press briefing chinas commitment to buy more russian oil and gas certainly qualifies as backfilling especially because biden has identified hydrocarbon sales as the core of putins economy which means they are essential to putins war machine the concern is not theoretical reuters reports that russia might use a field already under us sanctions to supply gas to china pursuant to the justannounced deals after putins more than twoandahalfhour meeting on friday with xi jinping moscow and beijing issued a joint statement announcing that the new interstate relations between china and russia are superior to political and military alliances of the cold war era friendship between the two states the statement declared has no limits there are no forbidden areas of cooperation price the state department spox has an answer no partnership he said last week can account for the massive economic toll that weve talked about given the financial tools that are available to us the sanctions tools that are available to us and the export control actions among others that were in a position to take yes the united states can cripple russia but only if the us prevents chinese backfilling us policymakers with the exception of those in the trump years have fervently believed that engaging the chinese state would encourage it to become a responsible stakeholder in the international system american policy therefore has generally been extraordinarily indulgent ignoring blatant chinese sanctionsbusting in the belief that beijing would eventually come to see things washingtons way the result is that china has suffered almost no cost in openly and continually violating us and un sanctions on for instance the islamic republic of iran and the democratic peoples republic of korea chinese policymakers know that americans can impose what ward calls statekiller sanctions on them but they appear to believe the biden administration would not dare therefore china appears ready to backfill and shows no fear in fueling russian aggression america consequently must now get ready for conflicts on both ends of the

7484,Ukraine in the Colosseum,its not as if the us and its nato allies have failed to react to vladimir putins amplifying threats and current onslaught against ukraine weve seen months of frantic usled diplomacy european visits to the kremlin speeches in munich additional us troops dispatched to reinforce nato un security council meetings and new sanctions on top of old sanctions nonetheless its hard to escape the sense that the mighty democracies of the west are not so much standing with ukraine as sitting like spectators at the colosseum watching ukraine do single combat against russia to be sure the us and its allies are rooting for ukraine providing ukraine with military hardware and logistical support and rolling out stacks of sanctions and condemnations and other nonkinetic punishments for russia but this is now a gunfight a war not a diplomatic dinner party or a harvard seminar yes formal alliances matter and ukraine is not part of the member nato alliance but right now ukraine is the frontline in a showdown over the unwritten rules of the prevailing world order and you can bet chinas dictator xi jinping with his own predatory ambitions is watching and learning plenty about how we handle such things these days when biden says repeatedly that he will not send troops to fight russia because thats a world war when americans and russians start shooting at one another thats a clear message to putin that if hes willing to send guns into nonnato terrain its open season america might send aid but americas mighty armed forces will steer clear in that calculus it is no longer america deterring russia but russia deterring us putting america on the defensive is clearly part of that putin playbook from which the white house has been sharing selected excerpts with the world among the items the white house has not been publicizing is the leverage putin enjoys when the white house is filled with people so terrified of triggering his next aggressive move that they carry on trying to cajole and appease him until after hes made it at that stage witness the explosions now taking place in kyiv russias predations become far more damaging costly and hard to reverse putin took advantage of much the same white house hesitancy during the obamabiden administration when putin in seized crimea from ukraine and effectively dared the free world to do anything about it obama scolded and rolled out sanctions russia absorbed them and kept crimea following bidens august debacle in afghanistan and the shackling of us energy while waving ahead russian gas for germany last year putin evidently concluded the stars had aligned to invade the rest of ukraine its far more compelling right now to muster respect for the latenight comedian turned courageous president of ukraine volodymyr zelenskyy risking his life in his countrys defense than to trust the career politician turned president of america now weekending in delaware having urged us all to wait a month to see what sanctions can do were hearing a lot from biden and his team about how russias war on ukraine is animating and unifying nato biden is doing the right thing in dispatching more troops to shore up natos members in eastern europe but thats not a big help to ukrainians now fighting for their country in a hot war when the us offered to evacuate zelenskyy his response said it all the fight is here i need ammunition not a ride nor is it clear that natos vaunted unity is all that unified germany a pivotal nato member which for years has chosen a lifestyle entailing a small military and big reliance on russian gas does not inspire confidence despite the suspension for now of opening up nord stream to bring more gas from russia ill believe the germans mean it when they rip out the actual pipeline one of the most despicable scenes as putin massed his forces to threaten ukraine was germany refusing last month to greenlight the export of germanorigin weapons to ukraine from the baltics themselves high on putins hit list despite their nato memberships germany has now reversed its policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones with chancellor olaf scholz noticing at this late hour that russias invasion of ukraine threatens our entire postwar order germany is now allowing transit and plans to send antiaircraft weapons to ukraine or and this is now the problem whatever is left of it biden says that if nato is attacked america will fight for every inch as article of the nato charter requires an attack on one will be treated as an attack on all thats great and america must stand by it but if we are then to avoid the moment in putins escalating game of chicken when he tests bidens precarious credibility by turning his guns on nato members such as the baltics and poland something more is needed we can debate the quicker the better what that should be but it has got to entail better strategy tougher resolve and more willingness to take the risks needed to deter not only russia but china with its sights now on taiwan and beyond surely it is not actually good for nato or for the rest of the free world if america defaults to a strategy of sharing box seats with its formal allies at the colosseum while friendly polities not privileged with any formal alliance are forced one by one into the arena to do single combat with russia or for that matter china,https://pjmedia.com/claudiarosett/2022/02/26/ukraine-in-the-colosseum-n1562140,Neutral,1,the mighty democracies of the west are not so much standing with ukraine as sitting like

1001,"Putin is on a personal mission to rewrite Cold War history, making the risks in Ukraine far graver",there is no shortage of speculation about what russian president vladimir putin intends to do with the vast russian military force now virtually encircling ukraine and why he has amassed it its sheer size the largest combat force assembled in europe since the second world war suggests a maximalist approach erasing the humiliation of the soviet unions breakup years ago with a massive bloody and swift invasion of ukraine on multiple fronts indeed a fullscale attack looks increasingly imminent with an estimated of russian forces now in combatready position and separatist leaders in eastern ukraine formally requesting help combating what they falsely claim is aggression from the ukrainian military others see it differently believing putin will be content with his gains so far some also consider russias recognition of the breakaway regions of donetsk and luhansk in eastern ukraine as signalling a muscular warning to western leaders who have repeatedly ignored russian security concerns another view suggests putin will opt for a hybrid strategy similar to russias playbook in its war with georgia threatening to use force formally recognising breakaway provinces and destroying its adversarys military but stopping short of actual conquest putins anger laid bare who is right each scenario is feasible but the question of how to interpret russian motives became clearer after putins bizarre february meeting with his security council in moscow at the meeting he humiliated russian spy chief sergei naryshkin for forgetting the script and supporting the incorporation of donetsk and luhansk directly into russia instead of just recognising their independence the meeting was a prerecorded charade even the time shown on putins own watch suggested the signing ceremony to recognise the independence of donetsk and luhansk had occurred before the meeting with his chiefs had even started but it was putins angry speech afterwards that made clear just how personal this conflict might be he opined at length that ukraine was a colony with a puppet regime and had no right to exist it recalled putins essay bemoaning the collapse of the ussr and claiming russia and ukraine were one people hence denying ukrainians sovereignty and identity his speech this week also included the false claim that russian revolutionary vladimir lenin created ukraine praise for strongman joseph stalin and the fanciful charge that ukraine would seek to develop nuclear weapons in doing so putin resembled more a russian ultranationalist with a shaky grasp of history than a pragmatic master strategist a personal mission to rewrite history the charade could be dismissed as domestic posturing a president in absolute command appealing to the patriotic urges of a population wary of conflict but putin seems to regard it as his personal mission to rewrite the history of the end of the cold war this goes beyond concerns he may have about his legacy or a desire to deliver on his promise to restore russia to its former greatness this mission seems to be the real driver behind his aggression right now not the narrative about the continued threat of nato on russias borders read more putins invasion of ukraine attacks its distinct history and reveals his imperial instincts in fact his massive troop buildup on ukraines borders about of russias total combat power undercuts his perceived concerns over nato and a potential western invasion of russia this has required him to shift whole garrisons including from near the border with estonia and latvia both of which are nato members he has also decreed the russian military personnel in belarus will stay there indefinitely ensuring minsk also remains tightly bound to moscow this effectively adds new territory where putin can station military forces and even potentially nuclear weapons zurab kurtsikidzeepa putin has calculated the economic risks all of this indicates the conflict in ukraine is more about expanding russias territorial footprint than about the muchhyped nato threat in fact it is deliberately pushing closer to nato and this has implications for how putin is likely to calculate risk first putin knows nato will not fight for ukraine second he would have gamed out the potential costs of western sanctions and attempts to distract him with offramps to avoid conflict putins tactic of reducing gas supplies over the last six months encouraging eu members to deplete their reserves during winter is evidence his plan has been in the works for some time alberto pezzaliap so too has been his approach to diplomacy putins seeming willingness to negotiate over ukraine has clearly been a pretence given his refusal to budge on key issues and his swift discarding of the minsk agreements over the future status of the breakaway donetsk and luhansk regions third russia previously adapted to sanctions the west imposed after its invasion of crimea in by divesting from dollars into gold and building a large sovereign wealth fund this will provide some insulation from new sanctions imposed by western countries this week putin may well calculate he will be able to ride out even a tough us and eu package that already includes total blocks on russian banks germanys delayed certification of the nord stream gas pipeline and hints from the biden administration that tough export controls will be next read more putins public approval is soaring during the russiaukraine crisis but its unlikely to last how the west must respond if putin is undeterred by economic pressure what about political and military risks it makes little sense for him to stop at securing donetsk and luhansk as they stand today which is why he chose to recognise the far larger territory the separatists claim but dont yet control it also provides numerous opportunities for falseflag provocations since of the territory the separatists have claimed is currently held by the ukrainian military but it is doubtful whether putin would even see this as a victory for one thing he could have recognised donetsk and luhansk months if not years ago for another he did not need to surround ukraine with virtually every offensive military asset he has including mobile missile launchers tanks special forces and civilian control units just to secure the two small breakaway regions if ukraine is as personal for putin as he is signalling and his appetite for risk as high as his actions indicate the west must assume he has loftier ambitions than the fiveday war with georgia in that means taking decisive coercive steps in response to russias aggression at the very least the west will need a blisteringly tough sanctions package aimed at crippling the russian economy it will also need to arm ukraine and provide technical ontheground expertise and provide signals and other intelligence to the ukrainian armed forces providing this type of support will inevitably allow putin to claim the west pushed him into a broader war and plenty will believe him but all the signs indicate that is what he wanted anyway it is therefore vital for the sake of western credibility and for the ukrainians set to suffer once again from putins expansionist urges to ensure such behaviour does not come without significant

victory day parade monday on moscows red square watching as troops marched in formation and military hardware rolled past in a celebration of the soviet unions role in the defeat of nazi germany many

abandon its effort to storm kyiv over a month ago moscows forces have concentrated on capturing the donbas ukraines eastern industrial region but the fighting there has been a backandforth villagebyvillage slog and analysts had suggested putin might use his holiday speech to present the russian people with a victory amid discontent over the countrys heavy casualties and the punishing effects of western sanctions others suggested he might declare the fighting a war not just a special military operation and order a nationwide mobilization with a callup of reserves to replenish the depleted ranks for an extended conflict in the end he gave no signal as to where the war is headed or how he might intend to salvage it specifically he left unanswered the question of whether or how

the memory of those who fought in world war ii by doing everything so that the horror of a global war does not happen again instead he predicted russia would make a sluggish attempt to take control of the donbas including mariupol and a land corridor to the crimean peninsula which the kremlin seized from ukraine in arestovych said russia would drag out the war while bleeding the ukrainian economy with the aim of getting ukraine to agree to give up that territory russia has about battalion tactical groups in ukraine largely in the east and the south a slight increase over last week according to a senior us official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the pentagons assessment each unit has roughly troops according to the pentagon the official said that overall the russian effort in the donbas hasnt achieved any significant progress in recent days and continues to face stiff resistance from ukrainian forces russia is perhaps closest to a victory in mariupol the us official said roughly russian forces were around mariupol and the city was being pounded by airstrikes as many as ukrainian defenders were believed to be holding out at the steel plant the citys last stronghold of resistance the fall of mariupol would deprive ukraine of a vital port free up troops to fight elsewhere in the donbas and give the kremlin a badly needed success odesa too has increasingly been

3335,Beyond sanctions: 5 more ways New Zealand can help support Ukraine and punish Russia,the illegal russian invasion of ukraine has already seen new zealand break with long diplomatic tradition and introduce an autonomous sanctions regime outside the normal united nations process but as the war nears the onemonth mark there is more that can be done in particular the new zealand government needs to look at five potential ways it can support the ukrainian people and government and help international efforts to punish russian aggression offer nonlethal military assistance the new zealand government actively helped the governments of afghanistan and iraq to defend themselves but the current administration seems unwilling to do the same for ukraine despite the fact it is the victim of an illegal invasion by a superpower if new zealand doesnt wish to match the kind of lethal military aid its allies are providing it could certainly offer nonlethal military assistance body armour communications equipment nightvision technology rations medical packs and even cybersecurity tools it may be smallscale but the symbolism of helping the ukrainian defence matters the excuse that new zealand has no surplus kit is lamentable it should provide whatever it has now via australia which can deliver it and restock as required at this moment ukraine needs it more than new zealand does gettyimages control new zealanders wanting to fight both ukraine and russia are trying to internationalise the conflict by calling for foreign volunteers private contractors or mercenaries are also in high demand there will undoubtedly be new zealanders including current or former defence force personnel who are tempted to go while those with dual nationality new zealand and ukrainian or russian will have some legal standing in the conflict those without would risk execution if captured read more on the rd anniversary of the christchurch attack the ukraine crisis asks the west to rethink its definitions of terrorism current members of the new zealand military risk being charged with mutiny if they attempt to serve a foreign power while still in uniform fighting as a mercenary overseas is also illegal under new zealand law for new zealanders motivated by ideology rather than money the government also needs to be explicit about the difference between fighting on the ukrainian and russian sides one is acting like a terrorist organisation and volunteers should be treated as such much as new zealand treated those leaving to join isis open the door to refugees the million people who have already fled ukraine is an exodus of unprecedented speed and scale the government will need to extend its annual refugee quota currently and make some emergency decisions the recent approval of temporary sanctuary for around family members of ukrainians already in new zealand is an excellent start but the government needs to go further with a focus on actual refugees and commit to a number above the existing quota there is precedent to guide this not least because the origins of new zealands refugee policy lie in the same part of the world in new zealand accepted polish children and adults fleeing wartorn europe including deportation to the soviet union the present generation can do better at least double what was offered during the second world war prepare for russian vodka to become very expensive commendable as it is the new russian sanctions act which targets specific individuals and entities supporting the russian war effort is only a first step as part of wider economic pressure already being applied internationally new zealand can still allow trade in some russian products but use import duties to make them uncompetitive read more boycotting russian products might feel right but can individual consumers really make a difference a number of countries have already started down this road with the removal of russias most favoured nation trade status new zealand should be prepared to act similarly and expect russia to reply in kind against new zealand exports discourage antirussian hysteria despite calls by the parliamentary opposition new zealand should not unilaterally expel the russian ambassador such actions are normally a last resort when countries are actually at war or there has been extreme interference in the host nations sovereignty in the case of ukraine for now at least diplomacy has not run its course furthermore its highly likely such a step would result in the new zealand ambassador in moscow being made persona non grata in response new zealands multiple interests in russia would be left without official representation or support read more how will nzs law targeting sanctions against russia work and what are the risks at a domestic level the government should lead by example and not allow anger at putins aggression to harden into antirussian sentiment this means clearly identifying who and what should be subject to sanctions observing due process and acting as fairly as possible most russians with citizenship or links to new zealand will not be sanctions targets anyway many will be opposed to putins war ensuring

to renewable energy many of its industries particularly in germany had developed a debilitating dependence on cheap russian gas this revelation should be the first step toward a more realistic and less dogmatic european approach not only to its own energy transition but also to that in the global south the eu has an action plan for weaning itself off russian fossil fuels but while the details of repowereu are still being finalised it is already clear that like so many european solutions the plan is an exercise in muddling through exemplified by the fact that it will not be completed until though repowereu aims to accelerate the rollout of renewables and replace gas in heating and power generation it also depends significantly on the diversification of energy supplies already energy producers in the global south have received pleas to help meet the eus energy needs which has probably prompted more than a few eye rolls after all countries across the developing world have endured years of european proselytising about the importance of rapid progress toward a carbonfree energy system moving too rapidly to renewables if the eu cannot achieve this in the short term the global south most certainly cannot europe is worried that economic growth and local livelihoods will suffer if it attempts to move too rapidly to renewables developing economies are worried that they will have no path to sustained economic growth and poverty reduction at all they are right to worry the positive correlation between baseload power and prosperity clearly shows that a reliable energy supply is essential to economic progress but globally million people mostly in africa and asia lack access to electricity in subsaharan africa the pandemic worsened energy poverty with of the regions people now living without electricity compared to in given that future population growth and thus growth in energy demand will be concentrated in the global south this problem is set to get much worse and for now renewables cannot solve it because they do not represent a sufficiently reliable power supply a scaleup in hydrogen fuel could change this though this remains a stretch for emergingmarket and developing economies united states special presidential envoy for climate john kerry for one has now recognised the folly of attempting to force developing economies to go fully renewable on march

stop everything that we believed turned out to be wrong said one such analyst insisting on anonymity because he was at a loss over what to say i dont understand the motivations the goals or the possible results said another what is happening is very strange ksenia sobchak another television celebrity whose father was mayor of st petersburg and a s mentor to mr putin posted on instagram that from now on she would only believe in the worst possible scenarios about her countrys future days earlier she had praised mr putin as a grownup adequate politician compared to his ukrainian and american counterparts russian media had convinced its audience that us claims of an imminent invasion of ukraine were western propaganda aimed at depicting putin as a crazed warmonger this morning that audience woke up to find hes a crazed warmonger the unmistakable takeaway from the nyt story from the many russians it quotes is were no longer sure what hes capable of which on the one hand is encouraging if russians now view the tsar as a menace rather than a national hero that would seem to make a populist uprising more likely on the other hand were no longer sure what hes capable of isnt

secretary dmitry peskov in exchange ukraine would a guarantee of neutral status and the promise of no weapons on its territory per rt richard engel february that sounds like a demand for the finlandization of ukraine the ukrainian government wont agree im sure and putin must be sure as well possibly this olive branch is being extended in the knowledge that itll be rejected so that he can then claim that he sought peace before he launches the next stage of the attack but if engel is right its noteworthy that russia would theoretically allow zelenskys government to remain in place given

3282,Pence seeks to set himself apart from Trump by speaking out against Putin,by gabby orr and michael warren cnn the days of mike pence defending donald trumps controversial praise of russian president vladimir putin are over sources close to the former vice president told cnn days after pence condemned apologists for putin in reference to trump and other republicans who have made positive comments about the russian dictator amid his devastating invasion of ukraine the former vice presidents allies said he feels compelled to share his own longheld opinions on the matter which he refrained from doing publicly during his time as trumps secondincommand as pence prepares for a possible white house bid in the russian invasion has provided him with a new opportunity to distinguish himself from trump and underscore the foreign policy chops hes developed over two decades in government that separation is also coming at a time when pence is ramping up his political activities through his advancing american freedom group from raising money for republican candidates in the midterm elections and launching tv ads targeting vulnerable democrats to releasing a freedom agenda for conservatives to utilize in upcoming elections pence has been looking for opportunities to denounce what he perceives to be an alarming trend inside the gop of trumpaligned figures expressing adulation for the kremlin leader according to one person familiar with his thinking when you are vice president there is an obligation to support the presidents policies and when you disagree to share those disagreements in private now there isnt that same constraint so pence can be more vocal about his viewpoints this person said those around pence say his stepping out on ukraine reflects that the indiana republican has his own voice and a distinct political brand from the former president he served that was on display last week during his visit to the ukrainepoland border with samaritans purse an evangelical international relief agency run by franklin graham and his longstanding party loyalty gave pence a prime speaking spot at this months republican national committee donor retreat in new orleans where he plainly declared there is no room in this party for apologists for putin there is only room for champions of freedom then on wednesday pence again took aim at the russian leader in an interview with fox news saying that putin is fully responsible for the devastation and humanitarian crisis in ukraine there is one person to blame for this invasion its vladimir putin and putin must pay for the violence pence told the network shortly after ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky delivered a virtual address to members of congress though pence declined to mention trump by name in his new orleans appearance his sharp rebuke came on the heels of the former president calling putin savvy and genius as the russian leader launched a fullscale invasion of ukraine those comments have left trump isolated from other republican leaders including many of his own allies who have refused to echo his praise and instead unambiguously denounced putins actions i do not think anythings savvy or genius with putin house minority leader kevin mccarthy who has remained close to trump since the former president left office told reporters last week i think putin is evil he is a dictator and i think hes murdering people right now one person close to pence who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations said his team felt the donor retreat in early march presented the right opportunity for him to address trumps comments at a moment where the vast majority of republicans disagree with his take on putin this person said pence will continue to speak out against those who praise the russian leader within the gop to the extent that it continues to be an issue the nation has coalesced around the idea that putin is a thug that he is evil and that what he is doing is reprehensible this person said recent polling supports that assessment including a cnn poll in late february that found overwhelming support among americans for economic sanctions against russia including from of republicans a quinnipiac poll from the same time found that just of republicans have favorable views of putin its a smart move because the former president is completely out of step with the party and the country when it comes to putin and its one of the few issues everyone is willing to push away from trump on said david kochel a veteran republican strategist pence has his own voice although he has taken issue with trumps recent positive comments about putin pence has echoed the former presidents criticism of his successor in the same speech to gop donors pence accused president joe biden of squandering the deterrence that our administration put in place to keep putin and russia from even trying to redraw international boundaries by force and like trump the former vice president has called on the biden administration to sanction russian oil exports still pences recent comments mark a far cry from how he had typically weighed in as trumps running mate and vice president when he would comment on putin or russia for years as trump lavished praise on putin his fiercely loyal vice president would surface soon afterward to reframe trumps comments to make them more palatable for instance when trump said during a campaign appearance that putin had been a leader far more than thenpresident barack obama pence quickly insisted it wasnt an endorsement of the russian autocrat addressing the matter during his vice presidential debate against democratic sen tim kaine of virginia pence recast trumps comments as an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership of hillary clinton and barack obama while describing putin as small and bullying then when trump appeared to equate us actions with putins authoritarian regime during a fox interview early in his presidency pence assured americans that trump was not drawing a moral equivalency there are a lot of killers you think our countrys so innocent trump said during the interview in response to a question about why he respects putin even though the russian leader is a killer and when the thenpresident sided with putin over us intelligence officials during their joint news conference in helsinki finland suggesting at the time that he didnt see any reason why russia would have interfered in the us presidential election despite widespread evidence to the contrary pence rushed to defend the historic trip and lauded trumps commitment to put the prosperity and security of america first pence allies say he has always bristled at praise of putin inside the gop but is now in a place where he can share longheld opinions publicly without breaching decorum so far these allies said pence hasnt received any blowback for crossing trump on the putin matter and noted that he has been in regular contact with a range of foreign policy and national security experts as he decides how and when to weigh in on the ukrainerussia crisis mike pence does have his own voice his own opinions and his own views said one of the people close to the former vice president ukraine is not the first area where pence has sought to draw a contrast with trump at the top of the list are their divergent views of the insurrection at the us capitol on january and pences refusal to halt certification of the election in recent weeks pence has been increasingly vocal in defending his refusal to delay the counting of electoral votes as trump and some of his top allies pressured him to do speaking at the federalist society florida chapters conference near orlando last month pence called trumps efforts to challenge the results of the election unamerican and warned against conservatives who continue to insist that the vice president can alter an election he has periodically said that he and trump

2217,An uprising in Kherson,putins theory of how russia would pacify a conquered ukraine appears to have been that ukrainians would just sort of pacify themselves russia cant mount an effective longterm occupation of a country this large but it wouldnt need to provided that ukrainians placidly accepted their fate and welcomed their integration into russia its no exaggeration to say that russias entire war strategy rested on that dubious assumption bearing out if ukrainians resisted and forced russia to commit to a lengthy pacification effort theres no telling how long moscow would be able to sustain it especially with western sanctions taking a wrecking ball to their economy to put it another way putin really truly seems to have believed his own bullsht about ukrainians greeting russian troops as liberators in a worstcase scenario he may have imagined that ukrainians would resist initially but then would roll over once their cities were occupied and all hope of expelling the invader was lost that theory was tested today in the southern city of kherson the site of russias most significant victory to date the russian military seized it days ago and moved in to occupy it if putin is right that ukrainians will reconcile themselves to their fate once they fall under russian control the first evidence should emerge in kherson his theory looked shaky yesterday today it looks

numerous attempts to do so the ukrainians keep fending them off the convoy cant gas up so it cant move and meanwhile the russian troops who are part of it are running out of food telenkos assessment

they might murder him thats a comforting thought but i dont buy it he kept his distance from foreign leaders like macron and scholz too when they visited last month surely hes not worried about an assassination attempt by the president of france its more likely that putin resents the flattering coverage zelensky has received for his wartime leadership zelensky refused to leave kiev hes visited his troops in the field and hes frequently pictured side by side with his advisors hes a handson executive who consistently communicates solidarity with his people suffering alongside them putin is the opposite fantastically wealthy aloof from russian society and physically distanced even from his own aides todays photo op highlighting his proximity to russian flight attendants whose industry

8675,Members of the Global Left Turn out to Be 'Putin Stooges',one of the dumber talking points over the last month regarding the russian invasion of ukraine is the idea that masses of republicans are putin stooges doing his bidding with their rhetoric and policy positions polling has shown that to be a ridiculous contention with gop voters matching or outpacing democrats in regards to denouncing the russian dictators actions but as it turns out leftwingers across the globe have been doing putins bidding on a key topic that helped lead europe to its current crisis according to the sun russia spent millions of dollars trashing fracking as a way to make its oil and natural gas exports more lucrative on the world market how putin spent millions spreading fake news about fracking my latest article matt ridley march russian support for antifracking campaigns over the past decade took the form of public comments from the kremlins cronies a blizzard of scare stories on the russia today tv channel some overt political lobbying by the countrys gazprom and russian money almost certainly finding its way into the coffers of environmental pressure groups in gazprom a firm with a mixed environmental record claimed wrongly the production of shale gas is associated with significant environmental risks in particular the hazard of surface and underground water contamination with chemicals alexander medvedev the general director of gazprom export said fracking would never work in europe but just in case it did he added in a speech in brussels that the russian state was ready to wage its war on shale in just six months russia today ran scores of antishale stories with headlines like wrecking the earth fracking has grave radiation risks few talk about fracking fluid linked to fish dieoff us fracking wells annually produce bn gallons of toxic waste water destroying environment we say no to shale gas fracking nightmare fracking chemicals disrupt human hormone functions study claims living near fracking sites increases infant birth defects hundreds gather for antifracking march in manchester well isnt that interesting russia has long spread misinformation about fracking despite the fact that its a safer and far cleaner way to extract oil and gas than conventional drilling ie what russia does yet instead of accepting that reality the global left has helped spread putins propaganda which has emboldened and enriched russia while making europe energydependent on the controversial nation the entire crisis in ukraine and more broadly in europe was built off the back of dependence on russian energy if putin didnt have so many european nations over a barrel with the ability to crash their economies and cost lives by cutting off oil and gas supplies he never would have had the leverage to enter ukraine in the first place yet the greens so obsessed with pretending fracking is dangerous did putins dirty work for him effectively ending the practice in europe outside of the nordic countries you can also look at the united states as an example of this happening as well leftwingers in the states have spent over a decade insisting that fracking poisons water and causes fire to shoot out of faucets there is no actual evidence of that yet such claims have formed the backbone of democrat opposition to fracking an opposition that has reached the highest levels of government in the end nothing has empowered vladimir putin more than that so tell me again who are the putin stooges

1203,Even Tuckerâ€™s Lawyers Donâ€™t Think He Should Be Taken Seriously,as weve noted in our live coverage of russias declaration of war and subsequent fullscale military attack on ukraine in the last hours there is a schism growing in the republican party on whether vladimir putin is a mortal enemy or a brilliant friend the wildly divergent thinking within the gop has been on display repeatedly in recent days and weeks the hawkish more traditional wing to the extent it has survived the maga onslaught is today condemning putins actions and calling for tougher sanctions on russia the trump adherents are taking cues from their leader applauding the invasion and demonizing ukraine as some sort of failed democratic pet project of the united states all sides have a common straw man at which they direct their ire president biden with his administrations supposed foreign policy weakness but few have taken the trumpian affinity for putin as far as fox news host tucker carlson not even trump himself in the days leading up to putins declaration of war carlson downplayed russias weekslong campaign of aggression and threats toward ukraine as a mere border dispute while challenging viewers to dig deep within themselves and question why they hate the russian president so much it may be worth asking yourself since it is getting pretty serious what is this really about why do i hate putin so much he wondered tuesday night has putin ever called me a racist has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him he then went on to ask viewers whether putin was responsible for a litany of republican grievances has he pushed racial discrimination in public schools tried to snuff out christianity in the united states or eaten dogs i dont really have an origin point for this one all apparently in the hope of leading readers to the conclusion that the russian president who was in the process of starting the first land war in europe in decades was not a cause for concern the real enemy one might conclude was bidendemocratsthe radical leftprobably aoc these are fair questions and the answer to all of them is no vladimir putin didnt do any of that he said so why does permanent washington hate him so much even before last nights invasion some republicans in the vestiges of the gop establishment criticized carlsons trolly perspective on putin sen john cornyn rtx told politico last month that carlson is obviously not the right person to rely upon to address the matter in any serious way hes obviously not in a position of being responsible for those decisions cornyn told politico and we are it just so happens as washington post columnist margaret sullivan reminded us today carlsons own lawyers agree sullivan surfaced a crucial anecdote in her coverage of putins war today reminding readers that carlsons lawyers argued and a federal judge concurred in that carlson is hardly an arbiter of actual facts and that comments made on his highratings show should not be taken seriously sullivan us district court judge mary kay vyskocil echoed foxs own arguments in finding that carlson didnt commit slander when he accused a former playboy model karen mcdougal of extortion after the national enquirer bought her story of an affair with trump and then promptly shelved it on his behalf why not because vyskocil decided the whole tenor of carlsons show makes it clear to viewers that he is not stating actual facts about his topics whether the court frames mr carlsons statements as exaggeration nonliteral commentary or simply bloviating for his audience she

4174,Jozef Opdeweegh On Defending The Values Of Resolution,miami fl accesswire march when we think of the most common company values we oftentimes reflect on predictable standards such as integrity teamwork accountability innovation speed and fairness jozef opdeweegh a seasoned csuite executive and author echoes the predictability of the most common company values and phrases opdeweegh states that conveying and fostering employee and customercentric standards have come to typify modern organizations nevertheless opdeweegh recognizes a particular value that has resurfaced more recently in this world where countless points of view a shared and widely reflect the echo of political and moral adversaries make humanity aware of a word that has been conspicuously absent from every search he made regarding this topic resolve more particularly resolve when used as a noun rather than as a verb can refer to something of the opposite implying compromise or reconciliation of conflicting positions the distinction is not a bad thing in itself but one mustnt conflate the two meanings thankfully most recognize resolute people when encountering them just as they do in steadfast organizations or even nationstates advertisement indeed joef opdeweeghs idea of nationstates has rarely been more appropriate the newfound unity of the west in the face of russias evil invasion of ukraine has been described as a wakeup call for values reminding people of the criticality of the commitment to liberty freedom and the rule of law in many ways these principles are the societal equivalent to the company and organizational values that are now so commonplace and yet as recent events are showing they are nothing without the determination to see them through when tested often in jozef opdeweeghs career he has seen companies with wellformulated values seek their adjustmenttemporary or otherwisemost usually in the name of pragmatism or expedience he speaks on this idea and says i know from firsthand experience that the temptation to do so can be great especially when the markets or shareholders are exerting pressure he continues by saying ive learned too that sticking to your guns can be lonely and personally costly which is why periods of crisis carry the archetypal risk of seeking a resolution by abandoning our resolve advertisement jozef opdeweegh is not such an idealist as to deny that there may genuinely be occasions for pragmatism his hardwon observation is that compromising values typically amounts to shortterm convenience at significant longterm cost this is why great brands protect their quality and reputation above all else knowing that customer trust which takes years to build can be lost in an instant and its also why boards and governments have a special responsibility to live by the ethics they espouse guarding them jealously with a determination that can weather the inevitable economic and political storms in this respect resolve is like stamina to convictions without it one may appear fit for purpose but no sooner does the pace quicken and fatigue will begin to show to acquire resilience jozef opdeweegh believes someone must practice and persevere and must be committed to meeting the challenges they know will come and perhaps most of all one must be prepared for some pain in the process the alternative is that people are paper tigers deluded by posturing yet inwardly weak and ineffective the times we are living through are i believe a bellwether not only of all that we have stood for since the dawn of democracy but of our courage to defend those values when the prospect of a pragmatic alternative might appear more tempting opdeweegh says he continues on this thought by saying if we fail as nations as companies and individuals to take and bear the consequences of the actions that are necessary then we will pay a much greater price in the long runnot just in freedom or in economic dependency but in our dignity and ultimately our destiny too this is the critical role of resolve as a noun the point where steadfastness meets the sense of who someone is and who someone wants to be more than ever people need to find it not in google searches or company websites but deep in their dna for it applies to everyone not just those who lead but those whose frontline actions make a difference every day jozef opdeweegh ends his thoughts on this topic by saying the streets of ukraine are testament to this fact so too i hope will be the way we judge our leaders and those businesses we wish to work within future on that matter he is resolved contact andrew mitchell email phone source jozef opdeweegh view source version on accesswirecom

1345,US employs unusual intel strategy to counter Putin,the white house has aggressively worked to rebut false narratives emanating from russia about the crisis in ukraine by proactively releasing intelligence information a highly unusual strategy that experts and former officials say has knocked russian president vladimir putin off his game the tactic didnt prevent russia from invading ukraine but experts credit it with scrambling and defanging some of the russian plots to create a false justification for an invasion as well as preparing the world to react quickly it didnt deter them but it disrupted what they were doing and i think short circuited some of their plans said clint watts a fellow at the foreign policy research institute president biden credited this strategy in a speech from the white house on thursday making clear on the world stage that putin is the aggressor putin chose this war we have been transparent with the world we shared declassified intelligence about russias plans and cyber attacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or cover up he said vladimr bilk head of the european parliaments committee on foreign interference told the hill that the blunt and dire warnings from the us took away putins ability to benefit from the element of surprise this transparency this quick exposure and this intelligence sharing has been extremely useful because i think it has pointed to a number of weak points in russias strategy there has been little element of surprise in terms of whats to come he said the decision by the us to proactively share intelligence widely and publicly to rebut russian narratives represented a shift and desire on the part of the administration to take a bolder approach than obama administration officials in when russia invaded ukraines crimean peninsula we were hampered by our cautiousness regarding our sharing of intelligence said evelyn farkas who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for russia ukraine and eurasia under the obama administration at the time of the invasion still the worstcase scenario came to pass on wednesday night when russia launched a fullscale invasion of ukraine carrying out attack plans earlier published by the uk foreign ministry of defense that showed an extraordinary map with putins possible axis of invasion a phase one invasion from seven areas including belarus russia and occupied crimea for weeks for weeks we have been warning that this would happen and now its unfolding largely as we predicted biden said on thursday us officials and experts say that while the publication of putins plans has failed to deter him it has served to unite allies and partners to react in quick coordination and has primed domestic audiences to support imposing consequences this includes unity among the nation bloc of the european union which convened two meetings in quick succession to discuss and vote on sanctions packages against russia and putin personally for invading ukraine as well as moscows recognition as independent territories in ukraines donbas region germany also moved quickly to suspend a russiatogermany natural gas pipeline nord stream a serious point of contention between berlin and washington and other countries in europe im glad that germany finally came around and clearly stating nord stream is off the table bilk who is from slovakia and is a member of the group of the european peoples party christian democrats this is a project that cannot have a future at all a recent washington postabc news poll found percent of us adults support sanctions on russia though biden received negative marks overall for the way he has handled the crisis the right control of the narrative is important for setting the background against which governments will make decisions said daniel fried who served as us ambassador to poland and is a distinguished fellow with the atlantic council so high marks to the biden people theyre all in this is crisis mode all the senior officials are all in on this i dont think putin expected that while the us and its allies have been proactive in calling out putins falsehoods against ukraine on the world stage the russian leader has focused on his domestic audience airing grievances against the west to convince the russian people of a need to invade ukraine but protests inside russia have emerged over the past hours in some cities these demonstrations are a strong signal of outrage and pushback against putin among the russian public given the kremlins crackdown on free speech at least people were reportedly arrested if you actually get people turning out and they can be fairly assured that theyre going to be arrested i think is an incredibly informative signal to other russians watching that there are a lot of people out there who share your discontent about the regime andrea kendalltaylor director of the transatlantic security program with the center for a new american security said during a panel discussion so this can turn into a cascade effect still its unlikely to spur regime change in the nearterm given putins tight grip on power i think the most analytically objective answer is theres little prospect for instability inside russia she said putins control of russian media hampers the ability of the us and other countries to break through to russian audiences and the kremlin has sought to further restrict outside information from other sources russian officials on friday took moves to restrict facebook in an action the social media company said was retaliation for countering disinformation and as a tool for activists to organize protests ordinary russians are using meta platform incs apps to express themselves and organize for action we want them to continue to make their voices heard share whats happening and organize through facebook instagram whatsapp and messenger nick clegg facebook parent company metas vice president of global affairs wrote on twitter countering russian information operations both covert and overt will continue to challenge the biden administration as it seeks to maintain unity among allies partners and the global community in support of ukraine watts predicted that russia would look to find sympathetic audiences in european countries like supporters of farright politicians in france and the uk i think the first wave of disinformation is done already and were looking to see where they pivot next he said in the crosshairs is russian statebacked media outlets like rt and sputnik news the state departments bureau on identifying and combating disinformation campaigns the global engagement center described those outlets in a january report as critical elements in russias disinformation and propaganda ecosystem the british government on thursday accused rt of being a tool of kremlin disinformation and asked the uk media regulator to take appropriate action and review whether the channel is spreading disinformation a spokesperson for the prime ministers office told reuters senator chris coons ddel said he was personally struck by the scale of russian statebacked media on airwaves and social media while on a trip to europe this week he raised it as a challenge to keep allies united against kremlinsponsored propaganda and disinformation i was personally struck as i was trying to get information about the first stages of the russian invasion how much my social media feed while i was in eastern europe was just flooded with obviously russian crap of the most stunning quality but intentionality i do think that is a challenge he told the hill but he added that putins brazen aggression against ukraine and the efforts to call out russian disinformation and the kremlins attack plans have bolstered unity over other political differences i did not sense any significant disunity among the european leaders with whom we met coons said if anything national leaders with whom we had issues that were causing tension or distance we clearly were being brought together by the tension of this

which he blamed jews for bringing nonwhite immigrants and refugees to the united states in august a white supremacist killed people at an el paso texas walmart he referred to a hispanic invasion and the great replacement that twisted ideology is planting roots right here so as much we want might want to we cannot keep these tragedies at arms length there is a reason we keep urging lancaster county residents to strongly reject racist and antisemitic hatred replacement theory the white supremacist group patriot front is recruiting here and across pennsylvania walker reported in february ethnic purity is a requirement for membership in that group an interviewee must claim at least european ethnic lineage and be born within america to qualify a leaked document published by the leftleaning nonprofit news outlet unicorn riot revealed as walker reported unicorn riots analysis of applicants interview notes found that every member who was accepted including pennsylvania applicants stated there was an ethnic component to being american and that nationhood cannot be bestowed to those not of the founding stock in order to protect that founding stock patriot front has taken part in antiabortion marches presumably to encourage the births of more white infants the groups founder thomas rousseau said this in a speech at the university of texas at austin in america our nation stands before an existential threat a corrupt rootless global and tyrannical elite has usurped your democracy and turned it into a weapon first to enslave and then to replace you its utter nonsense of course but what happened in buffalo is heartrending terrible evidence that its deadly nonsense as national media have pointed out popular fox news host tucker carlson frequently has pushed the great replacement rhetoric so too have members of the republican party us rep scott perry of york county said this in april according to the york dispatch for many americans what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is what appears to them is were replacing nationalborn americans nativeborn americans to permanently transform the landscape of this very nation that is replacement theory some republicans have spoken out against it us rep liz cheney of wyoming put it plainly on twitter on monday the house gop leadership has enabled white nationalism white supremacy and antisemitism history has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse she is right it starts with words which are easily dismissed but must not be as walker reported for lnp lancasteronline sunday the antidefamation leagues pyramid of hate model argues that as biasmotivated language increases so will biasmotivated violence in the last few years we see that people are more emboldened to talk about their hate said andrew goretsky regional director for adl philadelphia i believe firmly one leads to the other we do too which is why we believe that whatever its source we must not let hateful language go unchallenged were not talking about shutting down a persons first amendment right to speech were talking about countering antisemitic and racist speech and conduct even when its uncomfortable to do so because its coming from a friend a coworker a neighbor or a relative likewise we must not dismiss or minimize the significance of what walker has reported as he noted sunday the antidefamation league recently released a report documenting more hateful propaganda in pennsylvania in than any other state adl assistant regional director santos ramos told walker that the organization favors legislation first introduced by state rep dan frankel dallegheny county in that would increase penalties and extend protections to the lgbtq community enhance reporting of incidents in schools and require offenders to participate in community service or educational classes in the current legislative session a version of that package is being sponsored by state senate minority leader jay costa dallegheny county it includes a provision to create a hate group database that could be used by law enforcement the prospects for these state reforms are dim which is a shame because an improved hate group database seems to us to be a critical need as walker reported the current database maintained by the pennsylvania state police appears to be marred by reporting discrepancies consequences for hatred as walker reported hate crime convictions remain rare even as hate crimes increase lancaster county district attorney heather adams told walker that obtaining a conviction requires sufficient evidence that the underlying crime was committed with malicious intent based on race color religion or national origin so lets take this seriously and speak out before crimes are committed lets make it difficult for hatemongers to feel at home in lancaster county we have no qualms at all for instance about the fact that proputin holocaust denier charles bausman who hosted a white supremacist gathering at his historic lancaster township barn in august withdrew his name last week from a zoning appeal of an affordable housing development at college ave in lancaster city his withdrawal came after lnp lancasteronline asked the other six residents involved in the appeal about his inclusion as lnp lancasteronlines tom lisi reported bausman owns a home on west chestnut street near the proposed college avenue development site though he still may be in russia where hes been living to avoid any legal repercussions of his illegal entrance into the us capitol during the jan insurrection bausman may be entitled as a lancaster city homeowner to participate in a zoning appeal but that doesnt mean he cannot be held accountable for his views kurt braddock a professor at american university who studies extremism and white supremacists told lisi i think one of the ways that people can demonstrate their displeasure would be to refuse money from somebody like this braddock said as lisi reported bausman contributed money for legal expenses related to the zoning appeal the remaining appellants ought to return that money or better donate it to a ukrainian charity or the antidefamation league because we agree with braddock that there ought to be repercussions for antisemitism and racism again no matter the

around the rest of the country in the past hours a senior us defense official told reporters on friday but the french government painted a less than rosy picture of the russian militarys progress the russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground particularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence french armed forces spokesperson pascal ianni told tv station france on friday it is possible that an attack on kyiv will be carried out in the next few days but actually taking control of kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long long time he said the russian army is also caught up in a premature spring he added with the defrosting ground causing mobility difficulties for the military britains ministry of defence said on friday that russian forces continued to make limited progress in advancing toward kyiv but could be preparing for a fresh attack against the ukrainian capital in the coming days it remains highly unlikely that russia has successfully achieved the objectives outlined in its preinvasion plan the ministry said in an intelligence update logistical issues that have hampered the russian advance persist as does strong ukrainian resistance fighting intensified to the northeast and east of the capital friday after the ukrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing russian tank column on thursday an overnight airstrike on the brovary district just east of the capital caused no casualties according to kyiv authorities ukrainian authorities also reported a missile strike on the town of baryshivka overnight into friday some miles east of the city a russian column that had been stalled for nearly two weeks outside kyiv has now dispersed according to maxar

5198,Moskva sinking: What really happened to the pride of Russia's fleet?,the russian guidedmissile cruiser moskva rests deep beneath the black sea this morning whether it lies there as the victim of ukrainian missiles russian incompetence bad luck or a combination of all three is unclear what is certain though is that the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in years will raise troubling questions not only for moscow but for military planners around the world what caused the sinking the ship sank off the coast of ukraine in the black sea on thursday russias defense ministry says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ships stored ammunition and the resulting explosions left the moskva with structural damage it says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port ukraine says it hit the moskva with antiship cruise missiles and that these sparked the fire that detonated the ammunition us and western defense officials seem to favor the ukrainian account the us believes with medium confidence that ukraines version of events is accurate a source familiar with the latest intelligence told cnn the moskva was armed with a range of antiship and antiaircraft missiles as well as torpedoes naval guns and missile defense systems meaning it would have had massive amounts of explosives aboard when was the last time a ship of this size was lost in war the argentine cruiser general belgrano was torpedoed and sunk by the british nuclearpowered submarine hms conqueror on may during the falkland islands war the general belgrano and the moskva were of similar size each about feet meters long and displacing tons though the crew of about aboard the general belgrano was more than double the size of the moskvas crew of about russia has not disclosed the number of casualties occurred during the moskvas fire and subsequent sinking a total of crew died when the general belgrano went down what does the loss of the moskva mean for the russian war effort the biggest effect may be on russian morale as the flagship of russias black sea fleet the moskva was one of its most visible assets in the ukraine war though moscow carefully manages news about the war in russia it will be hard to hide the sudden absence of such a large ship and its loss will raise doubts about russias warfighting abilities whether it was due to enemy action or accident both explanations for the sinking of the moskva indicate possible russian deficiencies either poor air defenses or incredibly lax safety procedures and damage control on the black sea fleets flagship analysts mason clark kateryna stepanenko and george barros at the institute for the study of war wrote in their daily war briefing carl schuster a former us navy captain said the doubts went all the way to the kremlin it raises questions about naval competence years after russian president vladimir putin announced he was going to restore the navys capabilities morale and professionalism schuster said it seems he has not been able to keep any of his promises for any of russias military services schuster said noting russia had suffered setbacks on land too but analysts are split on what impact the sinking will have on the russian invasion the isw analysts see it as a relatively minor blow saying the ship was mostly used for cruise missile strikes on ukrainian logistic centers and airfields russia has landbased systems and strike aircraft that can do the same thing they said however they added that if it was indeed a ukrainian missile that led to the sinking the russian navy would have to rethink its operations possibly moving ships farther from ukrainian territory and adjusting their air defenses in washington pentagon spokesman john kirby said the moskvas main mission was air defense for the russian forces in the black sea it will have an impact on that capability certainly in the near term kirby told reporters a lesson for china analysts say the sinking will be carefully studied in east asia especially if it is confirmed that ukrainian missiles struck the warship in particular analysts will be searching for any insight it might offer into any potential military conflict involving taiwan the democratically ruled island that beijings ruling communist party claims as part of its territory beijing has not ruled out the use of force to gain control of taiwan and this has caused tensions with the us which is committed to providing the island with defensive weapons timothy heath senior international defense researcher at the rand corp think tank said the strike on the moskva would underscore to both china and the us the vulnerability of surface ships in any potential military clash heath said in such a scenario the us navy would want to keep its surface ships well out of range of the antiship missiles beijing has amassed on the chinese mainland china on the other hand would be aware that taiwan had been acquiring inexpensive antiship missiles similar to those ukraine claims hit the moskva heath and others said because of that any potential chinese invasion of taiwan remains an extremely high risk mission heath said but some analysts said the moskvas sinking has limited relevance for the situation in east asia thomas shugart a former us navy submarine commander who is now an analyst at the center for a new american security said there were too many differences between the situations the moskvas air defense systems are not in the same league as the more modern aegis systems on us navy destroyers and ukrainian antiship missiles are not as good as chinese ones shugart said and sovietera warships like the moskva have been typically known for their offensive punch not for their defensive systems or their damage control shugart said more updates from ukraine,https://omaha.com/news/article_3231b8fe-91a1-51e4-820a-1041fccf5374.html,Neutral,1,the russian guidedmissile cruiser moskva rests deep beneath the

besides the quick path to citizenship russia has offered residents of the selfproclaimed donetsk and luhansk republics membership in the kremlins ruling party and other perks such as its covid

act on the request but signaled he wasnt inclined to support the idea which would violate a agreement about their status political analysts agree the kremlin is unlikely to back independence for donetsk and luhansk any time soon but will continue to reap political benefits from its involvement in eastern ukraine its a form of keeping the pressure on kyiv destabilizing it and hindering ukraines movement towards european values towards nato said moscowbased political analyst dmitry oreshkin advertisement putin signed a decree simplifying the procedure for obtaining russian citizenship for residents of donetsk and luhansk in april the day after volodymyr zelenskyys presidential victory was officially proclaimed since then more than residents of the rebelheld areas about of the population have received russian passports olga matvienko an official of the migration service in donetsk told the associated press the number of people applying for russian passports has increased in recent weeks as tensions around ukraine soared she said the procedure has been extremely simplified and takes just one to three months donetsk residents who have applied say having russian citizenship gives them a sense of protection from a powerful neighboring state relatives in russia tell us that putin wont abandon us and everything will be fine said yearold retiree nelya dzyuba many also say it will allow them to travel to russia and enjoy benefits russian citizens are entitled to such as free health care for that however a passport holder must go through additional red tape though putin last month tasked the government with making access to benefits easier ukrainian officials have charged that handing russian passports to residents of the rebelheld areas violates a peace deal for eastern ukraine brokered by france and germany a claim moscow denies the deal widely known as the minsk agreements put a stop to largescale hostilities but failed to bring about a political settlement of the conflict it envisioned donetsk and luhansk as part of ukraine but with broad autonomy from kyiv which has said that implementing the agreements would hurt ukraine the kremlin on the other hand has insisted the minsk deal is the only way to settle the conflict and has repeatedly accused ukraine of sabotaging its implementation kuleba the ukrainian foreign minister said last week that issuing russian passports to residents of rebelheld areas on a mass scale violates the minsk agreements in an interview with the ap oleksiy danilov the secretary of ukraines national security and defense council echoed his sentiment they have issued a crazy amount of russian passports he said adding that theyre involving these people in their political structure donetsk and luhansk residents with russian passports were allowed to vote in last years russian parliamentary elections and in the plebiscite on constitutional reform that permits putin to run for two additional terms they were bussed into the neighboring rostov region in russia to cast their ballots in december the kremlins ruling united russia party also accepted top officials of the selfproclaimed governments in donetsk and luhansk into its ranks along with some ordinary residents of the rebelheld areas analyst oreshkin also noted the political benefit to the kremlin saying it could potentially lead to almost a million additional votes for vladimir putin and his united russia party amid warnings that russia might invade ukraine some fear that moscow might use the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of russian citizens in donbas as a pretext for military action to defend them russian officials have repeatedly accused kyiv of plans to retake the rebelheld areas by force and have promised to respond if that happens commenting on the lawmakers appeal to putin to recognize the selfproclaimed republics state duma speaker vyacheslav volodin said tuesday that our citizens and compatriots living in donbas are in need of help and support mykola sunhurovskyi a military expert at the kyivbased razumkov center think tank said that russia could use defending the interests of russian citizens in donetsk and luhansk as pretext for starting the war sunhurovskyi noted that russia used a similar pretext in during its war with georgia after handing out russian passports to residents of the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia analyst oreshkin said however that the kremlin is much more interested in keeping the status of the rebelheld areas in limbo and showing that it has a number of options on the table be it recognizing their independence or deploying forces to protect russian citizens there there is no political interest so far rather there is political interest in scaremongering both in ukraine and its nato neighbors with such a rhetoric oreshkin said karmanau reported from kyiv ukraine ap reporters alexei alexandrov in donetsk

10768,Putin could be charged with the crime of aggression for the Ukraine war â€“ but itâ€™s an expensive process with high stakes,a yearold russian soldier pleaded guilty in a trial in kyiv on may for shooting a ukrainian man in the head after russia invaded ukraine in late february it marked the first trial of a russian soldier for the war in ukraine as allegations mount of russia committing war crimes a broad category under international law that includes targeting civilians during conflict ukraine is investigating more than potential war crimes involving more than russian soldiers and government officials but there is a large gap between trying an individual sergeant for war crimes and holding russian leaders themselves accountable for crimes committed during the war a lesserknown international crime called the crime of aggression could provide a pathway for prosecuting russian president vladimir putin this crime punishes the illegal invasion or use of force against another country only the leaders of the country that started a war can be held responsible for this crime philippe sands a wellknown international legal expert has called a crime of aggression case against putin a slam dunk this is because there is no legal justification for russia invading ukraine but this legal option is complicated and would likely require forming a new international tribunal a court set up to specifically investigate and charge people for violating international law and as an international lawyer i know the biggest challenge to holding putin accountable is not legal but political setting up a special court would require a large political commitment by countries across the globe to follow through on the charges and it would require a lot of money understanding crimes of aggression the crime of aggression formally known as crimes against the peace is generally defined as waging an aggressive war without legal justification this crime was first prosecuted at the postworld war ii nuremberg and tokyo tribunals which were established temporarily between and thirtyone german and japanese political and military leaders were convicted of these crimes including nazi deputy fuhrer rudolf hess there is little question among international lawyers that russias invasion of ukraine is an ongoing crime of aggression its an easier charge than other warrelated crimes to level at a national leader charging putin with war crimes would require substantial evidence like witness testimony or intercepted communications to prove that putin planned directed knew of or should have known of specific attacks against civilians the crime of aggression on the other hand is intended for heads of states like putin and their inner circle legal experts have drafted a model indictment against putin many legal observers believe that there would be enough evidence to find putin guilty of this crime and imprison him not a panacea since the s convictions no one has been prosecuted internationally for crimes of aggression one reason is that the international criminal court an independent international court based in the hague netherlands that investigates genocide and war crimes was not established until before then there was no clear place to prosecute this crime international lawyers also did not agree on an exact definition of crimes of aggression for the court until russia has not joined the court this means the court does not have legal power to independently prosecute putins invasion of ukraine the united nations security council could also refer this case to the court but as a permanent member of the security council with veto powers russia would block any attempted referral given the limits of the international criminal court in this case a number of legal experts are discussing other pathways a new court most international experts say that the best option is a new international tribunal separate from the international criminal court such tribunals are often set up with a narrow focus of war crimes from a particular conflict or atrocity they are usually established through the united nations that is because trials in national courts in ukraine or another country which recognizes the crime of aggression in their national laws face various legal and political barriers some experts also say that a domestic court lacks the legitimacy of an international trial another option is a hybrid both international and national court stemming from an agreement between the un and a country but legal restrictions in ukrainian law for example make this difficult because the countrys constitution has specific language that could block a hybrid or special court the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe a human rights organization that has european countries as members has called for a new international criminal tribunal which would be based in strasbourg france and would investigate and prosecute russian leaders for crimes of aggression the temporary tribunal would have the power to issue an alert to police worldwide to arrest putin or other russian leaders whom prosecutors are charging with crimes establishing a new court though would take time and a large amount of money while there are big differences in the various costs of international or hybrid tribunals prior court processes have cost between million to million per defendant international and hybrid courts such as those that were set up to address conflict in sierra leone are usually funded by wealthy countries like the united states and the united kingdom no end in sight as the ukraine war and reports of war crimes continue to unfold some experts warn against placing too much emphasis on any one kind of legal process for prosecuting putin ultimately the barriers to arresting putin in a foreign country and getting him into any foreign courtroom remain high putin is unlikely to leave russia and risk arrest and his tight control over russia at this point also makes it unlikely that he would be turned in by russian police although it is possible to hold a trial without a defendant present many human rights experts strongly object to this practice and one of the most substantial critiques of establishing a special tribunal for russias aggression is the challenge of selectivity why this situation gets investigated and prosecuted internationally and why others such as the us invasion of iraq do not but this is not a new challenge for international law and justice once set up an independent tribunal is beyond the political control of the countries that establish it to date no head of a state whose country is a permanent member of the un security council has been tried for the crime of aggression this would open an important new chapter in modern international justice that would follow a complicated uncertain course,https://theconversation.com/putin-could-be-charged-with-the-crime-of-aggression-for-the-ukraine-war-but-its-an-expensive-process-with-high-stakes-181928,Neutral,1,a yearold russian soldier

understand that theyve never been true masters of their own fate the fact that ukraines ambassador in london has been forced to backtrack on his previous comments made to the bbc that his country is

statesdespite kiev doubling down on nato membership russian foreign minister sergey lavrov noted on tuesday that nato had recently begun changing its positions and was taking russian security concerns more seriously than it has in yearswhile the issue of natos socalled open door membership policy remains russias primary concern lavrov noted other areas that nato has reacted more favorably including a moratorium on intermediaterange missiles in the region following washingtons destruction of the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty in that deal had dramatically reduced tensions by banning missiles with dangerously short flight times but the us withdrawal made it possible for us aegis ashore stations in romania and poland that washington had declared purely defensive could be refitted to fire strike missiles with ranges reaching deep inside russian territorylavrov also noted polands proposal to revive the informal dialogue on european security within the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce saying that such proposals show an understanding of existing issues as well as a willingness to deal with themposturing for posterityhowever nato isnt the same thing as

separated from them and forced to work on farms rather than return to the soviet union the reunited family immigrated to the us she married and moved to omaha in when her husband took a job with leo daly the architectural and engineering firm to her ukraines current troubles are part of a long history of russia trying to dominate the country which has good soil and warmwater black sea ports long coveted by russian leaders they need that good soil she said they need a place where they can grow food so they can feed themselves putin wants to rebuild the soviet union and it isnt just ukraine that he wants tyler white director of the university of nebraskalincolns national security program said that ukraine has long been subject to russian whims and has never gotten anything good out of the deal ukraine briefly independent after world war i was soon conquered by the new soviet union in the s the country was ravaged by the socalled holodomor a famine that started after stalin attempted to collectivize agriculture it led to million deaths at the dawn of the cold war the allies allowed ukrainians to immigrate to several countries including the united states blazauskas was when her family boarded a bus and crossed the missouri river on a july night she saw the lights of omaha for the first time for me as a child i looked and thought oh its christmas she said the

a church deacon he has a tattoo on his right forearm that says ukrainian pride the sad thing is we will fight for our independence again woloszyn said the sad thing is there is going to be a lot of innocent blood shed after the fall of the soviet union many congregants visited their relatives in ukraine for the first time lechnowsky first went back with his father in the s it was very emotional my dad was from a small village in the carpathian mountains he said they were still farming with thcentury equipment everything was horsedrawn or humanpowered no one had cars lechnowsky has been back several times family and friends in ukraine have now evacuated their children from the country or moved them as far west in ukraine as possible where its presumed to be safer more and more people are joining territorial defense units taking training on the weekends he said there have been dramatic increases in the purchase of firearms and ammunition i think there is a determination to defend their homes in the omaha church nearly everyone knows this fact after the breakup of the soviet union ukraine had the thirdlargest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world it gave them up the accord signed by the us russia ukraine and the united kingdom assured ukraine that its borders would be respected in the last of its nuclear weapons left the country its hard to imagine putin invading ukraine if the country still had those weapons unls white said in russian troops took control of the crimean region and annexed it since then violence between the ukrainian military and prorussian separatist forces has killed more than people that bloodshed appears to have served as a precursor for an allout russian invasion which began wednesday evening by thursday afternoon in omaha the invasion had killed dozens of ukrainian soldiers and wounded many more the russians appeared to be in control of the chernobyl nuclear site and had pushed into the ukrainian capital kyiv putin is planning this game to try to invigorate russia as an international power player he doesnt have a very strong hand at home this military adventurism is a very good way of distracting the people at home white said

9579,African refugees see racial bias as US welcomes Ukrainians,wilfred tebah doesnt begrudge the us for swiftly granting humanitarian protections to ukrainians escaping russias devastating invasion of their homeland but the yearold who fled cameroon during its ongoing conflict cant help but wonder what would happen if the millions fleeing that eastern europe nation were a different hue as the us prepares to welcome tens of thousands of ukrainians fleeing war the country continues to deport scores of african and caribbean refugees back to unstable and violent homelands where theyve faced rape torture arbitrary arrest and other abuses they do not care about a black man the columbus ohio resident said referring to us politicians the difference is really clear they know what is happening over there and they have decided to close their eyes and ears tebahs concerns echo protests against the swift expulsions of haitian refugees crossing the border this summer without a chance to seek asylum not to mention the frosty reception african and middle eastern refugees have faced in western europe compared with how those nations have enthusiastically embraced displaced ukrainians in march when president joe biden made a series of announcements welcoming ukrainian refugees granting temporary protected status to another already in the us and halting ukrainian deportations two democratic lawmakers seized on the moment to call for similar humanitarian considerations for haitians there is every reason to extend the same level of compassion us reps ayanna pressley of massachusetts and mondaire jones of new york wrote to the administration noting more than haitians have been deported despite continued instability after the assassination of haitis president and a powerful earthquake this summer cameroonian advocates have similarly ratcheted up their calls for humanitarian relief protesting in front of the washington residence of homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas and the offices of leading members of congress this month their calls come as hundreds of thousands in cameroon have been displaced in recent years by the countrys civil war between its frenchspeaking government and englishspeaking separatists attacks by the terrorist group boko haram and other regional conflicts the advocacy group human rights watch in a february report found many cameroonians deported from the us suffered persecution and human rights violations upon returning there tebah who is a leading member of the cameroon american council an advocacy group organizing protests this month said thats a fate he hopes to avoid hailing from the countrys englishspeaking northwest he said he was branded a separatist and apprehended by the government because of his activism as a college student tebah said he managed to escape as many cameroonians have by flying to latin america trekking overland to the usmexico border and petitioning for asylum in i will be held in prison tortured and even killed if i am deported he said im very scared as a human my life matters too the department of homeland security which oversees tps and other humanitarian programs declined to respond to the complaints of racism in american immigration policy it also declined to say whether it was weighing granting tps to cameroonians or other african nationals saying in a written statement only that it will continue to monitor conditions in various countries the agency noted however that it has recently issued tps designations for haiti somalia sudan and south sudan all african or caribbean nations as well as to more than afghans living in the us after the taliban takeover of that central asian nation haitians are among the largest and longesttenured beneficiaries of tps with more than currently on the status other tps countries include burma honduras nepal nicaragua syria venezuela and yemen and the majority of the nearly immigrants with temporary protected status hail from el salvador lisa parisio who helped launch catholics against racism in immigration argues the program could easily help protect millions more refugees fleeing danger but has historically been underused and overpoliticized tps which provides a work permit and staves off deportation for up to months doesnt have limits for how many countries or people can be placed on it said parisio who is the advocacy director for the catholic legal immigration network yet former president donald trump in his broader efforts to restrict immigration pared down tps allowing designations for liberia sierra leone and guinea in west africa to expire although programs like tps provide critical protections for vulnerable refugees they can also leave many in legal limbo for years without providing a pathway to citizenship said karla morales a yearold from el salvador who has been on tps nearly her whole life its absurd to consider years in this country temporary the university of massachusetts boston nursing student said we need validation that the work weve put in is appreciated and that our lives have value at least in the case of ukraine biden appears motivated by broader foreign policy goals in europe rather than racial bias suggests mara cristina garca a history professor at cornell university in ithaca new york focused on refugees and immigrants but tom wong founding director of the us immigration policy center at the university of california san diego said the racial disparities couldnt be clearer the us has responded without hesitation by extending humanitarian protections to predominately white and european refugees he said all the while predominately people of color from africa the middle east and asia continue to languish besides cameroon immigrant advocates also argue that congo and ethiopia should qualify for humanitarian relief because of their ongoing conflicts as should mauritania since slavery is still practiced there and they complain ukrainian asylum seekers are being exempted from asylum limits meant to prevent the spread of covid while those from other nations are being turned away black pain and black suffering do not get the same attention says sylvie bello founder of the dcbased cameroon american council the same antiblackness that permeates american life also permeates american immigration policy vera arnot a ukrainian in boston who is considering seeking tps says she didnt know much about the special status until the war started and wasnt aware of the concerns from immigrants of color but the berklee college of music sophomore hopes the relief can be extended to other deserving nations arnot says tps could help her seek an offcampus job with better pay so she doesnt have to rely on her familys support as most in ukraine have lost their jobs due to the war ukrainians as a people arent used to relying on others she said we want to work we dont want welfare for tebah who is staying with relatives in ohio tps would make it easier for him to open a bank account get a drivers license and seek better employment while he awaits a decision on his asylum case well continue to beg to plead tebah said we are in danger i want

7906,Ukraine Shows The World Why Gun Rights Are Human Rights,the world is captivated by ukraines resistance to russian invasion especially since much of ukraines resistance comes from ordinary citizens taking up arms in defense of their homeland ukraine has a fighting chance in part because it has taken dramatic steps to provide its people firearms more than automatic rifles and million rounds of ammunition have been distributed to volunteers in kyiv in the united states even supporters of draconian gun control are announcing they stand with the brave ukrainian people in their armed resistance the glaring contradiction between these positions supporting gun confiscation one day and gun distribution the next seemingly hasnt dawned on many of these ideologues their contradiction is apparent in actions as well as in words president joe bidens rush to arm ukrainians stands in contrast with his desire to disarm ordinary americans canadian prime minister justin trudeau is another prime example engaging in tyrannical gun control at home while supplying the ukrainian resistance with machine guns pistols carbines and million rounds of ammunition the european union shows a similar hostility to the selfdefense rights of its people even as it gives ukraine about half a billion dollars worth of lethal aid ukraine late to expand gun rights arming average citizens hasnt always been the ukrainian way either a report noted that the country had inherited the soviet civilian gun control system which provides for restrictive gun owner licensing and the registration of all firearms according to that report ukraine initially considered imposing comprehensive gun laws during the s but politicians gridlocked over whether or not private gun ownership would increase crime or improve security hopefully the events of have settled that question once and for all an individuals natural right of selfdefense applies equally to the defense of his life as to the defense of his nation and neither individual nor nation is secure without the ability to exercise it this should never have been a question as it happened ukraine was tragically late to expand legal protection of gun rights its parliament acted on an emergency basis just before russia invaded better late than never certainly but imagine if the people of kyiv had been training with these weapons their whole lives imagine if they knew them like the back of their hands instead of quickly learning to handle them during an invasion their resistance as well as their example to the world would be all the more powerful natural right to bear arms its also unfortunate that ukraines government has left some significant restrictions on the selfdefense rights of the ukrainian people and has only codified these rights in a statute rather than giving them full constitutional protection in reality the right to bear arms in public and private is a natural right that the ukrainian people need no government permission to exercise they just need the government to stay out of the way of their natural rights but in a time even many us jurisdictions violate that natural right its not surprising if other countries are confused about it ukraine is certainly moving in the right direction on gun rights something that cant be said of the entire united states the chairman of ukraines parliament ruslan stefanchuk says

530,DNC Lawyer Michael Sussmann Fires Back At Special Counsel Durham - Above the Law,on friday special counsel john durham filed a motion to inquire into potential conflicts of interest between attorney michael sussmann and his counsel at latham watkins its been five months since durham indicted sussmann a former perkins coie lawyer charged with one count of lying to james baker then the general counsel of the fbi in and yet it only just occurred to durham to mention this conflict now out of the goodness of his heart or perhaps not a person given to less charitable interpretation might think that he larded the motion with a bunch of irrelevant suggestive material then dropped it the weekend before the super bowl to allow the right wing media ecosphere time to spin the story into the next watergate before anyone else got around to debunking it durham says that rodney joffe sussmanns client who examined the dns traffic around politically sensitive entities in the way of the russian hack of the dnc exploited this arrangement by mining the white houses dns traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about donald trump by way of background joffes firm neustar was collecting bulk traffic data and noticed weird contacts between trump tower and russian servers and phones at the very moment russians had hacked the dnc were crawling all over our election infrastructure and seeding our social media feeds with antihillary memes he brought the data to sussmann who brought it to the fbi durham made further reference to a february meeting sussmann had with the cia during which he accused sussmann of telling the same lie he told baker ie that he was not there on behalf of a particular client when he was actually representing the clinton campaign when was trump inaugurated again immediately the right wing ecosphere went wild accusing clinton of paying joffe to spy on trump at the white house and in trump tower heres tucker carlson last night baselessly accusing the clinton campaign of stealing emails and text messages tucker the filing says they intercepted internet traffic that is emails presumably text messages pictwittercomvukcgmer acyn february by sunday trump was braying for executions in a stronger period of time in our country this crime would have been punishable by death in addition reparations should be paid to those in our country who have been damaged by this he howled literally none of that was true since joffe was the one who paid sussmann not the other way around and in fact joffe had legitimate access to the data all of which predated trumps inauguration heres a footnote from sussmanns response filed today for example although the special counsel implies that in mr sussmanns february meeting he provided agency with eop data from after mr trump took office the special counsel is well aware that the data provided to agency pertained only to the period of time before mr trump took office when barack obama was president furtherand contrary to the special counsels alleged theory that mr sussmann was acting in concert with the clinton campaignthe motion conveniently overlooks the fact that mr sussmanns meeting with agency happened well after the presidential election at a time when the clinton campaign had effectively ceased to exist unsurprisingly the motion also omits any mention of the fact that mr sussmann never billed the clinton campaign for the work associated with the february meeting nor could he have because there was no clinton campaign see dkt no at and the special counsel persists in alleging that mr sussmann billed the clinton campaign for his meeting with the fbi in september when that is false as well sussmann is now moving to strike language from durhams filing which is prejudicialand falseallegations that are irrelevant to his motion and to the charged offense and are plainly intended to politicize this case inflame media coverage and taint the jury pool these allegations were not included in the indictment these allegations postdate the single false statement that was charged in the indictment and these allegations were not necessary to identify any of the potential conflicts of interest with which the motion is putatively concerned sussman writes of the allegations about his conduct in february of why then include them the question answers itself noting that hes well aware of whatever conflicts the special counsel purports to be concerned about and has already waived them sussmann urges the court to strike the factual background portion of the special counsels motion pursuant to the courts inherent power to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process but whether or not us district judge christopher cooper agrees to sussmanns request he can hardly halt the spread of durhams false narrative about the clinton campaign because federal judges are powerful but they

government democracy is confronting a confluence of crises freedom house succinctly sums up the global situation as a lethal pandemic economic and physical insecurity and violent conflict ravaged the world democracys defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny it found the world is in the midst of the th consecutive year of democratic backsliding authoritarianism is on the march in a brazen example in the heart of europe the democratically elected government of ukraine is under threat by russia which has massed nearly troops along their common border from hungary to tanzania to turkey and beyond elected leaders are attacking civil society media and oversight institutions and spreading disinformation some governments have used the pandemic to deploy emergency powers that restrict civil liberties in addition citizen trust in government across democracies has plummeted the united states entered reliving the horror of the jan assault on its democracy this year elections across several major democracies brazil india the philippines among others will serve as a litmus test on whether leaders with authoritarian tendencies prevail but there are signs of hope and promise the end of saw major global forums such as the us summit for democracy and the global summit of the country open government partnership ogp convening a countervailing force to renew democracy and push back against the rise of authoritarianism a new study published by the organization i lead ogp assessed democratic reforms implemented over the past decade in scores of countries around the world it highlights hundreds of transformative efforts that are building citizen trust in democratic governance by making government more open and accountable specifically courageous reformers and activists over the past decade are advancing four broad categories of reforms that can protect and renew democracy going forward the first category opening opaque institutions to fight corruption today governments from argentina to ukraine are opening procurement contracts to end corrupt backroom deals at a time when the panama and pandora papers have unmasked illicit wealth stashed in anonymous corporations countries like armenia nigeria and the uk are opening up about who really owns the companies in another example colombia is empowering citizen auditors to monitor covid stimulus spending on a mobile app to ensure it reaches intended beneficiaries the second category empowering citizens to shape and oversee policies and services that affect their lives particularly at the local level such as participatory budgeting in madrid or citizens monitoring services in kaduna nigeria reformers are convening people across political divides in citizens assemblies to forge shared solutions on contentious policies such as samesex marriage in ireland or climate justice in france the third category empowering historically marginalized communities such as enhancing access to justice for the roma minority in north macedonia or empowering women by targeting the gender wage gap in jalisco mexico the fourth category confronting threats to democracy such as the netherlands and canada strengthening the transparency of online political campaigns to curb disinformation the imperative now is to scale up these reforms to tackle societal crises and reignite confidence in democracy as the most viable and potent form of government for addressing the needs of people the canadian writer margaret atwood noted the duality of democracy its great power to transform whole nations for the better and yet its own vulnerability and need for constant nurturing the fabric of democracy is always fragile everywhere because it depends on the will of citizens to protect it she wrote and when they become scared when it becomes dangerous for them to defend it it can go very quickly the mission of

769,Ukraine-Russia crisis: What to know in the escalating crisis,warsaw poland ap efforts by world leaders to head off a russian invasion of ukraine were dealt a serious blow monday when russian president vladimir putin signed decrees recognizing the independence of two separatist regions in eastern ukraine and ordered his military to maintain peace there but putins moves made as shelling continued in those regions could be a precursor to the kremlin sending in troops and weapons to support the separatists doing so is sure to deepen already inflamed tensions between russia and the west the un security council held a rare nighttime emergency meeting at the request of ukraine the us and other countries ukraines president volodymyr zelenskyy sought to project calm telling the country we are not afraid of anyone or anything we dont owe anyone anything and we wont give anything to anyone the white house said earlier monday that president joe biden had agreed in principle to meeting putin but only if the kremlin refrains from launching an assault on ukraine even before any invasion however both biden and the european union said they would move ahead with targeted sanctions in response to putins decrees the white house issued an executive order to prohibit americans from investing and doing business in the separatist regions a bidenputin meeting would offer some new hope of averting a russian invasion that us officials said appeared imminent as an estimated russian troops await putins orders to strike it was uncertain when or if troops massing at the border would enter ukraine here is a look at the latest developments in the security crisis in eastern europe putin decrees independence for separatist regions in a long ranting speech during a meeting of his security council putin charged that ukraine had inherited russias historic lands and after the soviet collapse was used by the west to contain russia putins decrees allow russia to sign treaties with the two separatist regions in the meantime they say russia will provide military assistance to maintain peace western officials fear that russia could invade ukraine any moment using skirmishes in eastern ukraine as a pretext for an attack the decision effectively shatters the minsk peace agreements which ended largescale fighting violence has still simmered and seen a spike in recent weeks in the wider crisis the meeting of putins security council followed televised statements by separatist leaders who pleaded with putin to recognize their regions as independent states and sign friendship treaties envisaging military aid to protect them from what they described as an ongoing ukrainian military offensive russias lower house made the same plea last week ukrainian authorities deny launching an offensive and accuse russia of provocation as shelling intensifies along the line of contact what happened at the un security council undersecretarygeneral rosemary dicarlo opened the session late monday with a warning that the risk of major conflict is real and needs to be prevented at all costs us ambassador linda thomasgreenfield said putin has put before the world a choice and it must not look away because history tells us that looking the other way in the face of such hostility will be a far more costly path russias un ambassador vassily nebenzia said putin acted in response to ukrainian aggression he said russia was open to diplomacy but wouldnt allow a new bloodbath in the donbas chinas un ambassador zhang jun called for restraint and a diplomatic solution to the crisis will biden and putin meet the us and russian presidents have tentatively agreed to meet in a lastditch diplomatic effort to stave off another invasion of ukraine russia seized crimea from ukraine in yet both seem cautious about a possible meeting the white house says the meeting will only happen if russia does not invade ukraine kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov for his part said its premature to talk about specific plans for a summit french president emmanuel macron sought to broker the possible meeting between biden and putin in a series of phone calls that dragged deep into sunday night macrons office said both leaders had accepted the principle of such a summit to be followed by a broader meeting involving other leaders too the white house said biden on monday conferred with macron and german chancellor olaf scholz during a minute call us secretary of state antony blinken and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov were to lay the groundwork for the summit at a meeting thursday according to macrons office blinken spoke with ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba after putins declaration and planned to meet with him on tuesday in washington the state department said whats the situation on ukraines eastern front heavy shelling has increased in recent days along the tense line of contact between ukrainian forces and the russianbacked separatist rebels in ukraines industrial heartland of donbas the conflict began after russias annexation of crimea and has claimed at least lives ukrainian military spokesman pavlo kovalchyuk said ukrainian positions were shelled times sunday and eight times early monday noting that the separatists were cynically firing from residential areas using civilians as shields he said ukrainian forces werent returning fire in the village of novognativka on the governmentcontrolled side yearold ekaterina evseeva said the shelling was worse than at the height of fighting its worse than she said her voice trembling we are on the edge of nervous breakdowns and there is nowhere to run russian troops stay in belarus adding to fears russian troops who have been carrying out military exercises in belarus which is located on ukraines northern border were supposed to go home when those war games ended sunday but now moscow and minsk say that the russian troops are staying indefinitely the continued deployment of the russian forces in belarus raised concerns that russia could send those troops to sweep down on the ukrainian capital kyiv a city of million less than a threehour drive rom the belarusian border ukraine projects calm despite bidens assertion that putin has made the decision to roll russian forces into ukraine ukrainian officials sought to project calm saying they werent seeing an invasion as imminent defense minister oleksii reznikov said monday that russia has amassed troops around ukraine including in belarus arguing that the number is insufficient for an offensive on the ukrainian capital the talk about an attack on kyiv from the belarusian side sounds ridiculous he said charging that russia is using the troops there to create fear over the weekend at the polish border many ukrainians were also returning home from shopping or working in the neighboring eu country some said they were not afraid and vowed to take up arms against russia in case of an assault eu offers to advise ukraine for all the posturing and vows of reprisal from western leaders direct military intervention has thus far been ruled out kuleba ukraines foreign minister said monday the european union has agreed to set up a military education advisory mission in his country kuleba told reporters in brussels after meeting with the blocs foreign ministers that an agreement had been reached in principle to roll out the advisory training military mission this is not combat forces he said this is a new element in the cooperation between ukraine and the european union the move could involve sending european officers to ukraines military schools to help educate its armed forces its likely to take several months to set up russia has sought promises from nato that it would never offer membership to ukraine and other former soviet republics a condition that the west has rejected the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff gen mark a milley spoke monday with the commander in chief of the ukrainian armed forces lt gen valery zaluzhny milley called ukraine a key partner to nato according to the pentagons summary of the phone call the latest british warnings british prime minister boris johnson said he was preparing to speak to zelenskyy and offer him the support of the united kingdom earlier britains defense secretary ben wallace urged putin to turn away from military action and pursue diplomacy not just for the sake of ukrainians but to prevent russian deaths russians know the consequences of the past actions including the invasion of afghanistan and russias invasion of chechnya he said these are just two examples when too many young men returned home in zinclined coffins and the government therefore urges president putin for the sake of his own people and even at this th hour to rule out the invasion of ukraine he said wallace told the house of commons that putin had continued to build up forces in the region russia has now massed of its land combat power on the ukrainian border he said uk foreign secretary liz truss said the west was preparing for the worstcase scenario adding we must make the cost for russia intolerably high

8840,Calling Ukraine â€œRelatively Civilizedâ€ Invokes a Racist Ranking of Europeanness,part of the series russias war on ukraine in an age of escalating imperial tensions cbs senior foreign correspondent charlie dagatas contrast of ukraine which he described as relatively civilized relatively european with iraq and afghanistan where conflict has been raging for decades went viral and offended millions around the globe this dangerous comment was a sobering reminder of the persisting racism islamophobia and colonial mentalities still propagated by mainstream media while people from the middle east expressed their shock and disappointment at being labeled uncivilized i want to focus on the relatively part of relatively civilized relatively european and illustrate the danger historical and lingering in concrete regional eastern european terms bulgaria provides an illuminating example of a country with inhumane policies for acceptance as fully european by a xenophobic islamophobic western europe since the end of the nearly five centuries of ottoman rule in a central component of building what we recognize today as modern bulgaria was coming to terms with being relatively civilized relatively european according to bulgarian intellectuals at the time of founding and socialism later the ottoman empire had interrupted bulgarian natural european cultural development thus cleansing all vestiges of islam and the ottoman empire was vital in affirming bulgarian national identity as a european country with modern european potential these ideas led to horrific consequences for the tangible living vestiges of the ottoman empire my turkish community bulgarian national identity construction during socialism was based on the turkish yoke historians and media framed the former ottoman rulers in classic orientalist terms muslim backward and barbaric hostile stereotypes were reproduced in many bulgarian television productions about the history of bulgarian plight under ottoman domination additionally the television productions were harnessed to legitimize a forced assimilation campaign that targeted muslim communities including my own every turkish and muslim person in bulgaria was forced to change their mostly arabicorigin name to a bulgarian one my mother still has the proof of her namechange document which she had to present at work to be given her salary practicing islam and associated clothing veils shalwar were banned speaking turkish was illegal and prime minister todor zhivkov declared there are no turks in bulgaria after the namechanging campaign was complete in the late th century in europe following my fathers escape to turkey and a lengthy ordeal with the government my mother managed to get my brother and i out of bulgaria shortly before the largest act of ethnic cleansing in europe since world war ii when turks were expelled from bulgaria in following bulgarias transition to democracy later that year ethnic minority rights were promised and restored and many expellees returned however as elsewhere despite a democratically elected government and european union eu membership ethnic minority rights leave much to be desired in bulgaria demonstrating how empty terms such as european are for example bulgarian authorities failure to tackle entrenched prejudice against asylum seekers migrants muslims and lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people is fuelling further violence and discrimination amnesty international notes leading to a climate of fear recently at the prospect of an onslaught of ukrainian refugees following the russian attack on ukraine bulgarian prime minister kiril petkov much like charlie dagata stated that no european country is afraid of the ukrainian refugees because ukrainians are intelligent educated and european in contrast to the prior syrian refugee waves of people with unclear pasts who could have been terrorists this empathy toward ukrainian refugees is indeed a stark contrast to bulgarian policies and practices toward syrian refugees during the syrian refugee waves instead of protecting syrian refugees bulgaria fortified its borders to keep syrian refugees out of the country though overt xenophobia is ostensibly against eu values a xenophobic islamophobic climate reverberated throughout bulgarian public discourse and as we witness again it is ongoing indeed this xenophobic climate is pervasive in the eu more broadly statements such as relatively civilized relatively european only fuel xenophobia and racism in countries described as such because elites aspire to full europeanness at all costs in our effort to combat xenophobia racism and islamophobia we must remember that terms such as civilized and european are nothing but a colonial fantasy peddled as human rights and justice for all edward said asserted that orientalism says more about our world than the orient itself the reactions to ukrainian refugees and characterizing countries in europe as relatively civilized does indeed continue to remind us that the scope institutions and influence of orientalism are still with us as they were when said wrote orientalism in the s yet i have witnessed the power of the media in toppling elite discourses and promoting intercultural understanding and remain hopeful for the future despite the herculean effort by bulgarian elites to instill animosity toward turks and turkey turkish tv series are adored by bulgarians and have been running on primetime television for more than a decade in bulgaria bulgarian viewers at first surprised that the turks in the tv series did not look like the turks in bulgarian productions increasingly recognized the cultural proximity between the two countries and saw turks for what they are human beings as a former refugee i can attest refugees are in fact human beings human beings seeking refuge from danger who would want to leave their place of birth comfort and community for an entirely new life unless they didnt absolutely have to a syrian refugee living in istanbul told me a few years ago that he wished that people would understand that war could happen anywhere today its us tomorrow it might be you he said this crystallized for europeans with russias attack on ukraine expressed with shock and open arms to ukrainian refugees this support for relatively european

6424,UKRAINE WAR: Putin's Latest Brilliant Masterstroke,russian strongman vladimir putin has removed several top military commanders from their positions due to poor performances in the ukraine war according to british intelligence officials on thursday the uk ministry of defense described a culture of coverups and scapegoating that might keep more russian officers distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for russias operational setbacks lt gen serhiy kisel who commanded russias elite st guards tank army has been suspended for his failure to capture ukraines secondlargest city kharkiv vice adm igor osipov who commanded russias black sea fleet has also likely been suspended following the sinking of the fleets flagship moskva in april gen valeriy gerasimov the russian militarys chief of the general staff likely remains in his post but it was unclear whether he retains the confidence of russian president vladimir putin according to the ministry the failure at kharkiv is telling russian troops never managed to take or even surround ukraines secondlargest city despite its proximity to the russian border and russias military logistics hub at belgorod over the last two weeks the ukraine army has pushed the russians almost fully out of the kharkiv oblast region in some locations all the way back to the border russia abandoned the battle of kyiv the capital of ukraine at the end of march soldiers removed from fighting there have been reinforcing the effort to take the rest of ukraines eastern donbas region according to multiple sources seven weeks later russia has yet to make much additional progress in donbas thats not to say everything is going swimmingly for ukraine earlier this week ukraine president volodymyr zelenskiyy described the conditions in the donbas as hell and said the industrialized and resourcerich region had been completely destroyed by the fighting down south after weeks of delays and heavy fighting russian forces appear to have almost entirely eliminated ukrainian resistance at the massive azovstal plant in mariupol the city along with the cashcow steel plant has been so badly destroyed that russia announced it will transform it from an industrial area to a resort town there are plenty of resort towns on the black sea massive steel plants are a bit harder to come by azovstal had employed more than people at the single facility and had been a big earner of foreign currency russia used to be a lot better at the whole spoils of war thing on monday retired russian army colonel mikhail khodaryonok warned on russian state television if you can believe that that things will get worse for russia he added russias position on the world stage is no better claiming the country is in full geopolitical isolation he also warned russia not to engage in conflict with finland which has recently announced plans to join nato much as we would hate to admit this virtually the entire world is against us khodaryonok said we shouldnt take information tranquilizers because sometimes information is spread about some moral or psychological breakdown of ukraines armed forces which are allegedly on the verge of some kind of crisis in morale khodaryonok said all of that to put mildly is false recommended is elon musk trying to buy twitter or humiliate it two days later perhaps after a gentle warning khodaryonok reversed course with almost comic effect when a country buys westernmade equipment sometimes it malfunctions or stops working right in the middle of the battle he said thursday on russias notoriously monitored state media our arms we supply to our buyers are different in their reliability you get exactly the weapons described alex ill take things no one said about russian vs western weapons ever for khodaryonok went on to say that the russian federation is yet to utilize even onetenth of its militaryeconomic potential russia is believed to have sent about of its combat power to ukraine and lost perhaps a quarter of it to combat fatigue and maintenance failures any replacements russia musters will likely be less welltrained and less wellequipped simply due to the stresses of war and the bite of sanctions whats the big picture though much less effective than advertised the russian armed forces can still cause a lot of death and destruction manpower and logistical limitations however prevent them from advancing very far or in more than one direction at a time the retreats from kyiv and kharkiv are the result of these very real limits the ukraine armed forces have fought beyond most expectations particularly in their ability to inflict damage on those parts of the russian military that can afford it the least retired australian army general mick ryan describes how ukraine has focused on russias communications networks logistic supply routes rear areas artillery and senior commanders in their command posts to devastating effect but ukraine has yet to demonstrate that it can force the russian troops out of areas where moscow chooses to remain strong thats a recipe for a long hard slog that benefits no one and risks escalation to a broader conflict i know i keep saying this but its time for the biden administration to stop yammering about regime change and pressing for the utter humiliation of russia and start working hard for a negotiated settlement but three

2038,Russia's nuclear threats over Ukraine are keeping StratCom busy,with russian rockets pounding ukrainian cities and president vladimir putin brandishing his plutonium saber you just know the latenight coffee is brewing deep inside us strategic commands glass tower at offutt air force base adm charles richard stratcoms commander and the keeper of the nations nuclear keys implied as much in videochat testimony to a house armed services subcommittee on tuesday due to the unfolding events over the weekend richard said i felt it prudent to remain at my headquarters here in omaha the russian invasion of ukraine is more than just the largest land war in europe since it also presents the united states with the starkest threat of nuclear conflict since the end of the cold war and has thrust nebraskabased stratcom into an unaccustomed spotlight the men and women of us strategic command work night and day to deter threats like these nebraska sen deb fischer said this week in a speech on the senate floor theres a reason their motto is peace is our profession putin has compounded the risk with barefanged threats sure to make neck hair stand on end in both omaha and dc todays russia remains one of the most powerful nuclear states putin said last week there should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country he ratcheted up tensions another notch sunday when he ordered russias forces put on a special regime of highalert combat during a strange meeting where he was photographed sitting at one end of a long conference table while his top military commanders gathered at the other so far the us hasnt responded in kind we know that the president has not placed us nuclear forces on high alert said lana obradovic director of the university of nebraska at omahas intelligence community center of academic excellence program but i am certain stratcom is observing the situation and working around the clock in stratcoms cubicles teams of military and civilian planners earn their pay by envisioning catastrophic threats to the us and its allies and then drawing up plans to defuse them this is the kind of stuff that they work on numerous reports written thousands and thousands of hours of research gaming out different scenarios that the president and his advisers could face said tyler white director of the national security program at the university of nebraskalincoln you dont want two nuclear powers going to war with each other the fear of just such a war animated stratcoms predecessor at offutt the strategic air command for four decades during the cold war as the us and the ussr eyed each other with a hostile gaze in those days nucleararmed missiles and bombers stood poised to fire in both countries around the world two generations grew up under the constant threat of nuclear annihilation the threat all but evaporated with the fall of the iron curtain and the breakup of the soviet union in sac the nations cold war guardian stood down and was replaced by stratcom the new command took on new tasks including space missile defense intelligence collection and communications but stratcoms public profile faded with the prominence of its signature nuclear mission suddenly with putins ukraine incursion americans are experiencing a riveting nucleartipped calamity that for many is a brandnew experience stratcom is one of the lesserthoughtabout military commands white said now it kind of takes center stage again because of this crisis the public may be paying attention to nuclear issues for the first time in a long while but stratcoms planners have never looked away the strategic deterrence mission is ongoing all the time said rick evans executive director of the university of nebraskas national strategic research institute an academic alliance that conducts research for stratcom these types of plans are very wellpracticed were very proficient at that evans has been in the room to see plenty of them the retired air force major general served in top positions at stratcom near the end of his year military career including a stint as acting deputy commander he retired in evans said he would be more worried about putins nuclear noisemaking if stratcoms intelligence sources indicated he was taking concrete steps toward a nuclear strike like loading bombs on aircraft or pulling weapons out of storage this is still a regional conflict he said we have the appropriate forces on status at the right time people may think stratcoms strategic plans rest on massive retaliation nuking adversaries to kingdom come and they do have plans for armageddon but armageddon represents the failure of nuclear deterrence evans said stratcoms modern plans employ nonnuclear and even nonmilitary strategies to keep confrontations from escalating like diplomacy information warfare and economic sanctions all these instruments of national power are in play he said and all of them are in use in ukraine including by ukrainians themselves militarily they should be no match for the huge russian army but president volodymyr zelenskyy has united his own people behind him and inspired nato and the world to support his cause he has won the information war white said this is a space that putin is used to winning and he is being absolutely schooled the sympathy for zelenskyy and his fellow ukrainians has aided president joe bidens efforts to rally nato support nato has certainly demonstrated that it is more united resilient and resolute than ever before said obradovic the unintended consequence of the russian aggression was that american leadership and natos renewed purpose have now led to an increase in defense spending and added credibility obradovic an associate professor of political science who has worked closely with stratcom brings a unique personal perspective to a research portfolio that includes us national security policymaking and postcommunist transitions at age she fled her home in the former yugoslavia with her mother as the country was engulfed in sectarian violence following the collapse of communist rule she has witnessed the kind of indiscriminate targeting of civilians now taking place in ukraine and experienced life as a refugee coincidentally obradovic is on a sabbatical in sarajevo in her former homeland recruiting young bosnian students for a summer program at uno in the s sarajevo became the battered symbol of the bosnian war during a fouryear siege that killed nearly people sarajevens have marched in support of the ukrainian people obradovic said and feel a special bond to them in their suffering they know a lot about war perseverance and defiance which is why so many are horrified by the events in ukraine she said in an email the hope is that the world has learned its lessons since bosnia that democratic nations will protect international norms and rules and prevent atrocities and attacks particularly those aimed at the civilian population from happening again putin has certainly endured setbacks with his military bogged down in ukraine the world nearly united in its disapproval international sanctions already crippling russias economy and protesters marching in the streets of his own country ukraines efforts to frustrate the invasion have surpassed expectations white said he has to feel isolated internationally and he probably feels isolated internally his biggest fear is a popular uprising the growing fear is that feeling cornered putin might unsheathe his nuclear sword would he really do it thats an important question that energizes everybodys minds said christopher yeaw nsris associate executive director for strategic deterrence and nuclear programs in putins current state of mind he is certainly leaning forward in the nuclear realm yeaw said putin has a large number of lowyield tactical or battlefield atomic weapons these are small enough to level a few city blocks perhaps killing dozens or hundreds of people instead of destroying an entire city and killing tens of thousands of course they would still burn and maim and poison just on a smaller scale these are nuclear warheads that blur the line between conventional and nuclear yeaw said they could take out an entire air base with one strike the us and the ussr both stored up large caches of these baby nukes during the cold war expecting they might use them should the two sides clash in a european ground war battlefield nuclear weapons werent covered by any of the postcold war arms agreements the us got rid of its weapons seeing no further need for them for a time russia did too yeaw said but by the s it stopped after seeing the us become involved in conflicts with russian allies in the balkans the russians made promises that went away yeaw said the us is outmatched in the european theater probably to in the pacific theater we dont have any yeaw helped to write the pentagons nuclear posture review which provided for the addition of two new types of tactical nuclear weapons in the us arsenal the w trident submarine warhead which was deployed in and the sealaunched cruise missile which is still on the drawing board the w is about to kilotons less than as powerful as the w trident missile it is derived from and less than half the strength of the bomb that leveled hiroshima japan at the end of world war ii battlefield nuclear weapons are opposed by armscontrol advocates who believe their lesser firepower compared with larger citykilling weapons might tempt a cornered desperate leader to use them doing so would clearly cross a red line any use of nuclear weapons is going to have strategic implications evans said if you actually use one of these things if you break the seal it opens you up to a whole different variety of outcomes so would putin really use one thats the million question yeaw said the united states is trying to stay out of a direct confrontation with russia its not clear how biden would respond if putin detonates a battlefield nuke in ukraine how do you deal with a country that is willing to use nuclear weapons in a war that youre not in white said its hard to believe theres going to be no response part of yeaws job since joining nsri is to prepare war games for stratcom planners to play simulating reallife situations in his team created one and blandly named it the limited nuclear employment war game it plays out a conflict between nato and russia over russian expansionism in ukraine he has played it a number of times so have planners at stratcom yeaw doesnt want to say exactly how it ends what could happen is the whole realm of scary possibilities he said once you start down the path of war things take on a life of their own hes been thinking about that game in recent weeks i hope i dont watch it on tv yeaw said one of the key points in any stratcom plan to avert war is to give the adversary a facesaving way to back out said michelle black deterrence researcher and assistant professor of political science at nsri she too has been in the room her tour in the army from included deployments to iraq kuwait and qatar as a psychological operations specialist she worked seven years at stratcom in a civilian post as an adversary deterrence analyst she worked there when putin seized crimea in since crimea ukraine has been a target of attention understanding how things could escalate has been a priority black said i would have confidence in saying that a portion of this has been planned out she sees putin as a rational actor putins a strategist he has smart people around him she said maybe putins not ready for an offramp yet yeaws concern is what happens if nato corners putin so effectively that the offramps are gone theres a cornered bear thats still trying to lash out yeaw said i wouldnt want to be in front of the bears paw in his testimony this week stratcoms adm richard worked to reassure jittery members of congress please make no mistake he said stratcoms forces are ready photos offutt air force base through the

8893,Britain bans Russian state TV channel RT, cnn by mark thompson cnn business britain has banned russian state tv channel rt saying it was incapable of providing impartial coverage of the war in ukraine uk broadcast media regulator ofcom said it had been conducting investigations into rts coverage of russias invasion and had taken into account the channels ties with the russian state and new russian laws which effectively criminalize any journalism that departs from the kremlins narrative in relation to the war freedom of expression is something we guard fiercely in this country and the bar for action on broadcasters is rightly set very high ofcom ceo melanie dawes said in a statement following an independent regulatory process we have today found that rt is not fit and proper to hold a license in the uk as a result we have revoked rts uk broadcasting license the european union had already banned rt from broadcasting as part of sweeping sanctions imposed on moscow in response to the invasion of ukraine the measure suspended rts broadcasting activities in the european union or directed at it affecting its uk german french and spanish networks ofcom confirmed in its statement friday that the channel was already off air in the united kingdom because of the eu sanctions the kremlin described britains move as antirussian madness this is a continuation of the antirussian madness that is happening in europe and the us kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov told reporters this is another step to grossly restrict freedom of speech to violate all laws related to the work of the media he added rts ability to project president vladimir putins talking points around the world has been significantly constrained in recent weeks as cable carriers and social media channels dumped the broadcaster directv one of only two major television providers in the united states to carry rt said earlier this month it was cutting ties with immediate effect a few days later

7088,Blinken says Russiaâ€™s â€˜playbookâ€™ for an invasion of Ukraine is moving forward but war can still be averted,by jeremy herb cnn secretary of state antony blinken said sunday that russias playbook for an invasion of ukraine is moving forward though he said there still is a chance for diplomacy to avert a war as weve described it everything leading up to the actual invasion appears to be taking place blinken said on cnns state of the union on sunday ukraines defense ministry reported more than ceasefire violations in eastern ukraine on saturday and said that shelling continued into sunday while russian troops remain in belarus to continue military exercises that were supposed to have concluded blinken told cnns dana bash he was concerned that the extension of the exercises was another sign that russia was setting the stage to invade following falseflag operations this week and the accumulation of more than russian forces along ukraines border now theyre justifying the continuation of exercises that they said would end now the continuation indefinitely of those quoteunquote exercises on the situation in eastern ukraine a situation that they created by continuing to ramp up tensions blinken said still blinken said the us would continue to try to find a lastditch diplomatic path he said president joe biden is willing to talk to russian president vladimir putin at any time in any format if it will help prevent a war saying the biden administration will continue to take whatever steps it can to try to convince moscow not to invade ukraine we believe president putin has made the decision but until the tanks are actually rolling and the planes are flying we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade president putin from carrying this forward blinken said ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky was in germany on saturday where he met with vice president kamala harris at the munich security conference zelensky said that he was urging the us and europe not to wait to put in place sanctions against russia arguing that they wouldnt help ukraine if they only were invoked after an invasion had already begun blinken said on sunday that the us did not want to unveil the sanctions ahead of time because that would allow russia to try and plan against them the purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter russia from going to war he said as soon as you trigger them that deterrent is gone and until the last minute as long as we can try to bring a deterrent effect to this were going to try to do that blinken said that if putin goes forward with an invasion the us and nato have been clear theyre going to come down on him and russia very very hard asked if putin could be bluffing blinken said theres always a chance but every indication that weve seen every move that hes made that has followed the play that we laid out for the world to see in front of the united nations security council he is following the script almost to the letter everything were seeing suggests that this is dead serious that we are on the brink of an invasion he added but putin still has options on the table if he chooses to take a diplomatic offramp to the tensions pentagon press secretary john kirby said sunday we have made serious proposals and talked about changing for instance the scope and scale of some of our exercises in europe being willing to talk about offensive missile capabilities in europe we have certainly put forward other proposals to try to convince mr putin that were serious kirby told fox he also made clear the issue of ukraines membership in nato however is an issue for ukraine and for nato that is not something that mr putin can simply institute a veto over or decide for himself he said and the us would not recognize the ceding of crimea or any other territory in eastern ukraine to russia as a way to avoid war blinken told cbs margaret brennan sunday no the secretary said when asked on face the nation if the us would use that tactic as a diplomatic way to avoid a larger war meanwhile president sauli niinist of finland which shares a border with russia told bash in a separate interview sunday that putin has behaved in a way which is very difficult to predict its very difficult to say and define what the other person actually deep down is but so far i would say that he has behaved in a way which is very difficult to predict but that might be also intentional namely to behave in that way because that brings confusion to surroundings niinist said blinken is scheduled to meet later this week with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov in europe in what would be another round of diplomatic talks that have gone on for weeks as russias troops have continue to mass on ukraines border but blinken said the meeting would be called off in the event of an invasion it all depends on what russia does in the coming days he said if it

3573,Russia: Now witness the firepower of this fully ARMED and OPERATIONAL hypersonic missile system,is vladimir putin literally breaking out the big guns in an effort to finally destroy the resistance in ukraine that seems to be the implication if an announcement from the russian army is to be believed while not technically the biggest guns they have in their arsenal one of russias generals claimed that they used one of their new kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles to destroy an underground ammunition depot near the polish border this morning weve long since passed the point where you can take any statements made by russian officials at face value but we do know that moscow has successfully tested their hypersonic weapons before this would be the first use of such a missile in actual combat however nbc news russias military said saturday it had used a hypersonic missile in combat for the first time to destroy an ammunition depot in ukraines west maj gen igor konashenkov said the kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles was deployed friday in a video posted on russian state media rias telegram channel he added that it destroyed a large underground warehouse containing missiles and aviation ammunition in the village of delyatyn a small community around miles west of ukraines capital kyiv nbc news was not able to verify his claims which came after ukraines president volodymyr zelenskyy called for talks with moscow to stop its invasion and restore territorial integrity and justice to ukraine in a video message released late friday as noted in the article nbc was unable to verify that an ammunition depot had actually been destroyed and if so a hypersonic missile was used to do it i would imagine that american intelligence officials have been watching the action closely via satellite surveillance systems and they should be able to confirm or deny the story soon enough would russia lie about something like this thats probably a silly question at this point theyve been lying through their teeth about almost every aspect of the invasion of ukraine since well before it even began but the use of these advanced weapons systems or even the threat of using them might be putins way of trying to intimidate the ukrainian resistance if so that might be some sort of compromise measure in terms of a question that we looked at here recently some analysts have grown concerned that putin might deploy a tactical nuclear weapon if he grows too frustrated with his lack of progress in sacking ukraine perhaps thats still a bridge too far but hes thinking that the new hypersonic missiles might send the same message in any event mad vlad has more bad news to be frustrated by as of this morning ukraine is claiming to have killed another russian general in combat russian lieutenantgeneral andrei mordvichev was killed during fighting ukraines armed forces said saturday in a statement on its facebook page it said mordvichev the commander of the th allmilitary army of the southern military district of the armed forces was killed as a result of fire damage that headline hasnt been confirmed yet either and ukraine has been known to pad some of their numbers to emphasize the effectiveness of their resistance but if it turns out to be true russia has lost something in the range of a halfdozen of their most senior military officers in less than a month thats a really curious development because the top brass tends to command from the rear in most war scenarios so either they have advanced too quickly without clearing the resistance and allowed the ukrainians to get behind them in force or their soldiers are so disorganized and bad at this that the generals feel compelled to go to the front lines and direct the action themselves either way its not a positive development for the vaunted russian

2867,Russia's top oligarch to Putin: Never go the full Maduro ... or Lenin,a gutsy move by russias wealthiest oligarch who probably should make sure all of his upperstory windows are solidly reinforced after this the first signs of a public split between vladimir putin and his bigmoney support edged out into the open today yesterday the russian tyrant threatened massive expropriations for western firms that bail out of russia over the invasion of ukraine a move that comes straight out of russias communist past president vladimir putin had promised a response speaking thursday at a meeting with government officials he backed a plan to introduce external management of foreign companies leaving russia we need to act decisively with those companies who are going to close their production putin said according to a video posted by the kremlin and aired on state media it is necessary then to introduce external management and then transfer these enterprises to those who want to work he added russian prime minister mikhail mishustin said earlier that legislation had been drafted if foreign owners close the company unreasonably then in such cases the government proposes to introduce external administration depending on the decision of the owner it will determine the future fate of the enterprise mishustin said according to the kremlin external management means outright seizure through expropriation socialist regimes almost always play this card when industrial owners refuse to play ball with their collectivist policies if not immediately at the start of la revolucion hugo chavez and nicolas maduro used expropriation in venezuela in the oil industry which had been at one time the backbone of prosperity in the country after kicking out the oil companies and seizing their assets the normal hayekian sequence rapidly followed as it did in other industries where expropriations took place in fact the soviet union did the same thing in with disastrous effect as jim geraghty reminds us today our study shows that until the year of the revolution russias economy was declining but by no more than any other continental power while wartime economic trends shed some light on the causes of the russian revolution they certainly do not support an economically deterministic story if anything our account leaves more room for political agency than previous studies in the two years following the revolution there was an economic catastrophe by average incomes in soviet russia had fallen to less than international dollars at prices less than half that of this level is experienced today only in the very poorest countries of the world and had not been seen in eastern europe since the th century maddison worse was to come after a run of disastrous harvests famine conditions began to appear in the summer of in some regions perhaps as early as in petrograd in the spring of an average workers daily intake was below calories about half the level before the war spreading hunger coincided with a wave of deaths from typhus typhoid dysentery and cholera in the grain harvest collapsed further particularly in the southern and eastern grainfarming regions more than five million people may have died prematurely at this time from hunger and disease that brings us to vladimir potanin russias wealthiest oligarch with over billion in assets even after the sanctions collapsed russias stock market and ruble potanin warned that putins plan to expropriate these assets would preclude any return of western capital to russia for a generation a fate that potanin doesnt think is necessarily set pursuing this path would bring russia all the way back to lenin and potanin warns that russians wont stand for that firstly it would take us back a hundred years to and the consequences of such a step global distrust of russia on the part of investors we would experience for many decades he said in a message posted on norilsk nickels telegram account on thursday secondly the decision of many companies to suspend operations in russia is i would say somewhat emotional in nature and may have been taken as a result of unprecedented pressure on them from public opinion abroad so most likely they will come back and personally i would keep such an opportunity for them he added potanin said it wasnt particularly expedient to talk about nationalizing western assets but the kremlins proposal could allow owners to keep property and companies to avoid collapse continue to produce products and pay money to employees i understand that in light of the economic restrictions directed against russia there may be an understandable desire to act symmetrically he wrote but on the example of western countries we see that the economies of these countries suffer from the imposition of sanctions against russia we must be wiser and avoid a scenario where retaliatory sanctions hit ourselves thats a gentle nudge toward putin to consider the backfire potential longterm of his consequences if putin still needs to be reminded of that necessity after watching his ukraine adventure blow up in his face it seems doubtful that putin will be encouraged to moderate his economic response to the financial lockout from the west putin justifies his power by acting muscularly not intellectually an impulse that likely has increased in putin the more it becomes apparent that his military is actually a paper tiger when it comes to conventional forces that makes this rare dissent from the ruling oligarchical class especially dangerous to potanin it might be even more dangerous to putin however it looks as though he might have exhausted his support from the oligarchical class whose corruption has deep tentacles in putins government putins not the only dangerous man at that level in russia and the question may arise as to whether the oligarchs might start looking for another option if putin keeps making matters worse potanin had better watch his back but maybe putin should start worrying too especially when potanin seems to feel comfortable enough to publicly rebuke tsar

1773,"The Armies of the Right, by Aris Roussinos",adjust share outside the citycouncil offices in kyivs obolon district andriy biletsky was about to give a speech it was a spring day in and volunteers from biletskys farright group the azov movement were idling in the sunshine next to the gloomy sovietera building while others milled about in the shade of the birch and linden trees of a nearby park almost outnumbering the audience members the volunteers wore tightfitting tshirts and heavy military boots and were ready to record the proceedings with cell phones and camcorders the spectators mostly pensioners clutched plastic shopping bags and gossiped among themselves azov was established in as a volunteer militia and was lauded for its heroic intervention in ukraines grueling campaign against russianbacked separatists in the east since those early victories however azov has expanded its scope managing to integrate itself into the military the police and other structures of the ukrainian state it established its own political party the national corps biletsky who commanded azovs military forces against russia is the partys leader there was a flurry of activity gray heads turning and phones held aloft as biletskya burly fortyyearold sporting a neatly groomed beard and a tight fadeentered the scene a small crowd of babushkas with hennadyed hair and young people in combat gear clustered around him as he began to speak he railed against the traitors and crooks who dominate ukrainian politics and boasted of azovs efforts to offer it and english lessons to the elderly and unemployed the crowd applauded im so glad you are here cried one old woman when biletsky opened the floor for questions everyone says the nationalists are nazis but really you are patriots the audience applauded again as biletskys tattooed blackclad entourage scanned the crowd for potential hecklers one respectably dressed middleaged man carrying groceries asked biletsky why he hadnt deployed his regiment to deal with the crooks in parliament biletsky sidestepped the question reminding the crowd instead of the importance of voting when the q and a ended i pushed myself forward and managed to shake biletskys hand i reminded him that we had an interview scheduled for the next day what do you want to ask me about he said fascism yes i replied he stared at me coldly for a moment and then laughed of course of course he said i have nothing to hide the next morning his assistant canceled the interview ukraine is among the poorest countries in europe and the closest thing the continent has to a failing state it is mired in a smoldering conflict with russianbacked separatists in its eastern provinces and its state institutions have been almost entirely captured by competing oligarchs corruption pervades almost every level of government outside kyivs metro stations elderly women in head scarves and bedraggled war veterans beg for change while nearby the streets are lined with luxury shops and petty gangsters run red lights in black suvs without fear of rebuke millions have emigrated to poland or russia for work the capital has the uncanny feel at times of a postmodern weimar where instagram influencers brunch in cafs tricked out in the international hipster style opposite billboards adorned with the faces of ukraines martyrs in the war against russia but perhaps ukraines clearest departure from the standard model of european liberalism is its proliferation of armed farright factions considered by analysts and ordinary ukrainians alike to be the secretly funded private armies of the elite oligarch class they fought in the trenches outside donetsk and now patrol city streets enforcing a particular vision of order with the blessing of overstretched and underfunded police departments in some regions they serve as official election monitors recruitment posters for these militias can be found across kyiv calling on disenchanted veterans and disaffected youths to join them in their mission to remake the world by crushing liberalism to their supporters these groups are enforcers of the popular will defenders of the nation against russian encroachment from the east and liberal values from the west to others especially ukraines westernfunded ngos increasingly isolated outposts of liberal order they pose a serious and growing challenge to ukraines social harmony and ultimately to the state itself the most powerful and ambitious of these militias is azov like many of the countrys armed farright groups it was founded during the revolution when the moscowfriendly autocrat viktor yanukovych was ousted in bloody clashes around kyivs central square maidan nezalezhnosti more than one hundred protesters were killed in the city mostly by snipers from the elite berkut police force before yanukovych was overthrown and forced to flee to russia amid the chaos former members of patriot of ukraine a neonazi paramilitary group established azov the militia first fought in the capital then aided the military in battles against russianbacked separatist forces including the reconquest of the city of mariupol in november azov was officially integrated into the national guard of ukraine with its own armored units and artillery battery since then it has built a wideranging infrastructure of civil and military groupsincluding the national militia an auxiliary police forceand spawned a variety of summer camps training centers and veterans programs in biletsky launched the national corps while they have thus far polled at around percent their failure to generate electoral enthusiasm belies their growing presence both on the streets and within the organs of the state this spring as the novel coronavirus triggered an economic crisis across europe azov capitalized on the uncertainty by pumping out a stream of socialmedia propaganda that highlighted its humanitarian efforts targeting poor ukrainians azov press releases showed masked volunteers disinfecting trams and common spaces in apartment buildings handing out packages of food to families and retirees under quarantine and delivering surgical masks to underfunded clinics and hospitals in neglected provincial towns during this time our volunteers already know better than social services who really needs help claimed one post volunteers are not shown on tv channels but activists do their job every day we help those who really need it who needed it before quarantine and became even more vulnerable during quarantine national corps members repaired crumbling orphanages sewed face masks and plastered walls with advice on hygiene and social distancingmaking a show of performing basic services the ukrainian state was failing to provide at the bottom of each press release was a phone number and the exhortation join us together we will overcome all difficulties ukraines complex ecosystem of farright militias and activist groups is populated by many other organizations that while less influential than azov still play a major role in public life a variety of themincluding tradition and order katechon freikorps sokil and karpatska sichappear at demonstrations with azov though their branding differs some are more overtly christian in their imagery some tend toward neopaganism others are more openly fascist the groups promote one anothers posts on social media especially on the telegram channels used for organizing indicating that some share members with azov and thus may act as front organizations for deniable activity according to oksana pokalchuk the director of amnesty international ukraine more often than not however the groups are committed rivals competing for the largesse of the ukrainian state and primacy in the countrys increasingly heated street politics shortly before biletsky opted to cancel our interview i sat in a bright whitewashedbrick caf in a gentrifying district of kyiv with julian kondur a young roma activist the previous year he told me the citys roma population had been the victims of what he called a pogrom at the hands of c one of azovs smaller farright competitors in april c members burned down a roma encampment in kyivs lysa hora park kondurs romarights organization had asked the police for protection but according to kondur officers turned a blind eye when c returned the next morning to attack the remaining roma with pepper spray the kyiv police claim they were unaware that the second attack was taking place the militia published photographs on its facebook page glorifying the camps destruction these groups dont fight at war they fight here kondur told me to prove that they are also heroes they find an easy target and roma were the easy target i arranged to meet evgen karas cs leader in one of its officesa windowless stone cellar near the arsenalna metro station it comprised a cramped office and kitchen area as well as a hall where cs governmentfunded ngo hosts lectures and workshops for the capitals youth karas his head shaved arrived half an hour late locked in conversation with a few young women dressed sharply but casually like the ceo of a tech startup he settled into the chair opposite me next to a giant flatscreen television that had been playing ukrainian music videos karas spoke in a rapid streamofconsciousness style defending the valuable role his group played in policing kyiv and then expounding a bizarre unproven claim that kyivs police force was engaged in a massive plot to murder elderly and vulnerable people living alone in the city center bury them in secret graves and steal their apartments when i asked karas about the lysa hora incident he claimed that the roma burned down their own encampment though he admitted that posting photographs of the burning tents on facebook was probably a misstep he insisted that cs role was something akin to batmans in gotham city ensuring justice for a desperate neglected populace karas gave an account of what he described as a typical scenario first one of the few good cops hamstrung by the corruption of his superiors and the legal system calls him asking for help closing down an illegal bar selling alcohol to children or chasing drug dealers off the streets then cs foot soldiers arrest the culprits handing them over to the police and sitting in on the resulting trials in a blaze of publicity that karas assured me had brought positive results his men he told me clamp down on petty crime and antisocial behaviorthings that the countrys police are incapable of controlling general crime like robbers thieves people who have stolen cars or who are drunk driving or someone who raped his wifevery often we can do it because we have many on patrol he said he noted that many c members also belong to the municipal guard an auxiliary police militia created by kyivs mayor the threetime world champion heavyweight boxer vitali klitschko with six hundred members many of them military veterans or c fighters from the front lines the municipal guard took part in the lysa hora incident alongside c and was responsible for enforcing kyivs quarantine measures last year according to karas cs effectiveness at maintaining order had translated into some success at the ballot box at least at the local level where several members have won elected office karas himself serves as a member of the civil oversight council at the national anticorruption bureau i was elected he emphasized making a pointed distinction between his group and azov whose success he claims is unfairly derived from the patronage of the countrys interior minister the powerful oligarch arsen avakov karas acknowledged a rumor linking his organization to the director of the countrys security service but dismissed it as hearsay all c receives from the state he said is funding from the ministry for veteran affairs for rehabilitating soldiers plus some money from the ministry of culture for education and resources for training journalists in how to deal with and resist russian propaganda for karas the problem isnt that farright groups are getting government funding but that azov dominates the scene hoovering up patronage and outcompeting smaller rivals on a side street near maidan nezalezhnosti just a few steps from kyivs showpiece mcdonalds is cossack house one of azovs administrative centers before the revolution cossack house provided lodging for military personnel but when the fighting in the square began azov took control transforming the building into a recruiting center field hospital and morgue they now rent the building from the ministry of defense behind steel double doors cossack house is home to a free gym for potential recruits as well as offices lecture halls and a film club the buildings gray neoclassical corridors display shrines to the groups martyred dead as well as glossy leaflets promoting their summer camps funded by the ministry of culture at which children receive patriotic education and weapons training i had ventured to cossack house to meet with ihor mikhailenko the commander of kyivs national militia who like many senior azov figures is a former member of the neonazi patriot of ukraine movement although azov does not formally subscribe to national socialism members are known to tattoo themselves with nazi imagery and fly the swastika flag over their fortifications in the east in what is either a genuine display of ideological loyalty an effort to troll their russian enemies or both ukraines bloody twentiethcentury history creates a certain confusion as so many symbols of ukrainian nationalism and the struggle for independence against the soviet union are inextricably linked to those who collaborated with the invading nazi forces against stalin a moral and political ambiguity that groups such as azov exploit to the furthest possible limit azovs official logo combines the wolfsangel rune of the das reich division of the waffenss with the black sun symbol first employed by ss commander heinrich himmler at wewelsburg castle in germany the groups slick propaganda videos feature young recruits with shaved heads and beards marching in torchlit neopagan ceremonies behind a black sun shieldimagery as inspiring to disaffected young ukrainian men as it is discomfiting to the countrys western backers buzzed into cossack house by the gatekeeper manning its cctv cameras i climbed a curving tsaristera staircase into an empty lecture room where school desks and chairs stood stacked against the walls to wait for mikhailenko he arrived flanked by a burly retinue and exuded an air of barely restrained impatience at being interviewed we dont have a definite field of activity he said of the national militias policing role we are engaged in a very large range of preventive acts of law enforcement in the community as civilians who are helping law enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis mikhailenko had played a central role in azovs formation as a combat unit he told me and he viewed the regiment as his child then i switched to civilian life and saw the problems there he said i realized that it was necessary to act somehow to change the order on the streets humanrights groups allege that the national militias public presence is expressly designed to discourage liberal protest and intimidate civil society charges mikhailenko denies there are no cases where we have put pressure on activists or any other kind of illegal activity he told me we are not involved in illicit activities and all our actions stem from the legislation of ukraine in accordance with the law he claims the national militia is a solution to the failings of the stateparticularly the underrecruitment of policewhich has led to rising crime rates creating in some areas of ukrainian cities an anarchic atmosphere of impunity in which drug dealers dominate housing projects and rival gangs engage in shootouts for control of their business enterprises the attitude of bystanders to our activities is quite positive he said they say that we need more like

2415,Did Blinken Put Poland Outside NATO Protection if It Transfers New Fighter Aircraft to Ukraine?,if you were an adult in and had any political awareness you probably know the story of us ambassador to iraq april glaspie on july glaspie was summoned to the presidential palace in baghdad to meet with saddam hussein and foreign minister tariq aziz on the subject of kuwaiti aggression against iraq in the course of husseins litany complaint about the kuwaitis one of which was kuwait selling oil too cheap glaspie remarked i think i understand this i have lived here for years i admire your extraordinary efforts to rebuild your country i know you need funds we understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country but we have no opinion on the arabarab conflicts like your border disagreement with kuwait at the time this was viewed as having given the green light to hussein to invade kuwait without worrying about an american response after yesterday i wonder if weve created another situation for the war in ukraine to spread by what weve said or failed to say after the russian invasion of ukraine former warsaw pact countries who are all too familiar with the fraternal leadership of russia were quick off the mark to supply ukraine with weapons and supplies to allow them to resist russia some countries put together a plan to provide the ukrainian air force with additional fighter or attack aircraft migs from poland aircraft slovakia and bulgaria and sus from bulgaria the plan was for the aircraft to be ferried to an airbase in poland where they would be married up with ukrainian pilots and flown home i have some questions about the whole plan the western migs and sukhois are not offtheassemblyline aircraft they have western avionics and their powerplants have been upgraded as such they are not the same aircraft operated by the ukrainian air force i havent read any authoritative account of how the ukrainians plan to maintain these aircraft and one cant help but wonder if the plan isnt to service them in poland fly them to a base in ukraine run a few missions there and return to poland last wednesday it looked like the whole deal was breaking down read the whole story at transfer of nato aircraft to ukraine falls through as zelensky resumes his campaign for a nofly zone as it turned out the deal didnt break down because it was impractical it broke down due to the behindthescenes machinations of the biden junta see revealed the real reason that deal to send fighter jets to ukraine fell through this is par for the course the single biggest stumbling block to a unified western response to russias aggression has been joe biden biden is so totally dependent upon the good offices of russia to negotiate a nuclear pact with iran that he cant crack down hard on russia and is forcing our allies to pull their punches as well see will biden betray ukraine and nato by lifting sanctions to get putins help with a new iran nuclear deal on sunday secretary of state tony blinken addressed the subject on meet the press the video is queued to the quote for your convenience chuck todd and joining me now from moldova is secretary of state antony blinken secretary blinken welcome back to meet the press sec antony blinken thanks chuck chuck todd i want to start with some of the asks that president zelenskyy made of congress yesterday morning here our time and i assume he made some similar asks in his phone call with president biden weve got a bullet points here the nofly zone more planes drones and lethal aid a full ban on russian oil imports and to terminate russias preferential trading status i want to set aside the nofly zone situation here for a minute lets start with planes it seems that were close this idea of essentially us fighter jets to poland in exchange poland sends russianmade jets to ukraine is that going to happen and how quickly can it happen sec antony blinken well first let me say this president zelenskyys been a remarkable leader hes been the embodiment of the ukrainian people and everything theyre doing to resist this this russian aggression and president bidens in regular contact with him as he was just yesterday on this question of planes yes were talking very actively about this looking at what we could do to backfill poland if it chooses to send the migs and the suplanes that it has to ukraine how we can help by backfilling what theyre giving to the ukrainians so thats in very active discussion as we speak chuck todd you said if if poland thats a polish decision not a nato decision sec antony blinken its a its a sovereign decision by poland if they choose to do it we want to make sure that we can help them and again backfill what theyre giving so that they dont have any loss in their own ability chuck todd so we are sec antony blinken to provide security chuck todd going to do this if any of these nato nations that have these russianmade planes donate them to the ukraine ukraine were going to backfill if theyre a nato ally sec antony blinken well look we got to wed have to work through each case on its on its own merits got to make sure were able to do something if thats what a countrys requesting in return for for sharing the jets that they have lets take a moment here to consider what putin has said he has declared that an attack on russian forces coming from any country outside ukraine will result in russia considering that as participation in the armed conflict this quote is in the context of the possible nato nofly zone but here is a guy who claims he wants to denazify a country literally headed by a jewish guy in my interpretation blinken just told poland youre on your own scooter he said you are free to send aircraft to ukraine but it is not part of any nato operation suppose putin interprets aircraft ferrying from poland to ukraine as an imminent attack on russian forces and lobs a missile or three at the airbase would we consider that as triggering the mutual defense provisions of article of the north atlantic treaty the topic of transferring aircraft is the subject of a lot of tension in poland too witness this exchange between a polish media outlet and the polish prime ministers office fake news unfortunately you are spreading misinformation with quotation from poland wont send its fighter jets to ukraine as well as allow to use its airports we significantly help in many other areas chancellery of the prime minister of poland march this is sort of ambiguous it can be interpreted that polish aircraft will not participate in combat operations in ukraine or that poland wont transfer aircraft to ukraine to be used in combat the tweet used by the chancery to give its tweet emphasis clearly refers to operations by the polish air force and not to transferring ownership just now the pentagon briefing gave the impression that the aircraft transfer is underway if those aircraft are transferred there is no easy and clean way to do it and not give putin the opportunity to take a shot at poland if he wishes i acknowledge that this interpretation has been subsequently subjected to revisionism but im staying with the original interpretation,https://redstate.com/streiff/2022/03/07/did-blinken-put-poland-outside-nato-protection-if-it-transfers-new-fighter-aircraft-to-ukraine-n532826,Pro-Russian,2,after the russian invasion

8885,An eclair to go with that artillery fire? Welcome to Kyiv's jarring new normal,kyiv ukraine its hard to think of a more unlikely combo than war zones and cinnamon buns yet there the buns are in the display cabinet of khlibar a highend bakery and coffee shop whose name means bread bar in podil the hipster neighborhood in the ukrainian capital kyiv slathered in cream cheese frosting they sit on trays laden with poppy seed pastries cherry rolls cheese braids and delicately constructed puff pastry cakes with a bouffant of icing theres no lack of takers with dozens of patrons lining up in a chaotic queue outside or sitting on high chairs inside for a sugarandcaffeine fix despite the drumbeat of russian artillery and rockets blasting on kyivs outskirts its one sign of the new normal here as the citys remaining residents readjust to a life under conflict the two columns of russian armor thrusting toward the city spurred kyiv to go on a war footing checkpoints with toyjackshaped antitank obstacles concrete slabs and sandbags manned by jittery soldiers and reservists sprouted on every major street and boulevard people lined up in front of supermarkets and pharmacies to stock up on supplies before hurrying home most other establishments were shuttered as possibly half of the citys million people fled to safer areas but three weeks into the invasion some of those still here have begun to make a change khilbar closed at the start of the war but opened again three days later first by offering loaves of bread to help alleviate supply shortages said sergei chernets an entrepreneur who owns four businesses including khlibar we saw a problem people even got into fights over bread so there was a need we opened up and the lines were around the block he said still people were clamoring for something more when people came for bread they kept asking where are the pastries we want pastries chernets said so we decided to do that too he already had summoned his three bakers back to work luckily the rest of his staff was still in kyiv including two pastry chefs he called them all back in every day were getting more customers chernets said adding that up until this week his was the only pastry shop operating in podil before it was just customers from podil now were getting them from the center and the other districts for victor mozhovi a cameraman with local public broadcaster suspilne who was sitting down at a table and demolishing an eclair with a colleague places such as khilbar are a marker of what now seems a time long ago i drive in the car we travel around and i see my office i remember work its just been a few weeks but it feels like a year he said mozhovi had volunteered as a military videographer in covering the war against russianbacked separatists in eastern ukraine for a year before returning to civilian life now he was back in a war again a lot of people cant understand this transformation but i lived this in and already know war is war he said running his fork through the eclair which split open with a soft creamfilled crunch its important to have this just to feel im still living the life i used to have a few weeks ago a stroll on a sunny spring day through podil which once was the heart of kyivs industrial trade shows others also trying to recapture a hint of their preinvasion lifestyle a few blocks away from khilbar valentina yermak sat in a chair in the koko nailroom while theresa voloshyna trained her discerning eye on a lock of yermaks hair her hands a constant whirl around her customers head i want to feel like a woman i dont want my looks to go down and i want to stay elegant yermak said she gestured to voloshyna and theresa is excellent the salon reopened tuesday after the proprietor whos now in bulgaria received many inquiries for appointments on her instagram page voloshyna was one of three staff members still in kyiv all the rest have gone to germany to poland lviv everywhere she said the building she lives in has units but only are still occupied she initially volunteered with a group preparing medicines and other supplies but there was less need for her there at the moment so she decided to go back to work but that too was a form of assistance she found people are really happy when they see us they pay for us to come to their house by taxi and pay us extra its relaxing for them to see us she said adding that she was getting calls for something as simple as a manicure touchup voloshyna a fashionable woman with a blond pixie cut and an air of steely competence said that although curfew meant the salon couldnt be open for the hours daily as it was before the war there were still plenty of walkins people tell us because i see you open the salon we have hope she said adding that only one appointment was scheduled that day but that seven people had come in so far the reopenings are more than just a psychological boost the war in ukraine is having a cataclysmic effect on the countrys finances this week the international monetary fund said the ukrainian economy is set to contract by and possibly by as much as if the war drags on for a long time though the imf has announced rapidfinancing measures for ukraine they cant stop the devastation already wrought on the countrys infrastructure which is thought to be in the billion range that prompted president volodymyr zelenskyy this week in between speeches to lawmakers around the world pleading for more military aid to ease regulations and tax requirements for ukrainian businesses scrapping valueadded tax and taxes on profit and levying only a single corporate tax of on large companies for smaller businesses tax payments would be voluntary zelenskyy said that is if you can pay you cant no questions asked he said in a video address this week inspections also would be canceled for all businesses in order to allow everyone to work normally in order to enable cities to return to life in order to allow life to continue in all places where there is no fighting he said adding that the economic suppression of ukraine was one of russias war aims there is only one condition you must ensure the normal operation of your business within the framework of ukrainian legislation zelenskyy said some entrepreneurs are also reorienting their businesses toward helping the government michael chobanian a bitcoin maven who started kuna a cryptocurrency exchange already had transferred much of his staff from the company office in podil to the balkan nation of montenegro ahead of the hostilities he too has left ukraine but is leveraging his exchange to help the government in kyiv convert the estimated million in crypto donations received since the war began to us dollars or other currencies weve already managed some of that and now were trying to scale up because a lot of donations are coming in through bitcoin he said my job is to make sure everything is going as fast as possible with minimum commissions and cost zelenskyys message to reopen also has resonated with kyivites engaged in more quotidian businesses thats why maria liashenko a yearold barista ensconced amid the accoutrements of a buck coffee roasters branch in podil reopened the store tuesday i did it for the guests for the economy it needs to be supported our military needs to get paid she said this is my country and i will not surrender

victory at least in russias view which means their approach to the conflict is trending towards genocide the official legal definition of genocide is acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group as such when i teach genocide i start by saying that this definition has huge problems because it doesnt give us eugene finkel april that doesnt

4923,General Now Leading Putinâ€™s War in Ukraine Has Brutal Reputation As â€˜Butcher of Syriaâ€™,gen aleksandr dvornikov with russian president vladimir putin at a medal award ceremony at the kremlin in putin awarded him the title of hero of the russian federation photo the kremlin cnsnewscom russian president vladimir putin has placed in charge of the invasion of ukraine an army general notorious for ruthless actions in support of the assad regime in syria prompting concerns that the conflict could become even more brutal gen aleksandr dvornikovs appointment to the task has already been linked to a missile strike friday on a railway station in eastern ukraine where several thousand people trying to flee the region ahead of the russian forces were waiting to evacuate more than people including children were killed in the attack in kramatorsk the general led the russian military effort to prop up syrian president bashar assad in before being promoted to command the russian military district that covers the north caucasus as well as russianoccupied crimea in the syrian campaign russian and assad regime operations against the rebelheld eastern city of aleppo included the use of incendiary and cluster munitions in the bombing of civilian areas and facilities including hospitals putin in awarded him the title of hero of the russian federation you have a new commander in the ukraine invasion you have general dvornikov david petraeus former cia director and commander of us central command said on cnns state of the union on sunday he is known as the butcher of syria for this brutal campaign that he prosecuted in syria when he was the commander there in host jake tapper asked petraeus if dvornikovs appointment meant there would even more targeting of civilians i fear that it may he said again the russians were known in syria basically for quote depopulating areas thats what they did to aleppo thats what they did to other areas and i think we can expect that we saw the very first operation taken under him includes that terrible strike on the rail station with the russians having pulled back from the failed attempt to capture kyiv to focus on the donbas region in the southeast petraeus said they likely hope to succeed there by may the day russia marks victory in world war ii the hallmark of the russian forces so far has been indiscipline not discipline petraeus said it has been violation of the geneva convention and the law of land warfare and so forth we have seen repeated evidence of that and thats what were going to see more of i fear in the days and weeks that lie ahead so we got to do everything we can to provide everything as quickly as possible he added in reference to military weapons and equipment ukraine is asking for national security advisor jake sullivan said on the same program that no appointment of a general to oversee the war can erase the fact that russia has already faced a strategic failure in ukraine but he also acknowledged dvornikovs controversial record this particular general has a resume that includes a brutality against civilians in other theaters in syria and we can expect more of the same in this theater he said this general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against ukrainian civilians sullivan said and the united states as i said before is determined to do all that we can to support the ukrainians as they resist him and they resist the forces that he commands devastation in aleppo syria caused by russian and assad regime bombing in photo by thaer mohammedafp via getty images dvornikov has been sanctioned by the british government since for actions in support of the consolidation of the illegal annexation of the crimean peninsula into the russian federation which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity of ukraine cruel and criminal and wrong and evil russias defense and foreign ministries denied responsibility for fridays deadly missile strike on the kramatorsk train station charging that ukrainian armed forces were to blame obviously we are not buying the denial by the russians that they werent responsible said a senior pentagon official briefing on background i would note that they originally claimed a successful strike and then only retracted it when there were reports of civilian casualties the official said so its our full expectation that this was a russian strike as of friday the un human rights office in geneva said it had recorded ukrainian civilians killed and injured in the sixweek war with most casualties caused by shelling missiles and in air strikes as before it said the actual figures are believed to be considerably higher when putin on february announced the invasion he said the goal was to strive for the

7116,Putin recognizes independence of Ukraine breakaway regions,russian president vladimir putin on monday recognized as independent two breakaway territories in eastern ukraine marking a sharp escalation in tensions between moscow and the west in signing the decrees recognizing the donetsk peoples republic and luhansk peoples republic putin rejected diplomatic efforts to cease fighting and pledged more assistance to separatists battling ukrainian forces i deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the donetsk peoples republic and luhansk peoples republic putin said in a speech from moscow in translated remarks i would request the federal assembly to back this decision and ratify the agreement of friendship and mutual help with both republics putin made the announcement at the end of a winding speech that set out his vision of a ukraine that has historically been part of russia and is now under the control of the west he also used the occasion to fire off a litany of accusations against ukraine the us and western allies coupled with a sharp demand for kyiv to stop hostilities and a rejection of the authority of the ukrainian government as having been established in a coup following the revolution in the country he was joined in moscow for a signing ceremony by the selfdeclared heads of two territories and said the documents were to ratify an agreement of friendship and mutual aid those who seize the power and keep the power in kyiv we demand to stop hostilities immediately otherwise all the responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodbath will be on the consciousness of the regime that is ruling in kyiv by declaring these decisions im confident that i will have support of all the patriotic forces of russia putin said the russian presidents actions on monday prompted a quick response from the biden administration with white house press secretary jen psaki issuing a statement that the us was preparing to immediately imposing sanctions we have anticipated a move like this from russia and are ready to respond immediately psaki said in a statement adding that the sanctions include prohibiting new investment trade and financing by us persons to from or in the socalled dnr donetsk and lnr luhansk regions of ukraine additional measures are expected to be announced she added us allies also rejected putins move with the kremlin referencing pushback from france and germany in a phone call with the russian leader where he informed them of his decision to recognize the separatists regions as independent the president of france and the federal chancellor of germany expressed their disappointment with this development at the same time they indicated their readiness to continue contacts the kremlin said in a statement putin set up his announcement monday by earlier presiding over a public and highly choreographed meeting of the russian national security council where members expressed near unanimity for the kremlin to recognize the territories as independent the russian president said he had convened the meeting in response to requests from the selfdeclared leaders of the donetsk and luhansk regions requesting moscow recognize their independence and a resolution passed in the russian state duma supporting moscow conferring independence the biden administration had earlier warned against putin making such a move with secretary of state antony blinken saying the us would impose a swift and firm response if the kremlin recognized independence and that it would be viewed as a rejection of the minsk agreements a diplomatic framework established in aimed at ending the fighting between ukrainian forces and russianbacked separatists in the donbas where an estimated people have been killed a white house official said monday that president biden was meeting with his national security team to discuss the developments related to russia and ukraine with reports of blinken secretary of defense lloyd austin and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley at the white house ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy wrote on twitter that he had spoken with french president emanuel macron and german chancellor olaf sholz following putins security council meeting and convened a meeting of the ukrainian national security and defense council fighting has escalated in the donbas in recent days with us ukrainian and other european officials placing blame on russianbacked separatists for provoking violence including the shelling of a kindergarten in the region and praising ukrainian forces for restraint the increase in fighting is coupled with warnings from the us and its allies and partners that russia seeks to manufacture a falseflag operation to create a pretext for russia to invade ukraine and would launch a largescale invasion with nearly troops that includes removing the ukrainian government in kyiv estonias prime minister kaja kallas tweeted earlier on monday that recognizing the breakaway regions would be a serious escalation by the kremlin it would be a clear and grave violation of international law and the territorial integrity of ukraine donetsk and luhansk are and will be part of ukraine she wrote on twitter this decision would also end the minsk agreements by saying no to a political solution based on the minsk agreements the kremlin shuts the door on diplomacy and creates an excuse for war british prime minister boris johnson called putins move a breach of international law and a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of ukraine during a press conference johnson further said the move showed moscow rejecting diplomacy in the format of the minsk agreements and its a very ill omen and a very dark sign and it certainly is yet another indication that things are moving in the wrong direction in ukraine we will continue to think about what more we can do support ukraine in what is clearly a very very dark and difficult time the prime minister said european union president ursula von der leyen echoed johnsons condemnations and said the eu and its partners will react with unity firmness and with determination in solidarity with ukraine evelyn farkas who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for russia ukraine and eurasia during the obama administration said recognition of the donbas as independent may trigger some sanctions but that more devastating consequences would be reserved to be used against military action i think the biden people have been pretty clear that it is military action they are looking for to include cyber and little green men farkas said but added that recognition could be a prelude to using armed force the reality is if he goes ahead and recognizes them hes likely to send more forces in and thats likely to trigger sanctions she said likening it to russia sending troops into georgie in after recognizing separtist territories in the northeastern and central part of that country as independent michael mcfaul who served as us ambassador to russia during the obama administration wrote on twitter that putins recognition of luhansk and donetsk is likely an opening salvo against ukraine after putin recognizes donetsk and luhansk zelensky will have to respond right and if he does then putin can justify invading as a reaction to ukrainian aggression and protection of their new allies he tweeted morgan chalfant contributed to this report updated at

10840,"Ukraine war, North Koreaâ€™s nukes, Chinaâ€™s rise: Whatâ€™s on the agenda as Biden meets Quad leaders in Tokyo",by jessie yeung cnn us president joe biden is scheduled to meet the leaders of india australia and japan in tokyo on tuesday for a summit of the quad nations the meeting comes at the end of bidens first trip to asia since becoming president a fiveday visit he began in south korea the quad or quadrilateral security dialogue is an informal group focused on security that dates back to the early s it has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter chinas reach and territorial claims in the indopacific the war in ukraine north koreas weapons program taiwan and a controversial new security deal between china and the solomon islands in the pacific are among the issues likely to be discussed at the summit heres what you need to know about the quad how did it form the partnership has its roots in the response to the devastating indian ocean earthquake and tsunami when the four countries set up a regional core group to help relief efforts but the quad in its current form was created in and held its first meeting in may that year in a speech several months after that first meeting japans thenprime minister shinzo abe described his vision of a broader asia an immense network spanning the entirety of the pacific ocean incorporating the united states of america and australia the countries shared fundamental values such as freedom and democracy and common strategic interests he said the initiative fell apart in under intense pressure from china and the threat of economic retaliation said cleo paskal a nonresident senior fellow for the indopacific at the foundation for defense of democracies but it was revived in amid renewed concerns about chinas rapid rise as a global superpower and beijings increasingly aggressive foreign policy since then the group has grown more active with the four heads of state holding a symbolic virtual meeting in march before then meeting in person for the first time in september that year at the time a senior us official emphasized the quad was an unofficial gathering but called it a key and critical format adding we are deepening coordination on a daily basis what does the quad do though sometimes dubbed by critics as an asian nato the quad is not a formal military alliance rather its an informal strategic forum featuring semiregular summits information exchanges and military drills it does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in nato like the concept of collective defense where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all its deliberately more amorphous than that so that it can withstand changes in political decisionmaking in each of the democracies and respond in a more diffuse but effective way around things like vaccines or economics paskal said quad members cooperate across fields including covid and natural disasters climate change and sustainability but security and the goal of a free and open indopacific are key focuses with the four nations frequently highlighting threats such as terrorism disinformation and territorial disputes military cooperation has increased in recent years with australia joining the other three in the malabar naval exercises the first time all four members had participated in the drills since last september the us the united kingdom and australia signed a security deal known as aukus that will eventually bring nuclearpowered submarines to the region a move that set off a diplomatic firestorm with france and angered china and this january japan and australia signed a treaty to strengthen defense and security cooperation with australia saying the agreement included an expanding agenda for the quad how does china play into this the quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to chinas growing reach in the region with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with beijing over the past few years the indiachina relationship has come under growing strain since may when troops from both sides were involved in a deadly clash along their disputed himalayan border australia and china have been involved in a series of trade spats since canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of covid while japan and china remain at odds over disputed islands in the east china sea the uschina relationship has also steadily deteriorated exacerbated by a trade war pandemic fingerpointing and military saberrattling the strategic location of each of the quad nations at different corners of the indopacific and with china in between them has rattled beijing which fears the potential for military encirclement it has condemned the bloc as an antichina clique that is emblematic of a poisonous cold war mentality exacerbating these tensions china has reiterated its territorial claims and taken a harder line in response to perceived challenges in recent years china has built up its military positions in the south china sea despite a un tribunal dismissing its territorial claims there it has also ramped up threats against taiwan a selfgoverning island the chinese communist party sees as part of its territory despite never having ruled it and has sent fighter jets into its air defense identification zone chinas rise is now the global phenomenon that not only involves the neighboring nations but also the safety of maritime security in the south china sea malacca straits all the way to the indian ocean said ken jimbo a professor in the faculty of policy management at japans keio university in april china announced a security pact with the solomon islands sparking protests from australia new zealand and the us many were concerned it would allow china to build a military base in the tiny pacific nation though the islands leader has said he has no intention of this happening still some onlookers say the agreement makes australia less safe and threatens to further destabilize the solomon islands where the governments close relationship with beijing has already sparked protests what countries are realizing more and more is that the economic investment from china is designed to lead to a weakening of political will within those countries which brings it more strongly into the chinese orbit said paskal from the foundation for defense of democracies what are the other major issues other issues that may come up at the summit include the security of taiwan a recent surge of chinese air incursions has raised fears for the future of the democratic island top us intelligence officials told congress this month that china might be attempting to build a military capable of taking over taiwan and the island faces an acute threat between now and quad members have voiced support for taiwan which the us supplies with arms for self defense on monday during a press conference in japan us president joe biden said the us would intervene militarily if china attempts to take taiwan by force a warning that appeared to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally held by washington the white house quickly downplayed the comments saying they dont reflect a change in us policy but many analysts have drawn parallels between russias invasion of ukraine and taiwans situation concerns echoed by japanese prime minister fumio kishida in may when he said peace in the taiwan strait was critical and countries must never tolerate forceful attempts to change the status quo in east asia if taiwan falls to china that breaks the first island chain and compromises japanese security paskal said the fall of taiwan is a deep security threat to all four quad partners north korea and its weapons program will also likely be on the table said jimbo the keio university professor the country has recently stepped up its missile testing in defiance of international law and to the alarm of japan and the us it has launched missile tests this year so far compared to four tests in and eight in the war in ukraine will be another focus with the summit taking place exactly three months after russia launched its invasion australia japan and the us have all taken hard stances in condemning the invasion and imposing sanctions on moscow leaving india the odd one out india has long enjoyed friendly relations and a defense relationship with moscow most estimates suggest more than of indias military equipment comes from russia these supplies are vital given indias border tensions with both china and pakistan though indias position has caused a significant amount of frustration among the other three bloc members jimbo said it also reminds us that we do not really have the luxury to lose india

secretary steven mnuchin making a similar accusation importantly their letter connected some of the dots highlighting russias covert efforts to fund various environmental organizations that were trying to limit or end us hydraulic fracturing or fracking for shale gas and oil the media and democrats mostly shrugged their collective shoulders at these allegations they were far too busy trying to prove the nowdiscredited russiantrump election collusion to be bothered with a more plausible russianenvironmental activist collusion maybe russias invasion of ukraine will force those naysayers to reconsider the accusations and evidence and begin new investigations according to the guardian rasmussen who was also a former prime minister of denmark claimed in a presentation to a think tank in london i have met allies who can report that russia as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations engaged actively with socalled nongovernmental organizations ngos environmental organizations working against shale gas to maintain european dependence on imported russian gas he declined to give details saying only that is my interpretation natos press office said the remarks were rasmussens personal views not official nato policy but a nato official did tell the guardian russia has been using a mix of hard and soft power in its attempt to recreate a sphere of influence including through a campaign of disinformation on many issues including energy while environmental ngos denounced rasmussens claims money can be laundered through various organizations in such a way that the final recipient eg a nonprofit environmental activist group has no idea of the fundings real origins and thats where the smithweber letter comes in the letter notes that former secretary of state hillary clinton complained in a speech to a private audience in we were even up against phony environmental groups and im a big environmentalist but these were funded by the russians smith and weber assert that the russian government and complicit parties had a scheme that allows money originating from foreign countries like russia to funnel through bermudabased shell companies to environmental groups in the united states with the aim of disrupting the us energy industry they alleged that tens of millions of dollars were handed to bermudabased klein ltd which then funneled the money to the sea change foundation which distributed the funds to various ngos clearly environmental groups have had some success with their antifracking efforts new york washington and maryland have banned fracking california gov gavin newsom issued and executive order last year banning fracking in the state by as for europe fracking was never really embraced the smithweber letter includes much more detail than i can here so look at their letter for yourself it does not establish russian culpability but it does provide a solid basis for further investigation if congress and the media are finally interested and they just might be given russian president vladimir putins horrendous and unjustified invasion of ukraine there could be a lot of interest in investigating putins foreign mischief in hindsight it is increasingly apparent that putin has been preparing for his ukrainian invasion for years dominating the global energy market by covertly working to limit us production would have been a huge coup in more ways than one instead over the past decade the united states became the worlds energy powerhouse producing million barrels of crude oil per day in compared to russias million barrels per day according to the us energy information administration eia as for natural gas the eia says the united states produced trillion cubic feet in verses trillion cubic feet for russia had russia dominated global energy production putin would be in a better position to thumb his nose at countries critical of his invasion and deprive his critics of needed oil

8921,"How hackers, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the State Department are trying to pierce Putinâ€™s digital Iron Curtain",by sean lyngaas kylie atwood and brian fung cnn the information campaign over russias invasion of ukraine is in full swing as a wide cast of characters from the us state department to ukrainian hackers to arnold schwarzenegger tries to circumvent russian censors to get the truth about the war on ukraine to russian citizens the efforts echo cold warera radio broadcasts into the soviet union but messaging apps and other free digital tools mean that an array of outsiders from digital activists to schwarzenegger the hollywood icon who posted a video addressing russians on thursday can more easily join the campaign the state department created an account on telegram a messaging app popular with russians four days into the war in ukraine as it became clear that washington was missing an opportunity to interact with russians a senior department official told cnn a series of posts on the account in russian have amplified president joe bidens denunciations of the war and cautioned russians about moscows propaganda machine long before the kremlin launched its fullscale invasion of ukraine it had stepped up its campaign of disinformation and censorship of independent media and continues to do so even during the war of aggression the department said from its telegram account thursday russian engagement with the state department telegram account to date appears to be very modest the account had subscribers as of friday afternoon moscow time and the countrys total population is around million analysts say it is unlikely that any single platform or messaging campaign is going to break through with the russian public in a significant way but the goal shared by a range of actors trying to pierce the digital iron curtain is to chip away cumulatively at russian public support for the war and the morale of russian soldiers the state department also has an account on russian messaging platform vk has set up a website to rebut russian disinformation in recent weeks and has worked to get us officials on russianlanguage broadcast platforms the official said not a silver bullet none of it is a silver bullet the state department official said acknowledging the formidable wall of censorship in russia which has blocked access to twitter and facebook but some critics have suggested the us government needs to do more and aim to emulate the huge propaganda effort of the cold war when significant resources were dedicated to pushing messaging toward the soviet population russian authorities have detained thousands of people protesting the war in ukraine a russian state television journalist who interrupted a live news broadcast monday holding a sign that said no war was detained and fined about but could still face prison time this is a real achilles heel for putin james clapper who served as president barack obamas director of national intelligence told cnn the us government he said should be using any social media platform available to bring images of dead russian soldiers and prisoners of war to russian citizens several russian prisoners of war have appeared at news conferences held by ukrainian authorities that may be a questionable practice under the geneva convention which forbids states from causing unnecessary humiliation to prisoners of war this sort of thing lends itself to covert action on the part of the us government clapper said and i trust and hope that we are doing something along those lines the us intelligence community is closely watching public opinion in russia but its not clear whether there is any planning underway to conduct any form of clandestine information operations were watching whats happening in russia said one western source familiar with the intelligence who added that it is not clear yet whether public opinion is breaking for or against the war there are less shadowy ways of supporting the free flow of information into russia alina polyakova president of the nonprofit center for european policy analysis said the state departments telegram account is a step in the right direction but frankly its not creative enough russians today dont appear to trust western media or government officials as sources of information the way they did in the waning days of the cold war said polyakova who grew up in kyiv in the s we really need to be more creative about thinking who the right messengers are she added pointing to the numerous journalists who have fled russia in recent weeks as the kremlin has criminalized independent reporting on the war in ukraine western governments and philanthropic organizations now have a huge opportunity to support these journalists as they will likely continue reporting from abroad and connecting with russian audiences who trust them polyakova said we should bring real news to them while the state department lobs carefully worded messages to russian citizens a loose band of volunteer hackers from ukraine and abroad are being more confrontational the socalled ukrainian it army which kyiv is actively encouraging has looked to hack russian news sites and post information about russian casualties in ukraine according to yegor aushev a ukrainian cybersecurity executive who said he helped organize the hacking collective on behalf of the ukrainian ministry of defense russian citizens dont know a lot about whats going on here aushev said by phone from ukraine thats why we decided that one of the most important targets should be media we should bring real news to them but reaching a russian audience doesnt require breaking into a computer americans are among the many people who have sent text messages to russians using a website built by an international group of volunteer programmers known as squad stacey mccue a florida nurse has sent roughly text messages and hundreds of emails to russians using the platform she began personalizing the messages with her own voice saying that moscow has been lying to its citizens and that the war has killed civilians so far mccue has gotten only three responses f off crimea is ours and one reply threatening to forward your message to the appropriate authorities stop making such calls the hostile responses havent deterred mccue i think its better to be proactive to make a stand even if its a small thing to try to influence the overall situation she told cnn more highprofile americans are joining the cause schwarzenegger the terminator star and excalifornia governor addressed the russian people in a video with russian subtitles he posted thursday to his million twitter followers and more than telegram subscribers i hope that you will let me tell you the truth about the war in ukraine and what is happening there schwarzenegger said before detailing the russian bombing of a ukrainian maternity ward a source close to schwarzenegger told cnn that the former bodybuilder made the video on his own accord and wasnt asked to do so by the us government but the state department telegram account wasted no time in sharing the video and others in the information ecosystem followed suit blake ferrell a plumber from indiana told cnn that he sent schwarzeneggers video to several russians on telegram and still images of the actors speech to other russians via the squad texting platform ferrell hasnt received any replies yet but he wants to keep trying to reach a russian audience for me its the excitement of actually reaching another person he

9551,Did You Know Trumpâ€™s First Impeachment Was About Ukraine?,before volodymyr zelensky faced down vladimir putin he stood up to another megalomaniac the first impeachment of president trump is just over two years old but it remains lost on many americans that it was all about ukraine and not just about ukraine in a generic sense but specifically about trump using ukraines vulnerability to russia to pressure it to find dirt on the bidens to force ukraines hand to his advantage trump thwarted longstanding us policy to support and arm its ally in the face of the russian threat zelensky didnt waver the saga of the first impeachment went down the memory hole quickly overwhelmed by covid trumps efforts to subvert the election and bidens win but now in a sense weve come full circle as kyiv draws on stockpiles of american weaponry and bipartisan support today to defend against vladimir putins attack its worth a brief refresher on how trump threatened to and for a time did withhold that kind of support for his own personal political ends where was ukraine when trump entered the picture russian interference in the presidential election went a long way towards making the question of us support for ukraine not just a foreign policy issue but a domestic political issue as well to counter the narrative that russia was at least partly responsible for his victory trump argued that ukraine had in fact intervened on the side of the democrats while being in cahoots with hillary clinton there was zero evidence to support this but it came as ukraine struggled to strengthen itself the country had undergone a revolution in after which russia annexed crimea and fomented a war in the countrys east at the top of ukraines agenda was maintaining western support for its government military and attempts to build the kinds of economic relations with the european union that would allow it to drift away from russia the us had committed to giving ukraine defense assistance and its embassy in kyiv via ambassador marie yovanovitch had taken to openly pressuring government officials to take a tougher stance against graft after five years of war and disappointing progress in the fight against corruption ukrainians were exhausted with the government that was elected after the revolution in march they elected a former comedian volodymyr zelensky who ran in part on a campaign to try to cut a deal with vladimir putin to end the war for that he needed us support what did trump do trump congratulated zelensky on his victory in a july phone call which would become central to the first impeachment on the call trump mentioned something else he needed a favor zelensky told trump that ukraine was almost ready to buy more javelins from the united states for defense purposes javelins are the usmade and exported antitank missile system that have been extremely effective in ukraines defense against russia trump replied i would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and ukraine knows a lot about it trump then launched into a discussion of various conspiracy theories about ukrainian involvement in the election suggesting to zelensky that the countrys law enforcement needed to get to the bottom of that and find out about hunter biden the son of joe biden who took a job on the board of a ukrainian gas company within weeks nearly million in us military aid that had been scheduled to go to ukraine had been frozen multiple ukrainian and us officials would later report that various trump cronies had pressured the ukrainian government in various ways to produce dirt on the bidens to get the hold lifted how did that lead to his impeachment a whistleblower from the national security council came forward in august about the call after a clumsy attempt by the trump administration to suppress the tip it came out trump had used the power of american foreign policy for his personal political benefit trying to extort ukraine into manufacturing dirt about his opponent in exchange for military aid that the country was already supposed to get the house of representatives launched an impeachment inquiry in september public hearings and depositions with trump administration officials throughout the fall revealed the scope of the scandal multiple senior trump administration officials had been involved in the effort which stretched far beyond the july phone call the investigation revealed other instances of pressure trump had ordered vice president mike pence for example to blow off attending zelenskys inauguration in may months afterward after the july phone call trump had pence tell the ukrainians that military aid would not be forthcoming until the united states saw more action on corruption by that point multiple trump administration officials had taken to use corruption as a byword for investigations into the bidens rudy giuliani trumps personal lawyer had gotten involved in us foreign policy trying to press ukrainian officials into opening investigations into hunter biden and his father the frontrunner in the democratic primary at the time giuliani along with ukraineborn associates lev parnas and igor fruman had also sought to remove yovanovitch the us ambassador in kyiv the impeachment investigation along with a federal criminal campaign finance case against parnas and fruman alleged that that took place at the direction of a ukrainian official texts released by parnas suggested that this was ukraines prosecutor general who the ambassador had criticized and who offered a deal in exchange for yovanovitchs firing he would announce investigations into hunter and joe biden what were the consequences for ukraine the hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid some of it of the kind that has proved decisive in ukraines defense against russias invasion was eventually released since then ukraine has continued to receive more military aid from the us in the form of antitank weapons small arms and other items some of those us officials involved in pushing trumps drug deal as john bolton called it are still involved in policy discussions kurt volker the us special envoy to the region is out of government but regularly opines on ukrainerelated issues even after having been forced to substantially change his congressional testimony the longlasting damage has been less tangible but arguably more important american unity to support ukraine and zelenskys political agenda on the latter zelensky ran on a campaign of negotiating with putin to find a deal ukrainian officials needed political support from the united states and instead got demands to investigate hunter biden on the former oldschool establishment republicans do still back us support for ukraine but the maga right along with acolytes like tucker carlson do not portraying the country as a needless waste of resources while making bizarre comparisons to the usmexico border trump himself this week showed willingness to do the same thing again how is it that the mayor of moscow his wife gave the biden family three and a half million dollars trump told john solomon i think putin now would be willing to probably give that answer im sure he knows,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/did-you-know-trumps-first-impeachment-was-about-ukraine,Neutral,1,before volodymyr zelensky faced down vladimir putin he stood up to another megalomaniac the first impeachment of president trump is just over two years old the saga of the first impeachment went down the memory hole quickly overwhelmed by covid trumps efforts to subvert the election and bidens win now in a sense weve come full circle as kyiv draws on stockpiles of american weaponry and bipartisan support today to defend against v vladimir putins attack its worth a brief refresher on how trump threatened to and for a time did withhold that kind of support for his own personal political ends where was ukraine when trump entered the picture russian interference in the presidential election went a long way towards making the question of us support for ukraines not just a foreign policy issue but a domestic political issue as well to counter the narrative that russia was at least partly responsible for his victory trump argued that ukraine had in fact intervened on the side of the democrats while being in cahoots with hillary clinton there was zero evidence to support this but it came as the country had undergone a revolution in after which russia annexed crimea and fomented a war in the countrys east after five years of war and disappointing progress in the fight against graft ukranes were exhausted with the government that was elected after the revolution in march they elected a former comedian volody myr zleensky who ran in part on a campaign to try to cut a deal with vlad vladimir putin to end the war for that he needed us support what did trump do on the call which would become central to the first

the country was already supposed to get the house of representatives launched an impeachment inquiry in september public hearings and depositions with trump administration officials throughout the fall revealed the scope of the effort which stretched far beyond the investigation into the bidens scandal multiple senior trump officials had been involved in the effort to blow off the blow to blow

1324,Ignored Warnings: How NATO Expansion Led to the Ukraine Tragedy,nato secretary general jens stoltenberg attends a press conference after a nato video summit on russia invasion of ukraine at the nato headquarters in brussels on feb photo credit kenzo tribouillardafp via getty images nato expansion the trigger for russias attack on ukraine russias military offensive against ukraine is an act of aggression that will make already worrisome tensions between nato and moscow even more dangerous the wests new cold war with russia has turned hot vladimir putin bears primary responsibility for this latest development but natos arrogant tonedeaf policy toward russia over the past quartercentury deserves a large share as well analysts committed to a us foreign policy of realism and restraint have warned for more than a quartercentury that continuing to expand the most powerful military alliance in history toward another major power would not end well the war in ukraine provides definitive confirmation that it did not thinking through the ukraine crisis the causes it would be extraordinarily difficult to expand nato eastward without that action being viewed by russia as unfriendly even the most modest schemes would bring the alliance to the borders of the old soviet union some of the more ambitious versions would have the alliance virtually surround the russian federation itself beyond nato staying out of europes wars p i wrote those words in at a time when expansion proposals merely constituted occasional speculation in foreign policy seminars in new york city and washington dc i added that expansion would constitute a needless provocation of russia what was not publicly known at the time was that bill clintons administration had already made the fateful decision the previous year to push for including some former warsaw pact countries in nato the administration would soon propose inviting poland the czech republic and hungary to become members and the us senate approved adding those countries to the north atlantic treaty in it would be the first of several waves of membership expansion even that first stage provoked russian opposition and anger in her memoir clintons secretary of state madeleine albright concedes that russian president boris yeltsin and his countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement seeing it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability and moving europes dividing line to the east leaving them isolated deputy secretary of state strobe talbott similarly described the russian attitude many russians see nato as a vestige of the cold war inherently directed against their country they point out that they have disbanded the warsaw pact their military alliance and ask why the west should not do the same it was an excellent question and neither the clinton administration nor its successors provided even a remotely convincing answer george kennan the intellectual father of americas containment policy during the cold war perceptively warned in a may new york times interview about what the senates ratification of natos first round of expansion would set in motion i think it is the beginning of a new cold war kennan stated i think the russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies i think it is a tragic mistake there was no reason for this whatsoever no one was threatening anybody else he was right but us and nato leaders proceeded with new rounds of expansion including the provocative step of adding the three baltic republics those countries not only had been part of the soviet union but they had also been part of russias empire during the czarist era that wave of expansion now had nato perched on the border of the russian federation moscows patience with natos ever more intrusive behavior was wearing thin the last reasonably friendly warning from russia that the alliance needed to back off came in march when putin addressed the annual munich security conference nato has put its frontline forces on our borders putin complained nato expansion represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust and we have the right to ask against whom is this expansion intended and what happened to the assurances our western partners made after the dissolution of the warsaw pact in his memoir duty robert m gates who served as secretary of defense in the administrations of both george w bush and barack obama stated his belief that the relationship with russia had been badly mismanaged after george hw bush left office in among other missteps us agreements with the romanian and bulgarian governments to rotate troops through bases in those countries was a needless provocation in an implicit rebuke to the younger bush gates asserted that trying to bring georgia and ukraine into nato was truly overreaching that move he contended was a case of recklessly ignoring what the russians considered their own vital national interests the following year the kremlin demonstrated that its discontent with natos continuing incursions into russias security zone had moved beyond verbal objections moscow exploited a foolish provocation by georgias prowestern government to launch a military offensive that brought russian troops to the outskirts of the capital thereafter russia permanently detached two secessionistminded georgian regions and put them under effective russian control western especially us leaders continued to blow through red warning light after red warning light however the obama administrations shockingly arrogant meddling in ukraines internal political affairs in and to help demonstrators overthrow ukraines elected prorussia president was the single most brazen provocation and it caused tensions to spike moscow immediately responded by seizing and annexing crimea and a new cold war was underway with a vengeance could the ukraine crisis have been avoided events during the past few months constituted the last chance to avoid a hot war in eastern europe putin demanded that nato provide guarantees on several security issues specifically the kremlin wanted binding assurances that the alliance would reduce the scope of its growing military presence in eastern europe and would never offer membership to ukraine he backed up those demands with a massive military buildup on ukraines borders the biden administrations response to russias quest for meaningful western concessions and security guarantees was tepid and evasive putin then clearly decided to escalate matters washingtons attempt to make ukraine a nato political and military pawn even absent the countrys formal membership in the alliance may end up costing the ukrainian people dearly the ukraine tragedy history will show that washingtons treatment of russia in the decades following the demise of the soviet union was a policy blunder of epic proportions it was entirely predictable that nato expansion would ultimately lead to a tragic perhaps violent breach of relations with moscow perceptive analysts warned of the likely consequences but those warnings went unheeded we are now paying the price for the us foreign policy

7510,Sanctions vs. neutrality: Swiss fine-tune response to Russia,geneva ap russias invasion of ukraine has put switzerlands muchvaunted neutrality to the test and along with it the countrys traditional role as international intermediary and reputation as a safe haven for the assets of russias richest and most powerful the swiss executive branch stopped short of announcing unilateral sanctions against russian interests after moscows blistering military action in ukraine instead the federal council opted to fall in line with the european union and pledge that russian individuals and companies hit with eu sanctions wont be able to evade them in switzerland which is not one of the eus member states the government said friday that financial intermediaries in switzerland were now banned from starting new business relationships with russian people and four russian companies any existing business must be reported to the swiss economic affairs secretariat further steps are under consideration while hardly a crackdown compared to other western sanctions aimed at punishing moscow for its invasion of ukraine the impact could be felt the rich alpine nation has been the biggest recipient of transactions by russian private individuals ahead of britain spain luxembourg and the united states according to a report compiled by the swiss embassy in moscow switzerland has for years been by far the most important destination worldwide for rich russians to manage their wealth the report said adding that net transfers of russian taxpayers to switzerland totaled billion in the swiss news agency sdaats reported net transfers of billion in the first half of federal councillor guy parmelin the head of the federal economic affairs department noted that switzerland was bound to follow un sanctions but could decide whether to follow eu sanctions based on criteria such as foreign policy and legal aspects including legislation that has enshrined neutrality into swiss law swiss authorities are in essence extending measures set up in after russias takeover of crimea in which they also sought to ensure that eu sanctions were not dodged in switzerland to hundreds more people and businesses but going further switzerland is thus taking a tougher line with regard to russia parmelin told reporters in bern the capital german government spokesman steffen hebestreit said friday that every country decides in a sovereign way about its actions if you were to ask me whether id be happy if switzerland supported the eu sanctions then id clearly say yes however switzerland is also anxious to safeguard its role as diplomatic gobetween for some countries one of which is russia the swiss government represents the interests of the former soviet republic of georgia in moscow and russias interests in tbilisi the georgian capital under an arrangement set up after those two countries broke off bilateral ties during their conflict in its important to the federal council that implementing these measures doesnt cut off talks between switzerland and the countries affected said parmelin switzerland wants to be able to offer its services to the countries in conflict if these countries wish if switzerland were to automatically adopt the sanctions imposed by the eu or other countries it could no longer credibly play the traditional role for which it is valued worldwide he added the respected swiss daily tages anzeiger reported ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy asked his swiss counterpart on saturday to act as a neutral mediator between ukraine and russia and help work toward a ceasefire between the two countries notably in the context of a human rights council meeting in geneva opening monday the swiss foreign ministry did not confirm any such communication

moscow said roughly percent of russias commodities trade goes through the swiss financial services centers of geneva zug lugano and zurich major russian energy and commodities firms have offices in

contradictions of the present have raised the specter of nonalignment in parts of africa asia and latin america most of these countries voted against the condemnation of russia not because they

the leaders of these countriesfrom chinas xi jinping to indias narendra modi to south africas cyril ramaphosahave called despite their very different political orientations for a departure from the

highlighting chinas ambitions towards afghanistan following americas chaotic withdrawal last summer president xi jinping sent a written message pledging beijings continued support for the radical islamic group and the wartorn country which he said stood at a critical point of transition from chaos to order china also welcomed foreign ministers from thailand the philippines myanmar and

lwin was the first to a nonasean country since the coup that brought the ruling junta to power last february and wang told his counterpart that china was ready to help the country address its economic problems which have been compounded by the war in ukraine story continues xi has also weighed in personally on beijings efforts to rally support from its neighbours and developing countries talking to leaders from cambodia indonesia and south africa over the phone recently in a rare move he also reached out to south koreas presidentelect yoon sukyeol twice including a telephone conversation a day after the election even though yoon is strongly prous and has promised to take a tougher stance towards china while china started its pivot to asia after the start of the covid pandemic over two years ago analysts said its recent moves are largely a response to washingtons indopacific strategy a perceived us containment strategy towards beijing wang yi right poses for photos with amir khan muttaqi acting foreign minister of the afghan talibans caretaker government photo ap altwang yi right poses for photos with amir khan muttaqi acting foreign minister of the afghan talibans caretaker government photo ap china has always attached importance and invested heavily in forging ties with its neighbours over the years now with washington making headway in the indopacific region especially in geopolitical and security terms beijing has to ramp up its efforts to shore up and consolidate ties with its peripheral region said li mingjiang an associate professor at nanyang technological universitys s rajaratnam school of international studies in singapore last week us president joe biden told the visiting singaporean prime minister lee hsien loong that the ukraine crisis would not distract washington from implementing its indopacific strategy although a planned white house summit for the leaders of the members of the association of southeast asian nations has been postponed because of scheduling problems biden said he wanted to ensure that the region remains free and open without specifically naming china from chinas perspective the growing us involvement in the indopacific and the resulting changes to the regional geopolitical landscape are alarming li said washingtons ability to garner a united front with europe and nato on ukraine and strengthen its alliances in the region such as the fourway grouping of the quad comprising japan australia and india remains a top challenge for china according to a survey by the iseasyusof ishak institute in singapore early this year washington has gained ground against beijing in their competition for influence in southeast asia over the past year in recent weeks washington has tried to lure nepal a traditional buffer between china and india with an infrastructure grant project while exerting pressure on india over its refusal to denounce russia new delhis top weapons supplier wang made surprise visits to both india and nepal last week despite the two countries ongoing territorial disputes with china at a time of increasing great power competition which has been exacerbated by the russian invasion of ukraine it makes sense for china to go into diplomatic overdrive especially given the us efforts to rally countries against russia said benoit hardychartrand an international affairs specialist at temple university in tokyo he noted the importance of regional diplomacy was not new for beijing as it has long valued stability close to its borders and been working to strengthen its influence on its periphery chinas periphery and southeast asia in particular has long been a locus of great power competition between china the us and even japan according to hardychartrand tensions between the us and china persist and a video meeting between xi and biden did little to alter the situation the us continues to use sanctions and other measures to target chinese firms and offiicals over chinas human rights record and us national security concerns while beijing blames washington for a failure to improve ties despite the crisis in ukraine washington has continued to focus on the competition with china and warned beijing will face consequences if it supports russias invasion but analysts said asian countries reaction to russias attack was also an opportunity for china while most of these countries voted to denounce moscows invasion at the united nations last month singapore is the only one in southeast asia to join the western sanctions against russia the regions top arms supplier huang jing director of the institute of the us and pacific studies at shanghai international studies university said while two un resolutions condemning russia won overwhelming support from over countries it did not mean they agreed with the western sanctions with washingtons attention and resources diverted from the chinafocused indopacific strategy to the ukraine crisis it presents some good opportunities for china to ramp up its influence he said he said beijing should seize on the opening especially indias resentment about pressure from western countries over its close defence ties with russia to pull it away from the quad while it is almost impossible to fully repair chinas ties with india beijings priority should be to prevent new delhi siding with washington in the uschina rivalry and the formation of an asian nato in the indopacific he said referring to beijings categorisation of the quad huang also said it was natural for beijing to shift its focus onto its asian neighbours considering the decline in uschina ties and hardening bipartisan consensus in washington bidens framing of the uschina rivalry as a battle between democracy and autocracy has also left no doubt for leaders in beijing about the prospect for future relations monika chansoria a senior fellow at the japan institute of international affairs in tokyo said the renewed preoccupation of an overstretched us with european security has seemingly provided beijing the strategic space to realign the global world order in order to meet its own strategic targets most importantly taiwan but she said wangs trip to india initiated from the chinese side had failed to yield tangible results and was an failed attempt by beijing to begin portraying that its back to business as usual with india following a deadly border clash in the galwan valley two years ago chinas peripheral region senses the looming threat of china trying to unilaterally change the status quo in the east and south china seas chansoria said the region is wary of beijings predatory expansionism that spreads across small lesserdeveloped nations in dire need of developmental aid and assistance hardychartrand also said it is unclear whether china can overcome notable obstacles including aseans insistence on strategic autonomy yoons prous stance and ongoing tensions with japan to strengthen its influence one of the most significant challenges is that most countries are reluctant to see china become a regional hegemon and continue to want a strong american presence in the region he said

4090,8 takeaways from Bidenâ€™s trip to Europe,by maegan vazquez and kyle feldscher cnn president joe biden used a lastminute trip to europe this week to rally the worlds democracies and announce more actions against russia for its invasion of ukraine while also causing a geopolitical stir with one of the final lines from his speech in poland the presidents fourday stint began in brussels where he attended snap summits and held bilateral meetings with other world leaders biden then traveled to poland where he met with american troops stationed just west of ukraine spoke with humanitarian workers and refugees and held talks with polish president andrzej duda it ended with what will become one of the signature speeches of the presidents career as he evoked european history to make the case for democracy and said russian president vladimir putin cannot remain in power a seismic statement that the white house quickly tried to downplay throughout his visit biden sought to reinforce his broadreaching foreign policy framework discussing his heartbreak about the humanitarian crisis at hand and telling american troops in poland that they were in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs the trip was a test of what the united states could do to rally alliances following years of absent leadership proving to also be an assessment of just how much the western alliances can achieve when they are fully united here are eight takeaways from bidens visit to belgium and poland biden says putin cannot remain in power at the end of his address from warsaw capping off his trip biden made a major declaration that quickly sent shock waves across europe and through the white house press office for gods sake this man cannot remain in power biden announced at the very conclusion of a capstone address delivered outside the royal castle in warsaw for a few moments it appeared to be a clear call for regime change in russia and the kremlin reacted quickly to the presidents words with putins spokesman dmitry peskov saying this is not to be decided by mr biden it should only be a choice of the people of the russian federation however before bidens plane had taken off for washington the white house was already downplaying the comments a white house official said biden wasnt referencing regime change when he said putin cannot remain in power the presidents point was that putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region he was not discussing putins power in russia or regime change a white house official said it was a response that attempted to put the presidents speech in line with larger us policy american officials had said previously that removing putin from power was not their goal for us its not about regime change the russian people have to decide who they want to lead them secretary of state antony blinken said earlier this month a separate white house official told cnn after the speech that the line was not in bidens prepared remarks white house forced to clean up multiple other biden comments that raised eyebrows the line at the end of bidens speech in warsaw will be the one that is longest remembered but it was not the only time that the white house needed to clarify some of the presidents remarks during his fourday swing through europe on thursday during a news conference in brussels biden said the united states would respond in kind if russia used chemical weapons in ukraine when asked by a reporter on friday if that meant the us would use chemical weapons on russia national security adviser jake sullivan said the united states had no intention of using chemical weapons period under any circumstance asked about bidens comments sullivan said the president also said the united states would respond accordingly sullivan added meaning we will elect the form and nature of our response based on the nature of the action russia takes and well do so in coordination with our allies and weve communicated to the russians as the president said publicly a couple of weeks ago that there will be a severe price if russia uses chemical weapons and i wont go beyond that other than to say the united states has no intention of using chemical weapons period under any circumstances on friday in poland biden made an apparent slip by suggesting the us troops he was speaking to would see ukrainians in action biden has made clear that us troops will not fight in ukraine and his remark did not appear to be anything other than a slip the average citizen look at how theyre stepping up and youre going to see when youre there i dont know if youve been there youre going to see women young people standing in the middle of the damn tank saying im not leaving im holding my ground biden said a white house spokesperson responded to the comment saying the president has been clear we are not sending us troops to ukraine and there is no change in that position biden warns the worlds democracies that a time is coming for resolve and unity the end of the warsaw speech will be the most memorable line from an address that widely called for democracies to steel themselves against the threat of autocracies in the years and decades to come biden has often said that the defining battle of the coming era is democracy versus rising autocracies and he said ukraine was the front line in that fight biden standing along natos eastern edge in poland issued a stern warning during his speech telling putin dont even think about moving on one single inch of nato territory he said the us was committed to the collective protection obligations laid out in natos charter with the full force of our collective power in a message to the poles and other nato allies biden used a cold warera cry from the late polishborn pope john paul ii to rally a nation facing new threats be not afraid biden said nothing about that battle for freedom was simple or easy it was a long painful slog fought over not days and months but years and decades biden told the crowd in warsaw we emerged anew in a great battle for freedom a battle between democracy and autocracy between liberty and repression he said the same lessons must be applied to the current threat from russia this battle will not be won in days or months either we need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead biden said biden announces new sanctions and measures to help ukrainian refugees much like other leaders at the summits biden used his meetings on thursday and friday to announce a slew of new actions aimed at punishing russia and aiding ukrainians on thursday his administration issued sanctions against hundreds of russian politicians business leaders and defense companies the new restrictions target members of the seat russian state duma the lower house of the twotiered russian parliament and cut off russian defense and materiel companies from western technology and financing the us also sanctioned herman gref the head of sberbank who has worked with putin since the s when both men worked in the mayors office of st petersburg the us also put sanctions on longtime putin associate gennady timchenko his companies family members and yacht as well as board members of russian financial institution sovcombank according to the white house biden announced that the us will accept up to refugees fleeing the war in ukraine with an emphasis n protecting the most vulnerable among the refugee populations including members of the lgbtq community those with medical needs journalists and thirdcountry nationals a senior administration official said a full range of legal pathways would be utilized to welcome the refugees on friday biden and his counterpart at the european commission ursula von der leyen unveiled a joint task force aimed at weaning europe off its dependence on russian oil and gas the panel is aimed at finding alternative supplies of liquified natural gas and reducing overall demand for natural gas moving forward the united states will work toward supplying europe with at least billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas in in partnership with other nations the white house said russia hits lviv with airstrikes after days of western allies meetings on the war after days of western allies meeting and talking about how to punish putin and russia for the invasion of ukraine the russian military appeared to send a message to biden with an airstrike on a fuel depot in the western ukrainian city of lviv lviv is the city to which many displaced ukrainians have fled and is where many western media outlets have made their home base to cover the war while russian military officials said that they intended to focus their campaign in the disputed eastern parts of ukraine the attack on lviv was conspicuously timed coming just before biden was to speak in warsaw about miles away in poland russian military officials also used the trip as a moment to put their own spin on how the conflict is going russian colonel general sergei rudskoy on friday claimed that russian forces had encircled cities around ukraine in a deliberate effort to tie down ukrainian forces and prevent them from focusing on the separatist regions of donbas before russia liberates them putin has stated that the goal of the conflict is the complete demilitarization of the country and has said that the war is going according to plan however russian forces have incurred serious losses and military analysts and observers say russian advances appear to have stalled around major ukrainian cities such as kyiv and kharkiv following world leaders meetings in brussels putin said in a videoconference with workers of arts and literature on friday that the west was trying to cancel russia jk rowling has recently been canceled because she did not please the fans of the socalled gender freedoms putin who has railed against transgender and gay rights said referring to the harry potter author today they are trying to cancel a whole thousandyearold country our people i am talking about the increasing discrimination of everything related to russia about this trend which is unfolding in a number of western states he added zelensky left frustrated by unmet requests from nato ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky virtually addressed leaders gathered in brussels several times during the summits repeatedly calling them out and asking them to do more to protect his country zelensky told nato leaders that ukraine which is not a nato member needs just a fraction of the alliances combined firepower saying you can give us of all your planes one percent of all your tanks one percent you have thousands of fighter jets but we have not been given one yet he added zelensky argued that nato leaders should acknowledge what ukraines armed forces have demonstrated in the war against russia telling the group please never tell us again that our army does not meet nato standards on another videoconference zelensky asked the g countries how many urgent summits would need to be held until the problems created by russia could be solved calling on the nations to issue a full embargo to trade with russia zelensky separately thanked european council members for putting sanctions on russia but lamented that it was a little late you blocked the nord stream pipeline we are grateful to you and rightly so but it was also a little late because if it had been in time russia would not have created a gas crisis at least there was a chance he told the council speaking to the council zelensky issued pointed remarks to hungary calling on the countrys prime minister viktor orban to decide already on its treatment of russia you hesitate whether to impose sanctions or not and you hesitate whether to let weapons through or not and you hesitate whether to trade with russia or not there is no time to hesitate its time to decide already zelensky said possible russian use of chemical weapons in ukraine looms over summits in brussels biden met with global leaders on how the world would respond if russia deploys a chemical biological or nuclear weapon the use of such weapons would force nato into a new posture officials have acknowledged but exactly how nato would respond to the provocation remains unclear when asked on thursday if the use of chemical weapons in ukraine would trigger a military response from nato biden said it would trigger a response in kind the answer led sullivan bidens national security adviser to clarify that the us response to a potential chemical weapons attack by russia would be done in coordination with allies sullivan would not say what the response would entai but said that russia would pay a severe price and emphasized that the united states has no intention of using chemical weapons period under any circumstances the g issued a warning in its final joint statement against such an action and nato secretary general jens stoltenberg whose tenure was extended a year amid the current crisis said use of a chemical weapon would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict bidens meeting with refugees touches an emotional nerve on the trip biden repeatedly sought to highlight the refugee crisis that has ensued as a result of the war a crisis he saw firsthand when visiting ukrainian refugees on saturday one woman biden spoke with told him she was there with her daughter but her husband and son were back in ukraine fighting the woman via a translator spoke about the horror her family has endured and remarked of putin we ukrainian mothers are ready to strangle him with our bare hands the president also met with chef jos andrs and other volunteers in warsaw at a food distribution site for andrs world center kitchen the nonprofit devoted to providing meals in the wake of disasters biden met with some of the volunteers some from europe and some from the united states god love ya the president could be heard saying to them and asking if he could help them more than million refugees have now fled ukraine according to data from the united nations refugee agency released on tuesday poland a nation that has seen more than million refugees from ukraine enter its borders has sought to get more us resources and flexibility in immigration policies to aid with the influx after meeting with the refugees biden was asked his opinion of putin as he deals with the russian leader every day biden responded hes a butcher during the brief qa session with reporters biden recounted how he had been to similar places in his life but that he is always surprised by the depth and strength of the human spirit its incredible its incredible see all those little children just want to hug just want to say thanks i mean its just makes you so damn proud he said he added each one of those children said something to the effect say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother whos back there fighting and i remember what its like when you have someone in a war zone every morning you get up and you wonder you just wonder and you pray you dont get that phone call upon his arrival in poland on friday biden met with humanitarian workers to discuss their efforts saying he would have preferred to see the crisis from an even closer perspective but was prevented by security concerns they will not let

democracies and announce more actions against russia for its invasion of ukraine while also causing a geopolitical stir with one of the final lines from his speech in poland the presidents fourday stint began in brussels where he attended snap summits and held bilateral meetings with other world leaders biden then traveled to poland where he met with american troops stationed just west of ukraine spoke with humanitarian workers and refugees and held talks with polish president andrzej duda the trip was a test of what the united states could do to rally alliances following years of absent leadership proving to also be an assessment of just how much the western alliances can achieve when they are fully united here are eight takeaways from bidens visit to belgium and poland biden says putin cannot remain in power at the end of his address from warsaw capping off his trip biden made a major declaration that quickly sent shock waves across europe and through the white house press office for gods sake this man cannot remainin power biden announced at the very conclusion of a capstone address delivered outside the royal castle in warsaw for a few moments it appeared to be a clear call for regime change in russia and the kremlin reacted quickly to the presidents words the white house quickly tried to downplay throughout his visit biden sought to reinforce his broadreaching foreign policy framework discussing his heartbreak about the humanitarian crisis at hand and telling american troops that they were in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs white house forced to clean up multiple other biden comments that raised eyebrows including a slip by suggesting the us troops he was to would see the ukrainians in action on friday inpoland a separate white house official told cnn after the speech that the line was not in bidens prepared remarks that the president was not discussing putin power in r russia or regime change a second white house spokesperson said it was a response that attempted to put the presidents speech in line with larger us policy and that it was not about regime change the russian people have to decide who they want to lead them secretary of state antony blinken said earlier this month a separate whitehouse official said biden wasnt referencing regime change when he said putin couldnt remain inpower the

855,A Dissenting View of US Policy toward Russia,i oppose russian president vladimir putins decision to dismember ukraine and i support placing sanctions on russia but i am leery of the political process by which the united states and russia reached this turn of the road which could signal the beginning of a cold war ii the process is sadly reminiscent of how the united states had previously come to a point in its foreign policy where it had no favorable options since the cold wars end american foreign policy has been conducted by responding to todays news to the extent the united states has had a longterm perspective it is the hazy dream first articulated in christian millennial terms by the puritans of an americanled global transformation i wrote about this in a book grand illusion and political scientist john mearsheimer recently described this outlook in the great delusion on the basis of this entirely unrealistic view of the world the us has stumbled into crises that it didnt know it was creating think of the circumstances beginning after the first gulf war that led to our invasion of iraq or think of our conflict with russia over ukraine this conflict over ukraine did not begin in december when the russians began massing troops in fact they had done so before and pulled back but at least thirty years before with the clinton administrations decision to prop up russian president boris yeltsin and at the same time expand nato eastward eventually to russias borders on the plus side clinton recognized that russia was not a natural adversary of the united states on the minus side clinton fantasized that russia and china could be brought into a usled and dominated capitalist world order yeltsin it was imagined would promote capitalist democracy at home and accede to nato expansion and natos war against the serbs russias fellow slavs what happened was that yeltsin with the help from american money and advisors wrecked the russian economy and polity and paved the way for vladimir putin whom yeltsin appointed as his successor at the same time americas moves with nato and the former yugoslavia where the united states made little effort to bring russia in began driving a wedge between the united states and russia as masha gessen has written in the new yorker the air war against kosovo foreshadowed the crisis in the ukraine if you look at what happened over the next administrations you see russia making occasional efforts at cooperation for instance over al qaeda and afghanistan and then over syria and iran and the united states making occasional efforts to reset relations with the country but the us also took steps that were bound to deepen the conflict americas attempt under george w bush to dominate the middle east bushs proposal backed by john mccain and barack obama and ignoring warnings from putin to bring ukraine and georgia into the nato in which precipitated the war in georgia obamas deception of russia and china at the united nations over american intentions in libya and then of course american support for the maidan revolution in ukraine in that forced out elected prorussian leader and replaced him with an administration hostile to russia and the russianspeakers in eastern ukraine that in turn helped inspire russias reclaiming crimea trump played up his friendship with and admiration for putin but his administration continued the obama policies in ukraine these included arming kyivs government against the eastern separatists while the government pressured by rightwing nationalists rejected the terms of the minsk ii agreement reached by french german ukrainian and russian leaders according to this agreement the kyiv government was to grant autonomy to the russianspeaking donbas region trump also pulled out of the inf missile treaty with russia that ronald reagan negotiated in in ukrainians elected a president who revived ukraines hopes for nato membership in response putin and russia have continually upped their ante airing dreams of a greater russia on the one hand and massing troops on the border on the other now with putins recognition of the separatist regimes he has perhaps set the stage for a wider conflict and the united states and its allies in nato would have no choice but to respond with sanctions but sanctions such as those imposed after russia seized crimea are unlikely to deter putin and really draconian sanctions such as those used against iran could plunge europe and the us into a recession the question to ask about this process is this how did we get to the point where we were unable to respond constructively to russian fears of a new encirclement from nato as my former colleague robert wright put it how could american and western european leaders say on the one hand that they did not contemplate ukraine becoming a member of nato and say on the other hand that they would not accede in any way to putins demand at the center of his december communication with biden that nato commit itself to barring ukraines membership the same question could be asked about putins demand that ukraines government abide by minsk ii one could argue that putin was always determined to reincorpoate ukraine into a greater russia maybe but it seems to me that putins pronouncements about ukraines sovereignty last summer and this week were part of his upping the ante against americas unwillingness to discuss his demands about nato and the demands he made of biden the conflict with russia over ukraine would seem to have called for what richard nixon called playing the long ball nixon had played the long ball defied prevailing opinion by going to china earlier french president charles de gaulle one of nixons models had done so by ending frances war in algeria later ronald reagan would do so with mikhail gorbachev in geneva the united states might have stepped back from the years of provocations and resets to propose a grand bargain with russia that would resolve or at least ease the conflict one based perhaps on a neutral ukraine or on the enforcement of the minsk ii agreement perhaps the die was already cast perhaps putin was never amenable to negotiations or perhaps biden and his foreign policy team of former staffers was not up to playing the long ball or perhaps there is still a possibility for a grand bargain i dont know because the exchanges among american european ukrainian and russian leaders remain secret but it seems to me that without such a bargain we could be headed for another foreign policy disaster one that will have repercussions in the united states and western europe as well as in russia and ukraine think war skyrocketing energy prices recession refugees and a russianchinese alliance against the united states and its

2601,"As Biden Seeks More Foreign Oil, World Leaders Won't Take His Calls",in yet another embarrassment for president joe biden on the world stage his attempts to secure more oil from foreign nations have been met with silence as persian gulf countries decline to throw biden and his botched energy policy a lifeline amid recordhigh us gas prices according to new reporting in the wall street journal saudi and emirati royals have signaled they wont help ease surging oil prices so just how embarrassing is this for the supposed leader of the free world well they apparently wont even pick up the phone to talk to biden the white house unsuccessfully tried to arrange calls between president biden and the de facto leaders of saudi arabia and the united arab emirates as the us was working to build international support for countering russias invasion of ukraine and contain a surge in oil prices said middle east and us officials saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman and the uaes sheikh mohammed bin zayed al nahyan both declined us requests to speak to mr biden in recent weeks the officials said as saudi and emirati officials have become more vocal in recent weeks in their criticisms of american policy in the gulf there was some expectation of a phone call but it didnt happen said a us official of the planned discussion between the saudi prince mohammed and mr biden it was part of turning on the spigot of saudi oil woof so president biden the man that he and the white house have sought to portray as the leader organizing global opposition to vladimir putin and his forces bloody invasion of ukraine cant even get people on the phone to talk about how hes going to sustain us energy demands while punishing putin by banning russian oil imports to the us the journals report also notes that the saudis have signaled that their relationship with washington has deteriorated under the biden administration another foreign relationship thats circling the drain despite bidens campaign pledge to renew relations with important leaders around the world see also france and the united kingdom both the saudis and emiratis are also concerned about the revival of the iran nuclear deal which doesnt address other security concerns of theirs and has entered the final stages of negotiations in recent weeks another unsurprising reality that biden or his handlers should have anticipated due to bidens souring relationship with these key oilrich nations both have decided theyd rather stick to their agreements with the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec than even talk with president biden about his proposal to get out of the energy pickle in which hes put the united states making matters worse and even more embarrassing for biden its not like the saudis and emiratis are sitting the whole russiaukraine war thing out as the journal notes both prince mohammed and sheikh mohammed took phone calls from russian president vladimir putin last week after declining to speak with mr biden and they both later spoke with ukraines president so biden is the only one whos been iced out by the saudis and emiratis potentially due in part to their energy alliance with russia one of the worlds top oil producers that has enhanced the power of opec while also bringing the saudis and emiratis closer to moscow that saudi and emirati leaders would decline bidens calls is unsurprising given his previous attempt to secure more oil supplies from foreign producers was equally and and also embarrassingly unsuccessful as townhall reported on august bidens request was rebuffed by opec which denied bidens request for more oil saying that its member countries and its allies including russia conveniently think markets do not need more oil than they plan to release in the coming months despite us pressure to add supplies to check an oil price rise none of bidens undignified begging and subsequent global embarrassment would be necessary had his

3843,Analysis: Why some African countries are thinking twice about calling out Putin,by stephanie busari cnn nelson mandela was once asked why he still had relationships with among others fidel castro and yasser arafat the cuban and palestinian leaders who had been branded terrorists by western powers the revered south african statesman replied that it was a mistake to think that their enemies should be our enemies this stance has largely typified some african nations response to the russiaukraine war across the continent many appear hesitant to risk their own security foreign investment and trade by backing one side in this conflict while there has been widespread condemnation of the attacks on ukrainian civilians and their own citizens fleeing the warzone from countries such as ghana nigeria kenya there has been a much more muted response from some key african nations countries on the continent find themselves in a delicate position and will not want to get drawn into proxy battles says remi adekoya associate lecturer at englands university of york theres a strong strand of thought in african diplomacy that says african states should maintain the principle of noninterference and so they shouldnt get caught up in proxy wars between the east and the west as some states did get caught up in proxy wars during the cold war for instance adekoya told cnn one influential voice that has made it clear he will not make an enemy out of russian leader vladimir putin is south african president cyril ramaphosa while addressing his countrys parliament thursday he said our position is very clear there are those who are insisting that we should take a very adversarial stance and position against say russia and the approach that we have chosen to take is we are insisting that there should be dialogue after initially releasing a statement calling for russia to immediately pull its forces out of ukraine south africa has since laid the blame for the war directly at natos doorstep for considering ukraines membership into the military alliance which russia is against the war could have been avoided if nato had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater not less instability in the region ramaphosa said in parliament thursday former south african president jacob zuma also earlier issued a statement saying russia felt provoked putin has been very patient with the western forces he has been crystal clear about his opposition of the eastern expansion of nato into ukraine and is on the record about the military threat posed to russia by the presence of the forces it looks justifiable that russia felt provoked zuma said in a statement issued by his foundation on march south africa has strong ties to russia and ramaphosa has written about being approached to be a mediator in the conflict given its membership of brics a group of emerging economies comprising brazil russia india china and south africa the ties between the two countries also date back to apartheid times when the former soviet union supported south africa and the african national congress party in their liberation struggles those favors have not been forgotten said adekoya south africa was one of african nations to abstain on the un resolution demanding that russia immediately withdraw from ukraine on march it took a similar stance during putins annexation of crimea in nigeria and egypt were among the african nations that voted to condemn russia while eight others didnt submit a vote eritrea was the only african country that outrightly voted against the resolution zimbabwes foreign ministry said in a statement it was unconvinced that the un resolution was driven towards dialogue rather it poured more fuel to the fire thus complicating the situation strongman leadership many of the countries that abstained from the un vote are authoritarian regimes they see putins unilateral decision to invade ukraine as a show of power and ego that they can appreciate and align with yetunde odugbesanomede a political analyst and professor at new yorks farmingdale state college told cnn one of those who have spoken out prominently in support of the russian leader is lt gen muhoozi kainerugaba the influential son of ugandan president yoweri museveni his father has ruled uganda with an iron fist for years and there has been speculation that kainerugaba is a wouldbe successor when the yearold museveni eventually stands down kainerugaba tweeted that the majority of mankind that are nonwhite support russias stand in ukraine putin is absolutely right some african countries have also hesitated in speaking out against russia because they want to keep their options open if they face existential threats or some kind of revolution in their own country in the future said adekoya they saw putin keep assad in power in syria because if not for russias intervention assads regime would have fallen long ago he added adekoya also pointed out that some of the muted response stems from what is perceived as western hypocrisy kenyas un security council representative martin kimani gave a powerful speech on the brink of russias invasion of ukraine kimani drew a parallel between ukraines emergence as an independent state after the collapse of the soviet union and the experience of postcolonial states in africa criticizing russian presidentvladimir putins buildup of forces and his support for redrawing ukraines borders by recognizing the breakaway statelets of donetsk and luhansk kenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force he said referring to russias recognition of the two territories as independent states we must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression during the speech he also mentioned other nations on the security council who had breached international law and faced no sanctions he didnt mention them by name but he was talking about the us and uk who invaded iraq in and were never really held to account adekoya said there are many people in many parts of the world who would like to see other regions gaining strength and would like to see the end of western domination of the world order putting it simply of course no rightthinking person in africa or anywhere in the world looks at what is going on in ukraine now and thinks that its a good thing but many people do see the hypocrisy he added establishing stronger ties in recent years russia has established itself as one of africas most valuable trading partners becoming a major supplier of military hardware with key alliances in nigeria libya ethiopia and mali africa accounted for of russian arms exports between and according to the stockholm international peace research institute sipri think tank some analysts say the support or noncensure of russia speaks to a wider sentiment in parts of africa that western policy positions do not always work in their favor the message that moscow is pushing is that if you are tired of the paternalistic way the west approaches you we are going to be your security partners it will be a relationship of equals aanu adeoye a russiaafrica analyst at chatham house told cnn unlike many of its european counterparts russia is not a former colonial power in africa and so has a wider scope of opportunity in making soft power moves that aim to challenge western dominance on the continent the soviet union also had client relationships with many african states during the cold war and moscow has looked to revive some of those ties before the invasion russian state media outlet rt announced plans to set up a new hub in kenya with a job ad that said it wanted to cover stories that have been overlooked by other organizations and that challenge conventional wisdom about africa yet africa has often been at the heart of the tussle for influence in the great power competitions between key geopolitical players such as the us china and russia some countries are trying to leverage this position in a variety of ways odugbesanomede explained that tanzania for example has identified the current situation as a chance for its energy industry to profit tanzanias president samia suluhu hassan sees this an opportunity to look for markets to export gas she said tanzania has the sixth largest gas reserve in africa while some african countries will sustain some economic

in the european union ukrainian refugees are being welcomed by european nations like denmark with open arms when there is war in europe and a european neighbor is exposed to what we see in ukraine there is not the slightest doubt in my mind we must help as best we can by welcoming ukrainians on danish soil said mattias tesfaye the danish minister for foreign affairs and integration soon after russia invaded ukraine in late february the danish government is drafting legislation that will suspend asylum rules for ukrainians rasmus stoklund the foreign affairs spokesperson for denmarks ruling social democratic party told cnn they wont be part of the asylum system stocklund told cnn instead the proposed law will make it easier for ukrainians to receive residency permits so they can quickly start in school on an education or in a job according to a statement by the danish immigration and integration ministry this would be in line with the european union granting temporary protection for ukrainians allowing them to enter the bloc without a visa and to choose which country to go to those eligible would be given protected status similar to that of a refugee in any eu country for a oneyear period which may be reviewed in future this is a stark contrast with the eus asylum rules where refugees must ask for asylum in the first member state they entered efforts by the eu to reform this system and help to equitably resettle asylumseekers around the bloc have been unsuccessful but critics are accusing the danish government of hypocrisy since it is currently urging syrian refugees originating from damascus and its surrounding countryside to return there despite the ongoing civil war and the regimes brutal reputation while fighting has subsided considerably in the region around damascus activists say the danish government is actively putting syrians in harms way in a statement to cnn the danish ministry of immigration and integration affairs said all refugees were treated the same regardless of the law on temporary residence permits for persons expelled from ukraine all persons applying for asylum in denmark have the same rights in the danish asylum system it added that about syrians who have been granted a residence permit in denmark since still live in the country but michala clante bendixen the head of refugees welcome denmark which advocates for a streamlined asylum system said the disparity in treatment suggests the government places a higher value on white lives bendixen said the migrant crisis had shown that if people arrive from afghanistan or syria they will be met with suspicion they will be called migrants until they gain refugee status but now we immediately call ukrainians refugees whats the difference its so disappointing and so terrible that people are so limited in their empathy with other human beings in the world she added punitive policies syrianborn siblings dania and hussam who integrated fully into danish society after arriving in the country as refugees in have been caught in denmarks antiimmigrant dragnet say campaigners the pair now in their s and fluent danish speakers have spent the past year in limbo after danish authorities decided not to extend their fathers residency permit which their own visas are linked to they are appealing the decision last year the siblings told cnn they feared that if they had to return to syria they could be punished for turning our backs on the regime hussam also risks being conscripted into the syrian army he said an estimated of the more than syrian refugees who traveled to denmark have been stripped of their residency status by immigration authorities bendixen says while the danish government cannot repatriate syrians as it does not have diplomatic relations with syria it aims to compel them to leave by making denmark as inhospitable a place as possible to live in and covering their travel costs to return say asylum experts in tesfaye the danish minister for immigration and integration defended the policy in a statement to cnn saying that denmark has been open and honest from day one that residence permits for syrian refugees are temporary and that the permit can be revoked if the need for protection ceases to exist the approach of the danish government is to provide protection to those in need of it but when the conditions in their home country have improved former refugees should return to the home country and reestablish their life there tesfaye added those who have exhausted all legal avenues to appeal their lost residency status face being sent to deportation facilities which bendixen describes as openair prisons designed to break people down the centers are partially open which means that occupants are able to move in and out freely but they have to check in every evening have no income and no right to work or study one such center is around four miles from the nearest bus stop making practically impossible for anyone to leave the move is just one of a number of policies by danish authorities that appear to target the countrys nonwhite immigrant community critics say in the government began to control where immigrants lived by forcing social and ethnic change in lowincome housing estates across the country authorities described them as hard ghettos and are defined by danish regulations partly according to the races of residents and as syrians braved treacherous journeys to reach the safety of europe a socalled jewelry bill was rolled out in allowing the government to take certain assets from asylumseekers to contribute to the countrys welfare state we might as well be honest about the fact that we would rather help ukrainian refugees than somalians and palestinians the former liberal party immigration minister inger stojberg whose party pushed through the socalled jewelry bill wrote on facebook on wednesday no one dares to say it like it is its because the ukrainians are more like us and because they are primarily christians stoklund foreign affairs spokesperson for the ruling social democratic party told cnn the jewelry law will not apply to ukrainians as they will not be part of the asylum system if the draft legislation is approved that optout is unfair according to bendixen especially considering the financial burden other noneuropean refugees face in trying to reach safety ukrainians can just travel as tourists into europe since they have enjoyed visafree status in the eu since they dont need human smugglers she explained they dont need to risk their lives on small sinking boats or in the desert to travel safely to europe they will not have to go through the asylum system which is very slow and can easily take a year before you get your case decided despite this descriptions of ukrainian refugees from politicians and in the media could not be more different to the chaotic response to the migrant crisis driven largely by the syrian civil war part of the answer has to do with identity wrote migration and asylum expert lamis abdelaaty on twitter ukrainians are seen as white christian syrians afghans and others are not perceived this way people sympathize with refugees who they think share their race religion etc but identity is not the whole story said abdelaaty an assistant professor at syracuse university in the us state of new york there is a foreign policy dimension to this too it matters that ukrainians are fleeing a russian invasion welcoming them is another way for european countries to condemn putin and to powerfully signal which side of the conflict they are on the migrant crisis saw an estimated million asylumseekers enter europe they were greeted by a skeptical press a rise in antimigrant policymaking as seen in denmark and a rise in support for farright parties following a series of isis terrorist attacks over the following year and now suddenly even more people are arriving in two weeks and everybodys like oh yeah we can handle it and we have lots of space and they should be welcome bendixen said as russian airstrikes become more indiscriminate the united nations said tuesday that the outflow of ukrainian refugees hit million as mainly women children and the elderly seek refuge from the unprovoked aggression those numbers are expected to swell as attacks intensify on a number of key cities and towns the response to russias invasion of ukraine shows that countries like denmark can take in refugees with compassion the color of a refugees skin or their religion should not have any bearing on that

4808,"Putin spokesman's surprising admission: We've taken significant losses, it's a huge tragedy",i didnt expect this but i suppose some realities are so plain that even russia wont bother to dispute them as the photos of burnedout tanks and dead russian troops pile up on social media claiming that losses are minimal would make the kremlin seem ridiculous while failing to convince anyone the most dmitri peskov can do here to spin the state of the war is to say that the countrys troops withdrew from northern parts of ukraine like kiev and chernihiv as a goodwill gesture towards negotiation not because the ukrainians were about to run them off the truth is that if russia had left those troops in place and they had been routed the army might have been too undermanned to mount an effective offensive in the donbas raising the specter of total defeat putin and his advisors likely came to the difficult conclusion that the only way theyd stand a chance of a facesaving win in the east was accepting a difficult defeat in the north and evacuating those troops to fight another day we have significant losses of troops vladimir putins press secretary dmitry peskov says its a huge tragedy to us to have lost russian troops during the war in ukraine sky virgin freeview and youtube pictwittercompghofvdewb sky news april another reason peskov may be willing to concede major losses is because russian citizens are getting glimpses of the truth the brother aleksandr kononov last saw him at the military hospital morgue in the southern russian city of rostovondon in march lieutenant kononov had died in a firefight for a steel plant in the ukrainian port city of mariupol he was walking to the morgue mr kononov recalled he passed the open gate of a warehouse and glimpsed dozens of black body bags lined up on the floor six weeks after president vladimir v putins invasion of ukraine many russians remain in the dark about the depth of their countrys losses and about the carnage and brutal atrocities that their military is inflicting as it retreats in the north but increasingly the reality of war is intruding in the lives of regular families when death notices and black body bags arrive causing some like mr kononov to question the war with war deaths growing word of the dangers of fighting in ukraine is filtering down through the public and there have even been cases of service members trying to avoid combat one lawyer in southern russia says hes received more than inquiries from russian troops and national guardsmen about their legal rights to refuse to deploy to ukraine if ordered but not everyone whos lost a loved one to the war blames moscow one man whose son died recently in combat blamed the ukrainian nazis and their american patrons my personal opinion is we should just whack america with a nuclear bomb and thats it so that they stop getting involved in other countries business whacking america with a nuclear bomb wouldnt stop us from getting involved in russias business rather the opposite but we shouldnt expect a grieving father to think clearly speaking of grief and revenge the ukrainians have been hard at work lately trying to figure out which russian units specifically were responsible for the horrors in bucha theyd identified some culprits on april oleksiy arestovych an adviser to ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy published a list of russian units both military and national guard that he said had been deployed to bucha and two other towns in the kyiv region irpin and hostomel among those he named were the th and th airborne assault regiments of the th airborne assault division based in the northwestern russian city of pskov the division is renowned in soviet and russian military history for both battlefield prowess and brutality during the second chechen war in the early s paratroopers from the th airborne division were credibly accused of killing chechen civilians indiscriminately other circumstantial evidence found in the town like a discarded ammo box also points to the th airborne reportedly a russian soldiers cell phone was also recovered and his social media accounts examined photos on his instagram account show him pictured with members of the th separate motorized rifle brigade after hearing that the ukrainian government published two lists one identifying the officers in that brigade and the other supposedly identifying every last soldier in it a separate hacked list identifying more than russian soldiers by name date of birth passport number and unit was published

3358,UN Security Council meeting again Thursday to debate Ukraine,united nations ap the un security council will meet thursday at the request of six western nations that sought an open session on ukraine ahead of an expected vote on a russian humanitarian resolution that they have sharply criticized for making no mention of moscows war against its smaller neighbor russia is committing war crimes and targeting civilians russias illegal war on ukraine is a threat to us all tweeted the un mission of the united kingdom one of the six countries that requested the meeting the mission posted the flags of the six council nations requesting the meeting the uk us france ireland norway and albania russia circulated a proposed security council resolution tuesday that would demand protection for civilians in vulnerable situations in ukraine and safe passage for humanitarian aid and people seeking to leave the country but without mentioning the war the draft resolution would also underscore the need for the parties concerned to agree on humanitarian pauses to rapidly evacuate all civilians but it never identifies the parties the resolution is expected to be voted on by the council friday russia presented its draft a day after france and mexico announced that a humanitarian resolution on ukraine that they cosponsored was being moved to the member general assembly after two weeks of discussions on the draft in the member security council the francemexico draft resolution would demand an immediate cessation of hostilities and deplore the dire humanitarian consequences of the hostilities against ukraine those provisions are not in the russian text and the francemexico resolution would almost certainly have led to a russian veto if put to a vote in the council britains un ambassador barbara woodward tweeted tuesday that the russian draft has a few glaring omissions for example the fact that russia is the aggressor here and it is russias invasion driving this humanitarian crisis deputy russian ambassador dmitry polyansky responded in a tweet thursday saying good ruse and asking the uk to provide examples where un humanitarian resolutions cited aggressions or invasions russian authorities maintain they did not start the war and have repeatedly decried reports of russian military setbacks or civilian deaths in ukraine as fake news they also denounce reports calling its military operations a war or an invasion state media outlets and government officials insist russian forces target only military facilities despite widespread video footage of civilians and civilian infrastructure including residential buildings and hospitals being hit by russian missiles polyansky tweeted that russia is fully on board with a humanitarian text but said it was clear western council members dont need one mexican ambassador juan ramon de la fuente however told reporters wednesday that he and french ambassador nicolas de riviere were working on taking their humanitarian resolution to the general assembly very soon in the following days he expressed hope the assembly can vote on it this week or next week the russian mission had said a vote on their resolution could take place as early as wednesday but some council members wanted to discuss the text and there was a closed meeting of council experts wednesday morning russia then asked to delay the vote and the united arab emirates which holds the council presidency this month said it is now scheduled for friday olivia dalton spokesperson for the us mission to the united nations said tuesday it was unconscionable that russia the aggressor responsible for creating this crisis would have the audacity to put forward this resolution she said the united states will work with other countries for a general assembly resolution that will more accurately reflect the views of un member states about the impact of russias unprovoked aggression after russia vetoed a westernbacked security council resolution demanding that it stop the war and withdraw its forces from ukraine the sponsors introduced a similar resolution in the general assembly it was adopted march by an overwhelming vote of with countries abstaining unlike security council resolutions general assembly resolutions are not legally binding but there are no vetoes and they do have clout in reflecting

open supporters of neonazi beliefs that view the ethnic russian people in donbass as untermenschen if you dont know that already you have been reading too much western media disinformationmoscow had stuck with a political process for nearly seven years to give peace in ukraine a chance the socalled minsk agreement was never implemented by the kiev regime despite it being a signatory to an international legally binding accord the donetsk and lugansk breakaway regions were not given the autonomy that the minsk deal mandated instead the populations in those regions have been under relentless siege for all these years from the kiev regimethe denial of political and human rights to donbass such as the entitled use of the russian language by kiev and its ongoing military hostility amounted to a campaign of genocide emboldened by us and nato weaponry flooding in as well as by european blindness to violations of the minsk agreements the kiev regime had openly repudiated any peace processit was evident that the escalating violence against the people of the donbass was leading to a blood bath up to civilians have fled the region across the russian border in the last week a state of emergency was declared in both the donetsk and lugansk peoples republics owing to the extreme hostility and duress from power being cut off by acts of terrorism acts of terrorism that were being sponsored by us and nato support no less the western media silence on these crimes is a source of shame if not complicityits easy to be cynical on the basis of misinformation and ignorance western governments and media are now condemning russias president vladimir putin for recognizing the independence of the donbass republics new rounds of western sanctions on russia are forthcoming the nord

russian invasion plans are being proven albeit under the guise of moscow recognizing what was formerly ukrainian territory as independent republicsthat view is made possible by being in a state of ignorance about the reality of conflict in ukraine and the dire humanitarian conditions in donbass western media never reported on the situation with any objectivity or fair concern it had continually maintained the distorted propaganda narrative that russia was supporting a bloody rebellion in donbass as a proxy war against ukrainethe truth is the kiev regime came to power through an illegal coup dtat in covertly supported by the cia and nato powers the new regime was and still is dominated by neonazi factions who immediately turned to aggression against the russian populations of crimea and donbass fortunately crimea was able to escape through a referendum in and join the russian federation which affords national security in western media that is portrayed as russias illegal annexation of crimeathe donbass had to endure nearly eight years of aggression and siege tantamount to genocide with mounting offensiveness by the kiev regime in recent days and outright repudiation of the minsk peace accord russia had no choice but to move to defend the russian people of donbassthis will be twisted and vilified by western media as a russian invasion and undermining ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity but such distortion is only superficially tenable due to the ignorance or indifference of western media about the reality of what has been happening in ukraine over the past eight years and in particular in the donbasssupposedly righteous western governments and media have been supporting a regime whose forces are armed and trained by the united states and nato to carry out a genocidal war against the russian people of donbass that outrage had to be stopped moscows brave decision this week to recognize the donbass republics was a necessity to stop the violencewith the donetsk and lugansk peoples republics now having the support of russia and its military the kiev regime and its nato sponsors will have been given serious pause in their nefarious scheme it didnt have to be this way if the us and its european allies had not interfered in ukraine and emboldened a russophobic regime to wage a civil war but since that had happened and a peace accord was being

russianato row over the indopacific while talking to sputnik during an interviewsputnik in a broader context how do you assess the developments in ukraine which russia says is an attempt to prevent a global wardr zorawar daulet singh this point has been raised by president vladimir putin on several occasions recently when he said the possibility of a major confrontation between russia and usnato would have taken on a very different meaning had ukraine already been a member state of nato putin even raised the spectre of a nuclear crisis in the hypothetical scenario of ukraine inside natos tenttherefore russia is seeking to neutralise ukraines geopolitical status to solve the dangerous security crisis in europe this worrying development since led to a counterreaction by russia firstly that counterreaction led to the integration of crimea after the referendum of its predominantly ethnic russian population to join mainland russia what russia has now done through its ongoing military operations is it has preempted the very possibility of ukraine ever becoming a member state of nato by not only carving out territories that will now become independent states but also by positioning formidable military capabilities on ukraines frontiers that can impose extraordinary pressure on the usnato should they choose to subsequently respond to this particular military operation in a way that attempts to resuscitate the rump state in kiev in the next few weeks if not days the ball will eventually go back into the us court and washington will need to make a call on what to do are they going to negotiate with russia for a new security order or will they continue the old game of russian containment the latter has proven to be a selfdefeating policy because it only produced insecurity in the european continent and also led to an erosion of us hegemony in the international system the past decade makes it clearif the us cuts its losses and stabilises the great power competition with russia i think everyone will be betteroff in europe washington moscow and elsewhere in the worldsputnik the us and its allies like japan and australia have imposed sanctions targeting the military and economic sectors do you think sanctions are the correct way to deal with the crisis as russia has faced multiple sanctions in the past toodr zorawar daulet singh unilateral sanctions are not seen as legitimate by most nonwestern states we often hear the argument that imposing economic costs on russia will persuade it to take a different course yet what we have seen is that the containment of russia including economic containment has actually been going on for a lot longer and far before this crisis in eastern europe had started playing outfrom russian perspective the western policy is not actually aimed at changing russian behaviour in a particular case but its part of a more radical containment geostrategy to keep russia weak isolated and separate from its traditional economic partners in western europe like germany and france for example in the case of the nord stream pipeline connecting russia with germany there have been recurring attempts much before the ukraine crisis to try and block out russian gas to germany and replace that with us lng exports to europe on the whole since russian policymakers have come to accept that economic sanctions are an acceptable cost to bear when it comes to core security and geopolitical interests i think they are going to ride it out and they have ridden it outindeed sections of the russian elite see sanctions as an opportunity to reorient the russian economy towards more domestic innovation and rebuilding parts of the industrial economy that has enormous potential given russias human capital in science and technology over time sanctions could actually have the opposite effect it leads to a stronger russia that is more selfreliant and we hear that specific sectors have already acquired that leveleven germany and other economies in western europe will not sever all their connections with the russian economysputnik how do you view the responses of china and india will western countries buy into the arguments made by the two countriesdr zorawar daulet singh ironically china and india do have similar opinions on the ukraine crisis these asian powers have their own reasons for cultivating and maintaining a deep partnership with moscow both india and china value the strategic partnership with russia for china it provides strategic depth and stability to counterbalance the us in the western pacific and more broadly in the international system for india russia has always played a critical role as a reliable great power friend in an uncertain world whether to manage chinas rise offset the old uspakistan alliance insurance against uschina duopoly and developing indias military strength so it is natural that india and china are going to respond to the ukraine conflict in a measured and restrained way of course both delhi and beijing strongly believe in the concept of sovereignty and territorial integrity but both also see the lead up to this crisis as very much part of a complex history where it was a relentless encroachment by nato after the end of the cold war deeper and deeper into eastern europe and up to a point where it was poised to acquire a member state literally at russias doorstepthere does seem to be a degree of empathy and geopolitical understanding that russia has legitimate security interests with both delhi and beijing recognising the deeper causes and provocations that preceded russias military intervention in ukraineindia has a different level of relationship with the us and the west than china does i do not see the us succeeding in using the ukrainian crisis to diminish indorussian relations or alter them in any significant way that simply wont happenmore broadly indias strategic establishment driven today largely by pragmatic and realistic precepts understands that great powers will intervene in their peripheries indians have also seen interventions by the us in farflung regions of the globe that went beyond any normal definition of security and threats this idea of getting india to bind by certain principles and adopting an antirussia stance will not have much of an impact in new delhisputnik how will this crisis impact the indopacific region as we see the us forming new alliances such as quad and aukus in this regiondr zorawar daulet singh what will be the ripple effects and repercussions of the ukraine crisis in the rest of eurasia and the indopacific this is a significant question and should occupy policymakers in washington today the notion that the us could pursue a policy of containment towards russia at the same time pivot towards asia and the indopacific to manage a rising china and to ensure that asia does not fall under the sway of a new rising power has been the great delusion such a level of ambition was becoming simply unsustainable because the power gap between the us and the rest has been narrowing over the past decadethe us should now ask itself whether further confrontation with russia undermines its broader strategic goals in asia the managing of chinas rise given the ideological proclivities of policymakers in washington in london in brussels it does appear there is a deeper reluctance to change course in recent years the us has been trying to strengthen old alliances and develop new partnerships in the indopacific that are very much centred on managing chinas rise that strategy will certainly face an uphill task if the usrussia crisis leads moscow to deepen ties with china further and take positions in the indopacific that are far more antagonistic to the us russia so far has not extended the level of military strategic activities to truly impact us security or the security of us allies in the indopacific they have been far more measured including in their military exercises with china but should that become an important part of russian security policies it would obviously undermine the us grand strategy in the indopacific ukraine china kiev

decision is affecting russian citizenssputnik meta has always portrayed itself as an inclusive platform opposed to racism and xenophobia what do you make of the media giant actually encouraging hate

socalled private company it is completely inappropriate for meta to change its policies to support us interests and thus act as the right arm of the empire russian citizens are being targeted and are suffering now because of how the mainstream corporate media has spun the issue in ukraine facebook and instagram have ridiculous speech regulations and that is another issue but to allow hate speech against one group of people while protecting another group fosters xenophobia and racism against russianssputnik are they going to get away with this are we looking at any public outcry at alltaylor

fraught with risks the us mainstream media are evaluating the risk of nuclear war americans are panicbuying iodine tablets to counteract the effects of radiation poisoning and sputnik international t t t russias special operation in ukraine us world opinion ukraine nuclear sanctions nato nato expansion javelin i think a lot of people particularly in washington like to remind people of how serious this is if the united states actually confronts the russian federation or if americas allies do says joe siracusa us politics expert and professor of history and diplomacy at curtin university australia president biden went out of his way to say that were not putting a boot on the ground in ukraine because that would be world war iii in the west there is very little understanding of nuclear history since the end of the cold war most media reporters and even universities in the us assume that the end of the cold war also marked the end of interest in nuclear weaponsthe russian special operation to demilitarise and denazify ukraine was launched on february in accordance with article chapter vii of the un charternothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective selfdefence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the united nations until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security the charter readsarticle was invoked by russia after the us nato and the eu unanimously rejected moscows request to provide legalbinding guarantees of natos eastward nonexpansion ukraines nonadmission to the bloc removal of striking systems from russias doorstep as well as the withdrawal of the forces in eastern europe to the positions of in the beginning of the russian special operation some nato member states issued threats to hold russia and belarus accountable for the move and threatened that moscow would pay a price in the wake of the inflammatory rhetoric russias nuclear deterrence forces were put on high alert on february earlier russian president vladimir putin warned nato member states against militarily engaging in the ukraine crisisnevertheless some western policymakers came up with ideas of sending a nato contingent to ukraine and implementing a limited nofly zone in the eastern european state the bold proposals as well as polands plan to transfer mig jets to ukraine via the united states have been scrapped by washingtonthe white house quoted both the threat of a potential nuclear escalation and expressed doubts that additional warplanes would anyhow change the balance of forces on the ground in ukraine meanwhile some us politicians such as senator lindsey graham went even so far as to call for assassinating the russian president prompting a storm of criticism in the us social media over unnecessary escalationmainstream media hype over ukrainian npps putins nuclear cardthere was also hype about russians allegedly attacking ukraines nuclear power stations thus inviting the danger of nuclear collapse and contamination according to george szamuely however it turned out that it was the ukrainian sabotage units who provoked clashes at the zaporozhye nuclear power plant npp on march and attacked the power grid facilities that provide electricity to the chernobyl npp last week both sabotage attempts were repelled by the russian military forces with nuclear reactors and critical infrastructure sustaining no damagetheres yet another fake idea being peddled by the western media which says that russian president putin is getting desperate and might therefore use weapons of mass destruction szamuely notes in particular the new york times quoted exus national security council official fiona hill speculating of putin using a nuclear card nyt also published thomas l friedmans oped which claimed that russia is facing imminent defeat in ukraine and would resort to using nuclear weaponshowever the scholar

says nato being persuaded to deploy troops in western ukraine this is insanity us military expert says following the western press claims that russias ukraine operation has stalled and that moscow may use chemical or bio weapons out of despair us dod sputnik international t t t russias special operation in ukraine us world russia europe ukraine chemical weapons biological weapons nato azov battalion sputnik speaking to maverick multimedia on march you said that russias special operation in ukraine is close to being over in russias favour and that moscows military op will later be studied by specialists whats so special about russias operation in your opinionscott ritter i think the thing that separates the russian special operation in ukraine apart from other military operations of this nature is the fact that russia does not intend to occupy ukraine this is something that the russian leadership has said from the very start a military operation that is designed to occupy is a much more complicated operation requiring significantly more troops it is about holding cities holding roads holding specific geographical areas this kind of focus allows russia to avoid the trap of being compelled to carry out operations to conquer territory instead to focus on a more specific task of eliminating military formations with the goal of eventually leaving ukrainesputnik why are the western mainstream media continuing to claim that russias ukraine operation has stalled does it mean that they do not understand russias strategy and objectives or does this narrative serve some other purposesscott ritter i think there are two reasons why the west is mischaracterising the russian military operation in ukraine first is that the west is evaluating this as if it were russias intent to occupy ukraine from the very start the fact that russia is coming in with only troops makes no military sense when we are speaking of a nation of million people with a combined military capability of around troops the other aspect of the mischaracterisation is that there is an information warfare aspect to this war the west is hopeful that they will be able to use the russian operation in ukraine as a vehicle to motivate domestic political unrest in russia that will at a minimum compel the russian leadership to withdraw from ukraine with its mission unfinished and at a maximum lead to the overthrow the removal of the russian president and the russian government sort of a colour revolution if youd like to say so in order to do this they are creating a picture of a military disaster in ukraine on the part of the russian military and theyre trying to project this narrative of a military disaster back into russia in an effort to demoralise the russian population and provide the impetus for massive popular demonstrations against the russian governmentsputnik western pundits politicians and experts are speculating about russias possible chemical attack in ukraine they have not presented evidence that russia possesses such weapons nor provided any proof that such plans exist what could be the primary purpose of this narrativescott ritter the current narrative being put out by western leaders and the western media about the russians preparing a chemical weapons attack in ukraine is born of the standard reaction when one side is caught doing something that they shouldnt have been doing and they seek to project blame onto the other side there is no doubt in my mind that the russians are not preparing a chemical weapons attack this makes no sense from both a military and political standpoint plus it presumes the existence of a militaryscale chemical warfare capability in russia that russia simply doesnt possessbut what has happened is that russia has discovered biological research facilities inside ukraine operated by the united states department of defense and theyve discovered certain research activities which are difficult to explain by the united states that could have offensive biological warfare capacity and the united states is embarrassed by this so its deflecting the narrative back on to russia and in doing so they expand the narrative based upon past allegations that russia supported chemical weapons used by the syrian government in syria that russia used chemical agents against the skripal family in the united kingdom that russia used chemical agents against the political dissident navalny in russia and therefore because russia is guilty of all three of these things russia is preparing to use chemical weapons in ukraine its an absurdity its ridiculous but its part and parcel of the ongoing information warfare campaign being waged by the west against russiasputnik nato has been increasing its military presence along its eastern borders since the beginning of the russian special operation in ukraine whats behind this military buildup in your opinionscott ritter the ongoing nato buildup on its eastern flank i believe is an exercise in confidencebuilding on the part of nato we are talking about an organisation that has just gone through in this past summer a terribly demoralising withdrawal from afghanistan one that made it question its relationship with the premiere power in nato the united states and question the ongoing viability of nato as a military alliance i mean what is the purpose of nato the russian incursion into ukraine has breathed new life into those who believe that there is an ongoing purpose to nato but it is one thing to say nato is relevant it is another thing to make nato relevant and one of the things we know about nato in the past decade or so is that it is militarily impotent it doesnt have viable military capacitythere are ongoing discussions in brussels right now in the emergency summit that nato has convened about the possibility of putting natos peacekeeping forces into western ukraine you know this is insanity under any circumstances nato does not have the ability to do this and prevail but again theyve assembled these forces theyre looking in the mirror they think they like what they see and they think that theres real muscle there and who knows they may be compelled to believe that they have more capability than they really do and try to project these forces in the west of ukraine in which case there will be unfortunately a military clash between nato and russiasputnik what are the odds of nato troops getting involved in the ukraine conflictscott ritter if someone had asked me at the beginning of the russian incursion into ukraine what are the odds of nato getting involved i would say zero because nato had made it clear that it was not going to get involved in any fight between ukraine and russia on ukrainian territory but as this conflict goes on as millions and millions of ukrainians seek refuge in nato countries were now looking at an economic and humanitarian catastrophe for nato and there are now people talking about not just imposing a nofly zone but actually putting nato peacekeepers on the ground in western ukrainei dont think nato is going to make the decision today to send peacekeepers in but i do think this issue is being discussed and will be tabled for consideration at a later date and that later date could come sooner rather than later if more and more refugees
