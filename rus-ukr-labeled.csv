8071,"Refugees, reporting and the far right: how the Ukraine crisis reveals brutal â€˜everyday racismâ€™ in Europe and beyond","Please be advised this article features accounts of racism and racist discourse, including mentions of Nazism.

The intensifying conflict in Ukraine has raised the issue of racism not only in Ukraine, but Europe. Three specific and related dimensions of racism are evident in this complex conflict.

Discrimination against African and Asian nationals fleeing Ukraine

Shocking reports emerged in the past week of discrimination faced by African and Asian nationals (mainly international students in Ukraine) who were among the over 1 million people seeking refuge in neighbouring Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Moldova.

African and Asian people were forcibly prevented from boarding trains and buses leaving Ukrainian cities, as priority was given to white Ukrainians. Those who finally reached the Polish border (some even on foot) found that again white Ukrainians were prioritised entry. Some African, Asian, and Middle-Eastern nationals were met by verbal and physical abuse on arrival.

Many African, Asian, and Middle Eastern nationals spent two to three days at border check-points, and reported lack of food, water, accommodation or basic support in freezing winter conditions, while they waited to get through.

A statement issued by the African Union condemned reports about the treatment of Africans as â€œshockingly racist and in breach of international lawâ€ and observed:

all people have the right to cross international borders during conflict, and as such, should enjoy the same rights to cross to safety from the conflict in Ukraine, notwithstanding their nationality or racial identity.

Racist mainstream media portrayals

Equally disturbing is the unthinkingly racist mainstream media framing of Ukrainian refugees, in comparison to the framing of refugees from Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan or Africa.

Below, a selection of such racist commentary from major news outlets:

â€œThis isnâ€™t Iraq or Afghanistan [â€¦] This is a relatively civilised, relatively European cityâ€ - Charlie Dâ€™Agata, CBS

â€œWar is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populationsâ€ - Daniel Hannan, The Telegraph

â€œWhatâ€™s compelling is looking at them, the way they are dressed. These are prosperous, middle-class people. These are not obviously refugees trying to get away from the Middle East [â€¦] or North Africa. They look like any European family that youâ€™d live next door toâ€ â€“ Peter Dobbie, Al Jazeera

These descriptions of Ukrainian refugees invidiously position them as more â€œcivilisedâ€ and â€œsuperiorâ€ to refugees from the Middle East, African or Asian nations. This seems to imply that Ukrainian lives are worth saving, while the lives of millions of others who seek refuge are more disposable because they are people who are not â€œwell-dressedâ€, â€œmiddle-classâ€, donâ€™t â€œlook like usâ€, or live in more remote, supposedly less â€œcivilisedâ€ locations.

White-supremacist Ukrainian mobilisation

The third and more dangerous dimension of racism is the mobilisation of the neo-Facist, white supremacist Azov movement in Ukraine since 2014. Azov started as a volunteer battalion that was then officially integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine in November 2014. The current Ukrainian government has not made comment on this movement.

In the current crisis, Azov battalion is training Ukrainian civilians for guerrilla-style combat with the Russian military.

However, it is important to also note that similar white nationalist groups exist across Europe and North America. Therefore Putinâ€™s claim of â€œde-Nazificationâ€ of Ukraine is a flimsy reason for invasion of Ukraine.

While the Azov battalion officially denies adhering to white supremacist ideologies, Azovâ€™s street patrol called National Militia were responsible for attacks on Roma in Ukraine in 2018.

Azov also plays a pivotal role in the global network of far-right, white-nationalist extremism; it â€œparticipated in training and radicalising United Statesâ€“based white supremacy organizationsâ€ (according to a 2018 FBI affidavit).

Closer to home, alongside other European far-right movements, Azovâ€™s propaganda appears to have inspired Brenton Tarrant of Australia in his deadly terrorist attack on a mosque in Christchurch in 2019. This was evidenced by the sonnerad or black sun on his jacket, a symbol commonly used by the Azov Battalion and far-right brands in France.

What accounts for these three dimensions of racism in the Ukraine crisis, and how are they connected?

Research suggests racism and xenophobia varies with the relationship between hostile government policies and anti-migrant sentiments of the population. In short, the problem of racism is not just Ukrainian or eastern European, it is European.

More nuanced analysis argues there is insufficient evidence to show eastern Europeans are more xenophobic than western Europeans. Any analysis should consider the complex histories of migration from, and through eastern European countries.

Indeed, as the global news coverage of Ukrainan refugees demonstrates, everyday racism - or what Goorie author Melissa Lucashenko refers to as â€œwhite normal savageryâ€ is not restricted to eastern Europe. All three dimensions of racism discussed here are the manifestation of global, systemic institutionalised racism and imperialism.

Acknowledgement of this institutionalised racism and imperialism would begin by first recognising the Ukraine crisis as a power struggle between the US/NATO and Russia, underwritten by interests of weapons manufacturers and oil companies. This crisis was long predicted by strategic observers of global politics.

Recognising the wider context of institutionalised racism would allow us to connect the current racist treatment of African and Asian migrants in the Ukraine crisis to deadly European border policies over the past decades. These policies have led to increasing numbers of migrants mostly from Africa and the Middle East, reported as missing in the Mediterranean since 2014.

Azov needs to be recognised as the belligerently violent face of a racialised political order that is potentially dangerous. However, this would require holding the US accountable for its suspected support of Azov, and its refusal (along with Ukraine) to condemn the glorification of Nazism in a UN Resolution in 2017.

Finally, we should recognise that any moves to dismantle institutionalised racism are unlikely to be undertaken voluntarily. As Professor of Sociology JÃ³zsef BÃ¶rÃ¶cz argues, the defining element of â€œwhitenessâ€ is a â€œclaim, indeed demand, for unconditional global privilegeâ€ that is always being reconstituted.",https://theconversation.com/refugees-reporting-and-the-far-right-how-the-ukraine-crisis-reveals-brutal-everyday-racism-in-europe-and-beyond-178410,Neutral
1794,Nord Stream 2 pipeline operator lays off employees following sanctions,"The Nord Stream 2 pipelineâ€™s operator has laid off its employees in the wake of sanctions against the natural gas pipeline and lobbyists who have since canceled their contracts with the operator.

â€œFollowing the recent geopolitical developments leading to the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company had to terminate contracts with employees. We very much regret this development,â€ the operator said in a statement, according to Reuters.

A Swiss official also confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that all of the operatorâ€™s 106 employees had been let go, adding that â€œcontinued employment is no longer possible due to the payment difficulties.â€

The development comes less than a week after President Biden announced the United States would be sanctioning the Russian parent company of the pipeline, Nord Stream 2 AG, and its executives after Russia sent troops into Ukraine.

The pipeline has already been completed, but was pending regulatory review before it could be used.

â€œThese steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russiaâ€™s actions in Ukraine. As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate,â€ the president said last week.

Since then, lobbyists in Washington, D.C. â€” Roberti Global and BGR Group â€” have canceled their contracts with the pipeline, a further blow to its business. Spokespeople for both firms said they were doing so in compliance with the announced sanctions.

A host of other companies and organizations have announced divestments, modified services and bans in connection to Russiaâ€™s invasion in Ukraine.

Among the most prominent moves were energy companies Shell and BP pulling out of Russia.

â€œRussiaâ€™s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region. bp has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues,â€ BP Chairman Helge Lund said in a statement Monday announcing it would be divesting from Russian oil company Rosneft.

â€œHowever, this military action represents a fundamental change. It has led the bp board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue,â€ Lund added.

2854,"Internet Research Agency Appears To Be Back, Pushing Propaganda","This story first appeared at ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Just before 11 a.m. Moscow Standard Time on March 1, after a night of Russian strikes on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, a set of Russian-language Twitter accounts spread a lie that Ukraine was fabricating civilian casualties.

One account created last year, @Ne_nu_Che, shared a video of a man standing in front of rows of dark gray body bags that appeared to be filled with corpses. As he spoke to the camera, one of the encased bodies behind him lifted its arms to stop the top of the bag from blowing away. The video was taken from an Austrian TV report about a climate change demonstration held in Vienna in February. But @Ne_nu_Che claimed it was from Ukraine.

â€œPropaganda makes mistakes too, one of the corpses came back to life right as they were counting the deaths of Ukraineâ€™s civilians,â€ the tweet said.

Eight minutes later, another account, @Enot_Kremle_Bot, tweeted the same video. â€œIâ€™M SCREAMING! One of the â€˜corpsesâ€™ came back to life during a segment about civilian deaths in the Ukraine. Information war is reaching a new level,â€ they said.

Two other accounts created last fall within a few days of @Enot_Kremle_Bot soon shared the same video and accusations of fake civilian casualties. â€œUkrainian propaganda does not sleep,â€ said one.

The Twitter profiles are part of a pro-Putin network of dozens of accounts spread across Twitter, TikTok and Instagram whose behavior, content and coordination are consistent with Russian troll factory the Internet Research Agency, according to Darren Linvill, a Clemson University professor who, along with another professor, Patrick Warren, has spent years studying IRA accounts.

The IRA burst into the American consciousness after its paid trolls used thousands of English-language accounts across social media platforms to influence American voters during the 2016 presidential election. The IRA was at the center of a 2018 Department of Justice criminal indictment for its alleged effort to â€œinterfere with elections and political processes.â€

â€œThese accounts express every indicator that we have to suggest they originate with the Internet Research Agency,â€ Linvill said. â€œAnd if they arenâ€™t the IRA, thatâ€™s worse, because I donâ€™t know whoâ€™s doing it.â€

An analysis of the accountsâ€™ activity by the Clemson Media Forensics Hub and ProPublica found they posted at defined times consistent with the IRA workday, were created in the same time frame and posted similar or identical text, photos and videos across accounts and platforms. Posts from Twitter accounts in the network dropped off on weekends and Russian holidays, suggesting the posters had regular work schedules.

Many of the accounts also shared content from facktoria.com, a satirical Russian website that began publishing in February. Its domain registration records are private, and itâ€™s unclear who operates it. Twitter removed its account after being contacted by ProPublica.

The pro-Putin network included roughly 60 Twitter accounts, over 100 on TikTok, and at least seven on Instagram, according to the analysis and removals by the platforms. Linvill and Warren said the Twitter accounts share strong connections with a set of hundreds of accounts they identified a year ago as likely being run by the IRA. Twitter removed nearly all of those accounts. It did not attribute them to the IRA.

The most successful accounts were on TikTok, where a set of roughly a dozen analyzed by Clemson researchers and ProPublica racked up more than 250 million views and over 8 million likes with posts that promoted Russian government statements, mocked President Joe Biden and shared fake Russian fact-checking videos that were revealed by ProPublica and Clemson researchers earlier this week. On Twitter, they attacked jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and blamed the West for preventing Russian athletes from competing under the Russian flag in the Olympics.

Late last month, the network of accounts shifted to focus almost exclusively on Ukraine, echoing similar narratives and content across accounts and platforms. A popular post by the account @QR_Kod accused the Ukrainian military of using civilians as human shields. Another post by @QR_Kod portrayed Ukraine as provoking Russia at the behest of its NATO masters. Both tweets received hundreds of likes and retweets and were posted on the same day as the body bag video. At least two Twitter accounts in the network also shared fake fact-checking videos.

The findings indicate that professionalized trolling remains a force in domestic Russian propaganda efforts and continues to adapt across platforms, according to Linvill.

â€œI canâ€™t stress enough the importance of understanding the way that this is a tool for Putin to control narratives among his own people, a way for him to lie to his own people and control the conversation,â€ Linvill said. â€œTo suggest that the West is blanketly winning this information war is true only in some places. Putin doesnâ€™t have to win the information war, he just has to hold his ground. And these accounts are helping him do that.â€

After inquiries from ProPublica, all of the active accounts were removed from TikTok, and nearly all were suspended by Twitter. Meta said it removed one Instagram account for violating its spam policy and that the others did not violate its rules. None of the platforms attribute the accounts to the IRA. Twitter and TikTok said the accounts engaged in coordinated behavior or other activity that violated platform policies.

A TikTok spokesperson said the initial eight accounts shared with it violated its policy against â€œharmful misinformation.â€ TikTok removed an additional 98 accounts it determined were part of the same pro-Putin network.

â€œWe continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation,â€ said a statement provided by the company. â€œWe also partner with independent fact-checking organizations to support our efforts to help TikTok remain a safe and authentic place.â€

TikTok removed at least three additional Russian-language accounts that Clemson researchers said are part of the same network. The company declined to say how many accounts in total it removed as part of this action.

A Twitter spokesperson called the roughly 60 accounts it removed â€œmaliciousâ€ and said they violated its platform manipulation and spam policy, but declined to be more specific. They said the company had determined that the active accounts shared by ProPublica had violated its policies prior to being asked about them. Twitter decided to leave the set of 37 accounts online â€œto make it harder for bad actors to understand our detections,â€ according to the spokesperson.

The accounts were removed by Twitter within 48 hours of ProPublica contacting the company about them. The week before, Twitter removed 27 accounts that the Clemson researchers also identified as likely IRA accounts.

â€œOur investigation into these accounts remains ongoing, and we will take further action when necessary,â€ said a statement from a Twitter spokesperson. â€œAs is standard, when we identify information operation campaigns that we can reliably attribute to state-linked activity, we will disclose this to the public.â€

Twitter declined to offer more details on why it left roughly 30 accounts that it identified as violative online to continue spreading propaganda. It also declined to comment on connections between the roughly 60 accounts in this recent network and the hundreds of accounts flagged by Linvill and Warren last spring as possible IRA profiles. Linvill said he identified the recent accounts largely based on their commonality with the previous set of 200.

â€œI connect these current accounts to the ongoing activity over the course of the past year by carefully tracking accountsâ€™ tactics, techniques and procedures,â€ he said.

Platforms may be hesitant to attribute activity to the IRA in part because the agency has adapted and made its efforts harder to expose, according to Linvill. But he said social platforms should disclose more information about the networks it removes, even if it canâ€™t say with certainty who is running them.

â€œIn every other area of cybersecurity, dangerous activity from bad actors is disclosed routinely without full confidence in the source of the activity. We name and disclose computer viruses or hacker groups, for instance, because that is in the public interest,â€ he said. â€œThe platforms should do the same. The Russian people should know that some sophisticated and well-organized group is covertly using social media to encourage support for Putin and the war in Ukraine.â€

The Internet Research Agency is a private company owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian entrepreneur known as â€œPutinâ€™s Chef.â€ Prigozhin is linked to a sprawling empire ranging from catering services to the military mercenary company Wagner Group, which was reportedly tasked with assassinating President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The IRA launched in St. Petersburg in 2013 by hiring young internet-savvy people to post on blogs, discussion forums and social media to promote Putinâ€™s agenda to a domestic audience. After being exposed for its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA attempted to outsource some of its English-language operations to Ghana ahead of 2020. Efforts to reach Prigozhin were unsuccessful.

But it never stopped its core work of influencing Russian-speaking audiences. The IRA is part of a sprawling domestic state propaganda operation whose current impact can be seen by the number of Russians who refuse to believe that an invasion has happened, while asserting that Ukrainians are being held hostage by a Nazi coup.

Prior to the invasion, accounts in the network identified by the Clemson Media Forensics Hub and ProPublica celebrated Russian achievements at the Olympics.

â€œThey were deep in the Olympics, tweeting about Russian victories and the Olympics and how the Russians were being robbed by the West and not allowed to compete under their own flag,â€ Linvill said.

After the invasion began, they moved to unify people behind Putinâ€™s war.

â€œIt was a slow shift,â€ he said. â€œAnd this is something Iâ€™ve seen from the IRA before: When a significant world event happens, they donâ€™t always know immediately how to respond to it.â€

By late February, the network had found its voice in part by echoing messages from Russian officialdom. The accounts justified the invasion, blamed NATO and the West and seeded doubts about civilian death tolls and Russian military setbacks. When sanctions kicked in and Western companies began pulling out of Russia, they said it was good news because Russian products are better. (Two Twitter accounts in the network shared the same video of a man smashing an old iPad with a hammer.)

â€œThese accounts were sophisticated, they knew their audience, and they got engagement far surpassing the number of followers that they had,â€ Linvill said.

Paul Stronski, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, reviewed content shared by more than two dozen of the Twitter accounts prior to their suspension. â€œA lot of this is the type of stuff I would expect from Russian trolls,â€ said Stronski, who reads and speaks Russian.

He said many of the accounts adopt an approachable and humorous tone to generate engagement and appear relatable to younger audiences present on social media.

â€œTheyâ€™re very critical of prominent Russians who have criticized this war, questioning their patriotism,â€ Stronski said. â€œTheyâ€™re saying in effect that during wartime you shouldnâ€™t be criticizing your own. You should be lining up behind the state.â€

When President Biden flubbed the pronunciation of â€œUkrainiansâ€ during his recent State of the Union address, several of the accounts on Twitter, TikTok and Instagram shared the clip and mocked him. While that clip spread widely outside of the suspected IRA network as well, the accounts often spread more obscure content in coordination. Multiple Twitter accounts, for example, shared a screenshot of a Russian actorâ€™s tweet that he cared more about being able to use Apple Pay than the war in Ukraine. The accounts criticized him, with one warning that â€œthe internet remembers everything.â€

Before the account takedowns, the Russian government had begun closing off the country from global social media and information sources. It restricted access to Twitter and blocked Facebook. The Russian legislature passed a law that allows for a 15-year sentence for people who contradict the official government position on the war. As a result, TikTok announced it would pause uploads of new videos in Russia.

Some of the accounts in the network saw the writing on the wall and prepared their audience to move to Telegram, a Russian messaging service.

â€œFriends! With happiness Iâ€™d like to tell you that I decided to make the t.me/enot_kremlebot channel, in which you will see analytics to the fullest extent. Twitter could block us any minute!â€ tweeted @Enot_Kremle_Bot on March 5. â€œI really donâ€™t want to lose my treasured and close-to-my-heart audience!

7972,"Zelensky calls on Congress to implement no-fly zone, block purchases of Russian oil","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky participated in a call with a bipartisan group of more than 280 members of Congress on Saturday morning, during which the lawmakers said he laid out ways the U.S. could help his countryâ€™s fight against Russia.

Over Zoom, Zelensky requested additional airplanes, a stoppage of oil purchases from Russia and the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace.

Both Democrats and Republicans lauded Zelensky after their virtual meeting and pledged to do what they could to assist Ukraine.

â€œHonored to hear from @ZelenskyyUa as he takes every measure to defend Ukraine from illegal Russian aggression & Putinâ€™s indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Zelenskyyâ€™s resilience & commitment to the people of Ukraine inspire the world. Proud to stand with you Mr. President,â€ the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tweeted.

Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmed in a statement that Zelensky had asked for either a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace or planes for Ukraine.

â€œUkraine needs airpower urgently and America should send it. Zelenskyâ€™s message is simple: â€˜close the skies or give us planes.â€™ Letâ€™s be clear-eyed about our options: A No-Fly Zone means sending American pilots into combat against Russian jets and air defenses â€” in a battle between nuclear powers that could spiral out of control quickly,â€ Sasse said.

â€œBut Americans should absolutely send Ukrainians planes, helicopters, and UAVs. Letâ€™s resupply Ukraineâ€™s Air Force today and keep the Ghosts of Kyiv in the skies.â€

A no-fly zone is instituted to stop nations from carrying out attacks over groups of people or flying in certain areas.

The Biden administration balked at declaring a no-fly zone over Ukraine, arguing that the move could easily escalate a the Russia-Ukraine conflict into a wider war.

Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) also voiced support to supply Ukraine with planes.

â€œPresident Zelenskyy made a desperate plea for Eastern European countries to provide Russian-made planes to Ukraine. These planes are very much needed. And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer,â€ he said in a statement.

Several senators also noted Zelensky asked for the U.S. to stop Russian oil and gas imports to further cripple the countryâ€™s economy. Russia accounts for 10 percent of the crude oil global supply, the third-largest producer behind the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.

â€œPresident @ZelenskyyUa said stopping the purchase of Russian oil and gas around the world would be one of the most powerful sanctions possible, â€˜even more powerful than SWIFT,â€™ â€ Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) tweeted.

â€œ.@POTUS, enough is enough. Listen to this brave President and a growing bipartisan group of senators. Block imports of Russian oil and gas TODAY, and produce more oil and gas from America. #StandWithUkraine #BanRussianImports,â€ he added.

Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, called on Congress to pass millions of dollars in humanitarian and economic aid for NATO and Ukraine.

Zelensky â€œunderscored the urgent need for more military support and humanitarian aid from his Western partners,â€ Coons said in a statement.

â€œThis call to action must lead to swift passage by Congress of the $10 billion in emergency supplemental aid that I have been calling for to give Ukraine and our NATO allies additional military, economic and humanitarian aid to respond to increasingly brutal Russian attacks on civilians and the rapidly growing humanitarian crisis in Eastern Europe,â€ he continued.

The call with U.S. lawmakers comes over a week after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have fought fiercely against the Russian military, slowing its efforts to capture the countryâ€™s major cities.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that Zelensky had detailed â€œnumerous examples of war crimesâ€ committed in Ukraine.

â€œThere were numerous examples of war crimes provided by President Zelensky â€“ mayors have been captured, imprisoned and murdered. Thereâ€™s wholesale attacks on civilian targets, random, indiscriminate, and the Putin war machine, in my view, is in full blown war crimes mode,â€ Graham said in a video message posted on Twitter after the call.

â€œPresident indicated that labeling Putin a war criminal is the right thing to do, and he thinks would help tremendously.â€

The remarks come as roughly 1.3 million people have fled Ukraine since Feb. 24, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency. The conflict has sparked some leaders to consider waiving travel requirements in order to handle the serious humanitarian crisis.

330,Ukraine: the problem with copying Finlandâ€™s strict cold war neutrality,"During the tense negotiations over the Ukraine crisis, the idea of â€œFinlandizingâ€ Ukraine has been suggested as a solution. This idea refers to the way a small or weak country can retain its sovereignty by making some policy decisions â€“ generally defence and foreign â€“ subject to considerable influence by a more powerful neighbour.

It applied originally to the situation Finland found itself in during the cold war when faced with threats from the Soviet Union. Finland enforced a strict neutrality, remaining outside both Nato and the Warsaw Pact. By these means, it avoided invasion or occupation by Soviet forces.

The idea surfaced when the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was reportedly asked by a reporter in Moscow recently whether Finlandization would work for Ukraine. He replied: â€œYes, it is one of the options on the table.â€ He has since denied the report.

Ukraine has made no secret of its wish to join Nato and the EU, both of which demonstrate its leaning towards the west. If he did indeed suggest Finlandization, Macron and his advisers appear to be proposing that Ukraine would have no choice but to accept Moscowâ€™s control of some of its policies.

Comparisons can be drawn between this crisis and that of Czechoslovakia in 1938, with Britain and France negotiating over Czechoslovakia in an attempt to avoid war with Germany over its territorial ambitions there. The situation is strikingly similar â€“ the potential imposition of an agreement on an unwilling state, stripped of the ability to realistically defend itself from an aggressive neighbour.

The consequences could be similar. What guarantees could be provided by Russia that are acceptable, and more importantly believable, by the west? Unrest by ethnic Russians living in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Georgia to rejoin the motherland would be an obvious next step to further destabilise Nato and extend the crisis beyond the attention span of the western public.

Accommodation, or appeasement, then becomes the order of the day. The additional implication of such actions is that Ukraine would be further dismembered as regions within it assert independence with Russiaâ€™s assistance.

Bloc party

European governments do not want to return to the days of â€œspheres of influenceâ€ â€“ however large or small. So what does that mean for Nato? Ukraine is a sovereign nation, and under international agreements it can choose to become a member of an organisation if it wishes.

The Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership between Ukraine and the Russian Federation was signed in 1997. Both nations agreed to â€œrespect each otherâ€™s territorial integrity and reaffirm the inviolability of the borders existing between themâ€. This was terminated by Ukraine in 2019.

EPA-EFE/Russian Defence Ministry

Russia maintains a large military force on the border of Ukraine and has deployed troops on exercise to Belarus. By deploying these forces, Putin knowingly raised the stakes politically and militarily. Russia considers Natoâ€™s eastern expansion as a breach of an agreement. In September 1990, Gorbachev signed the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, which saw the reunified Germany a full sovereign state and Nato member.

The discussions between the US and Russian Federation following the break-up of the Soviet Union are remembered very differently in Moscow and Washington. Gorbachev remembered that: â€œThe Americans promised that Nato wouldnâ€™t move beyond the boundaries of Germany after the Cold War.â€ The US secretary of state, James Baker, in his account of his discussions with Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze reports having stated: â€œThere would, of course, have to be ironclad guarantees that Natoâ€™s jurisdiction or forces would not move eastward.â€

But this assurance was centred around the Soviet fear of a resurgent, and possibly nuclear-armed, Germany. Robert Zoellick, a US State Department official involved in the negotiations says very clearly that no formal commitment was made to limit Natoâ€™s expansion.

Western divisions

According to the BBC: â€œA source at the Ã‰lysÃ©e Palace said Russia had made a commitment not take any new military initiatives to enable a potential deescalation.â€ This is tantamount to agreeing that Russia is in control of this crisis and will increase or decrease tension at its discretion.

On February 8, Russiaâ€™s defence ministry announced six amphibious landing ships were heading to the Black Sea on exercise. As Putin applies greater pressure on Ukraine, a state he says is historically and culturally one with Russia, the position of Nato and Russia is increasingly polarised. The Russian position is to demand guarantees that Ukraine will not be allowed to join Nato â€“ a position that both the US and Nato have flatly rejected.

The US president, Joe Biden, has stated that all nations must have freedom of action when deciding to form or join an alliance, and that Nato has an â€œopen doorâ€ policy to any European state that qualifies for membership. Ukraine does not presently qualify because of concerns over corruption, economic and democratic reform, and its inability to contribute to the collective defence of Nato. But Biden has made the US position very clear.

Europe has been less clear â€“ eastern European nations are bolstering their military forces and some nations are sending military aid. Meanwhile, Germany refuses to sell arms and equipment to Ukraine and France is discussing a purely political solution. Sanctions against Russia are discussed with varying degrees of enthusiasm in the EU and Nato. It is on this difference in stance that Putin can exert more pressure.

2866,"Hmmm: EU calls for ""pause"" in Iran nuclear talks over ... ""external factors""","Which â€œexternal factorsâ€ might have spooked the European Union from the return of the Iran deal they pushed over the last five years? Vladimir Putin certainly counts among them. But does Joe Biden as well?

Whatever the cause, the sudden stop in momentum toward an agreement came as a surprise:

The European Union foreign policy chief has said that talks in Vienna to resurrect the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and global powers should be paused because of â€œexternal factorsâ€. â€œA pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors,â€ said Josep Borrell on Twitter on Friday at the end of a week in which western officials had hoped a deal would be announced. The Islamic republic has been in indirect talks with the US, brokered by the EU, for the past 11 months. â€œA final text is essentially ready and on the table,â€ added Borrell. â€œAs coordinator, I will, with my team, continue to be in touch with all . . . participants and the US to overcome the current situation and to close the agreement.â€

The fact that this pause came out of the EU seems rather significant, especially since it looked as though Biden and his team were sprinting toward a complete capitulation. Former State Department official Gabriel Noronha has tried to get Congress involved by publishing leaks from within the negotiations passed along by his career contacts at Foggy Bottom in an effort to stall the surrender. It was going so well for Russia, Iran, and China that Putinâ€™s interlocutor openly bragged about it last week to reporters:

Shocking video: This is the lead Russian negotiator for the Iran nuclear talks, Mikhail Ulyanov. He's bragging about how Russia, Iran, and China teamed up to deliver huge wins for Iran's nuclear program in Vienna negotiations. pic.twitter.com/oiTOgfh99i â€” POLARIS (@polarisnatsec) March 6, 2022

â€œIran got much more than it could expect. Much more â€¦ Our Chinese friends were also very efficient and useful as co-negotiators.â€

Remarkably, though, the EU didnâ€™t balk at Ulyanovâ€™s brag. Instead, the issue is likely Sergei Lavrovâ€™s eleventh-hour demand that the new Iran deal allow Russia to sell and purchase oil through Tehran. At that, the EU and the US finally said nyet:

Eleven months of talks to restore the deal which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme have reached their final stages. But last Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov unexpectedly demanded sweeping guarantees that Russian trade with Iran would not be affected by sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine â€“ a demand Western powers say is unacceptable and Washington has insisted it will not agree to. â€¦ Tehran on Thursday suggested there were new obstacles to reviving the deal. Washington underlined that it had no intention of accommodating Russiaâ€™s demands, which it has said have nothing to do with the Iran talks.

Why did Lavrov toss this wrench into the works at the last minute? Putin likely foresaw oil-related sanctions coming down the pike at some point and thought the Iran deal would be too valuable to scuttle for the EU and Biden. Instead, the West started to squeeze on oil, albeit incrementally at first, and made it clear that it wouldnâ€™t provide Russia with an escape valve even to get the really bad deal with Iran that Western nations want for some reason.

However, one has to wonder whether the EU might have lost some confidence in Bidenâ€™s negotiating team after the Ulyanov brag a week ago. Robert Malley leads the US team, a notoriously anti-Israel figure that has circled around Democratic administrations since the 1990s. Alert readers will recall that Barack Obama had to fire Malley from the 2008 campaign after his meetings with Hamas came to light, only to formally rehire him in 2014 to handle Middle East relations â€¦ including, presumably, the negotiations that led to the first Iran deal in 2015. And we already know that Malleyâ€™s work on this deal had produced not just no results before now but also a resignation in apparent protest to Malleyâ€™s approach to the Iranians in 2021.

The EU wants trade with Iran, but they donâ€™t want a nuclear Iran as a result. One has to wonder whether the US might have already given away too much. Scratch that â€” Noronhaâ€™s contacts already establish that point. The question is whether itâ€™s too much even for the EU to swallow â€” and whether theyâ€™re worried that Bidenâ€™s desperate enough for the Iran deal that he might capitulate on Russiaâ€™s sanctions evasion as well as Iranâ€™s.",https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2022/03/11/hmmm-eu-calls-for-pause-in-iran-nuclear-talks-over-external-factors-n454645,Neutral
4435,Russian Attack Aircraft With Nuclear Weapons On Board Violate Swedish Air Space as Sweden Mulls NATO Membership,"One thing Vladimir Putinâ€™s premeditated and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has accomplished is to strip away any illusion that Russia is much more than an ineffectual bully. The prime example of this is how Putin has repeatedly waved about the threat of nuclear weapons. It started very early (Putin Orders Russian Nuclear Forces on Alert Status as His Ukrainian Adventure Stalls), and Biden inexplicably fell for it (Joe Bidenâ€™s Defense Department Cancels a Long-Scheduled Missile Test Because of Offending the Russians They Need for an Iran Nuclear Deal). Putin has since continued to make nuclear threats on at least a weekly basis (here | here),

One incident was when Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zarahova seemed to threaten Sweden and Finland with a nuclear attack if they joined NATO.

Russia just threatened military consequences against Finland and Sweden.

They f***** insane. pic.twitter.com/w4BfHfYYEW â€” Femi (@Femi_Sorry) February 25, 2022

Russia threatened â€œmilitary and political consequencesâ€ against Finland and Sweden on Friday if they attempted to join NATO. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova warned against other countries attempting to join NATO after Russia started a war with Ukraine Thursday. â€œFinland and Sweden should not base their security on damaging the security of other countries and their accession to NATO can have detrimental consequences and face some military and political consequences,â€ Zakharova said in a viral clip of a press conference. The ministry later posted the same threat on its Twitter. Finland and Sweden have given significant military and humanitarian support to Ukraine since Russia invaded.

A story that is happened shortly after this threat is only now finding its way into the media.

Two Russian planes that violated Swedish airspace earlier this month were equipped with nuclear weapons, it has emerged. The flyover near the island of Gotland on March 2 was a deliberate act designed to intimidate Sweden, according to Swedish news channel TV4 Nyheterna. A total of four planes had taken off from the Russian air base of Kaliningrad. They consisted of two Sukhoi 24 attack planes, which were escorted by two Sukhoi 27 fighter jets. It was the two attack planes which were, according to TV4 Nyheter sources, equipped with nuclear weapons. The violation of Swedish territory lasted for about a minute. The countryâ€™s air force deployed two JAS 39 Gripen which took pictures of the intruders. It was then, say Swedish media, that it was confirmed the Russian planes were equipped with nuclear warheads. â€˜This is a signal to Sweden that we have nuclear weapons and we could also consider using them,â€™ military strategic expert Stefan Ring told TV4 Nyheter. â€˜We assess it as a conscious action. Which is very serious especially as [Russia] is a warring country,â€™ added Air Force Chief Carl-Johan EdstrÃ¶m. â€˜I can not rule out incorrect navigation, but everything indicates that it was a deliberate act. That they violated Swedenâ€™s borders.â€™

Weâ€™ve known about the violation of airspace since it happened. However, the revelation of the nuclear weapons is new.

There are three things of note here. First and foremost, the decision to fly nuclear-armed aircraft into another nationâ€™s airspace cannot be a mistake, and it is probably an event unique in the military history of the world. Second, the fact that the Swedish Chief of the Air Force did not bat down the story confirms its truthfulness. Third, there is only one reason I can think of that would inspire the Swedes to make this information public.

In that post, I point out that Finland and Sweden, which are not part of any military alliance, have borders with Russia, and they are in an area where Russia is trying to establish dominance.

7029,"Kremlin rejects â€˜unfounded accusations,â€™ says it takes time to wind down exercises","Russia on Thursday accused the U.S. and NATO of making â€œunfounded accusationsâ€ after Western officials said Moscow has made no effort to withdraw its forces from near the Ukrainian border, as promised earlier this week.

The Kremlin claimed it had a clear timetable for units to return to their permanent bases after it completes military exercises and that such a wind down takes time, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a reporters, as reported by Reuters.

â€œItâ€™s clear the grouping for the [military] exercises was built up over many weeks, and it is of course impossible to withdraw it in a single day. They canâ€™t just take off and fly away . . . it takes time,â€ Peskov said. â€œAs always unfounded accusations.â€

Russia on Tuesday said that it would withdraw a portion of the more than 150,000 troops it has massed near Ukraineâ€™s border, and that it was willing to engage in diplomacy, a move to ease fears of a Kremlin invasion of Ukraine.

But Western officials have said theyâ€™ve seen no such actions and instead witnessed additional troops being sent to the border.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said earlier Thursday that the steps Russia has taken near the border do not suggest that it is â€œready to pack up and go home.â€

In an adjacent press conference, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance also had seen â€œno sign of withdrawal or de-escalation so farâ€ from Moscow.

Moscow has maintained it never planned to invade Ukraine and has said the huge number of the troops at the Ukrainian border in both Russia and Belarus was to hold military exercises and to bolster against provocations from NATO.

But U.S. and alliance officials have warned Russia may stage a provocation in eastern Ukraine as an excuse for a large-scale invasion, much like when it invaded and annexed the Crimea Peninsula in 2014.",https://thehill.com/policy/defense/594681-kremlin-rejects-unfounded-accusations-says-it-takes-time-to-wind-down,Neutral
6358,Blinken announces $215 million in new emergency food assistance for Ukraine,"By Kylie Atwood, Haley Burton and Devan Cole, CNN

The US will give Ukraine an additional $215 million in emergency food assistance to help the country battle the humanitarian crisis brought on by Russiaâ€™s invasion, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Wednesday, as he called on other countries to swiftly act in order to tackle the growing global food crisis.

â€œToday, given the urgency of the crisis, weâ€™re announcing another $215 million in new emergency food assistance, and weâ€™ll do much more,â€ Blinken said at the United Nations during a ministerial meeting on global food security. â€œWe expect our Congress very soon to approve approximately $5.5 billion in additional funding for humanitarian assistance and food security.â€

Blinken also said that the US would be committing $500 million to boost US production of fertilizer. The new assistance comes as there is an increased need for fertilizer in countries that typically got it from Russia, which is the worldâ€™s largest exporter of fertilizer. The cost of fertilizer, essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops, has also risen as output in Europe has plunged due to the surging price of natural gas â€” a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.

Blinken called on other countries that have fertilizer and grain, which is also facing global shortages because of the war in Ukraine, to quickly pitch in to alleviate the effects of the crisis.

â€œThe cost of doing business for vital organizations like the World Food Programme, the Food and Agricultural Organization, UNICEF and others, the cost of doing business is going up. We have to help them continue to do their business,â€ Blinken said.

â€œIn particular as well, countries with significant grain and fertilizer reserves, as well as those with financial resources, need to step up and do it fast. The United States has announced more than $2.3 billion in new funding for emergency food assistance to meet global humanitarian needs since Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine,â€ the secretary added.

The US has made it clear it intends to provide long-term support to Ukraine and has already provided the nation with billions of dollars in military and humanitarian assistance.

Earlier this month, President Joe Biden announced an additional $150 million worth of security assistance to Ukraine in the form of â€œadditional artillery munitions, radars, and other equipment.â€ The new security assistance package follows the Presidentâ€™s $33 billion proposal last month to Congress to support the country.

Last week, the President blamed Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine for domestic price hikes and global food supply shortages, citing the millions of tons of Ukrainian crops that are not being exported because of the invasion.

9542,Are These Satellite Images War Propaganda?,"â€œIf the way that you make your money is through conflict and war, then youâ€™re going to be looking for opportunities to become involved in conflict and war.â€

Those viewers will also never see a complete picture of global military activity. Maxar does not show U.S. troop movements to the public but often releases images of U.S. adversaries like China and Iran. The result is an asymmetrical view of geopoliticsâ€”one that, according to Cory Wimberly, an associate professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley who wrote a book about corporate propaganda, is a kind of manufactured siege mentality. In this scenario, news consumers are led to believe that the U.S. is constantly under threat and in need of military solutionsâ€”which, not incidentally, requires the military to use more of Maxarâ€™s services. Jablonsky has said that the company is â€œhopeful for a peaceful resolutionâ€ in Ukraine. But it is also positioning its offerings to support the Defense Departmentâ€™s pivot â€œfrom anti-terror missionsâ€ to confrontations with â€œlarge, near-peer adversariesâ€â€”namely, Russia and China. â€œIf the way that you make your money is through conflict and war, then youâ€™re going to be looking for opportunities to become involved in conflict and war,â€ Wimberly said.

Satellite imagery is a substantial part of Maxarâ€™s business, which also includes the design and manufacturing of satellites and spacecraft components. In 2021, Maxarâ€™s Earth Intelligence capabilities generated $1.1 billion in revenueâ€”nearly 62 percent of the companyâ€™s total revenues. In addition to its contracts with the U.S. government and its allies, the company also works with nongovernmental organizations and for-profit companies. (Google Maps and Google Earth, for instance, rely on Maxar satellite imagery.) The company doesnâ€™t publicly disclose how much of its revenue comes from providing satellite imagery specifically to defense customers. But according to a recent Maxar annual report, the â€œloss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary contractsâ€ with governmental entities would â€œmateriallyâ€ reduce the companyâ€™s revenue.

Amid the crisis in Ukraine, that possibility doesnâ€™t seem likely. Maxarâ€™s profile, in fact, is looking rosy lately, according to Rich Smith, a contributing analyst for The Motley Fool who focuses on the defense and aerospace industry. On February 28, shares of Maxar Technologies spiked 13.5 percent, and there was â€œno obvious newsâ€ to explain the jump, Rich wrote, â€œexcept for the most obvious of all: Crisis in Ukraine.â€ According to Smith, the proliferation of Maxar images of Russian troops boosts the companyâ€™s name recognition, which is likely capturing the attention of investors. In a February 22 earnings call, Jablonsky acknowledged that the company had in the past â€œseen benefits from geopolitical events of the type weâ€™re seeing now heating up.â€ Asked whether the uptick in press involving satellite imagery in the â€œcurrent geopolitical environmentâ€ had presented â€œany new opportunities or benefitsâ€ on the â€œcommercial sideâ€ for Maxar, Jablonsky praised the companyâ€™s chief marketing officer and the News Bureau team, noting that while the â€œsituation itself is tough,â€ their work has highlighted â€œthe importance of the types of services and products we provide as well as the quality and accuracy of the data that weâ€™re doing.â€",https://newrepublic.com/article/165910/maxar-ukraine-russia-satellite-images-war-propaganda,Neutral
9867,Investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine underway; Minnesota law professor explains process,"President Joe Biden last week called for Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes and said heâ€™ll seek more sanctions against Russia after what he described as â€œoutrageousâ€ atrocities around Kyiv.

â€œThat term is enormously powerful, it has a deep historical resonance, we think of Nuremburg when we hear the word â€˜war crime,'â€ said Fionnuala NÃ­ AolÃ¡in, a regents professor of law, public policy and society, and the faculty director at the Human Rights Center at the University of Minnesota.

Before coming to the U of M, NÃ­ AolÃ¡in worked for the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in Bosnia in 1996 and 1997, focusing on war crime cases.

â€œPolitical leaders can be very visible during a conflict, but as to the question if they have responsibility for crimes, thatâ€™s been really historically difficult to prove in courts of law,â€ NÃ­ AolÃ¡in said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the Russians of gruesome atrocities in Ukraine and told the United Nations Security Council last week that those responsible should immediately be brought up on war crimes charges in front of a tribunal like the one established at Nuremberg after World War II.

The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court at The Hague opened an investigation a month ago into possible war crimes in Ukraine.

Prosecutors need to look for evidence that a commander knew about a soldierâ€™s actions, the professor added.

â€œProof of command responsibility is really hard,â€ NÃ­ AolÃ¡in said. â€œYou have to demonstrate the commander knew or should have known exactly what was happening â€” sufficient to make him or her responsible for that crime.â€

The deliberate targeting of civilians can be a war crime under international law.

â€œProving that crime in a court of law, like any crime, involves evidence,â€ NÃ­ AolÃ¡in said. â€œThat can be particularly difficult to do when a crime has been committed during the course of a war.â€

3443,Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway is making a huge bet on this oil company,"By Paul R. La Monica, CNN Business

The Oracle of Omaha is making an even bigger bet on a major oil company as crude prices continue to surge.

Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate and investing firm run by billionaire Warren Buffett, increased its ownership stake in Occidental Petroleum to nearly 15% this week.

Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in a regulatory filing earlier this month that it had about a 9% stake in Occidental Petroleum.

Thatâ€™s on top of a previous deal that gives Berkshire the right to buy nearly 84 million more Occidental Petroleum shares. Berkshire first invested $10 billion in Occidental in 2019 to help the company buy rival Anadarko Petroleum.

Shares of Occidental Petroleum shot up about 7% Thursday, making them the best performer in the S&P 500. Occidental Petroleumâ€™s stock has now nearly doubled in 2022.

Berkshireâ€™s stock rose about 2% as well Thursday. Its shares have risen nearly 15% this year and are trading at a record high.

Berkshire, along with top energy stocks, has benefited from skyrocketing oil prices in the wake of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. Crude prices are now up more than 35% this year and are above $100 a barrel.

The Occidental investment adds to Berkshireâ€™s already significant position in the energy industry. Berkshire has a massive energy subsidiary that owns leading electric utilities such as PacifiCorp and MidAmerican, oil and natural gas pipelines and several renewable power companies.

Greg Abel, the Berkshire vice chairman who oversees Berkshire Energy and the companyâ€™s other non-financial businesses, was tapped last year to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire CEO.

Berkshire also has a stake in oil giant Chevron, which lost a bidding war to Occidental for Anadarko in 2019.

673,"White House says Russia behind cyberattack on banks, ministry in Ukraine","The Biden administration believes Russian government hackers were behind cyberattacks targeting Ukraineâ€™s Ministry of Defense and banks in Ukraine earlier this week, a top White House official said Friday.

White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology Anne Neuberger told reporters the U.S. believes that hackers working with Russiaâ€™s military intelligence directorate, or GRU, are responsible for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks reported in Ukraine this week.

Neuberger said the Biden administration has â€œtechnical informationâ€ linking the attacks to the GRU and the U.S. shared underlying intelligence supporting the attribution with Ukraine.

â€œWe have assessed that Russia was responsible for the distributed denial-of-service attacks that occurred earlier this week,â€ Neuberger said.

Neuberger added that the U.S. worked to attribute the attacks quickly because of the need to call Russia out for its behavior.

â€œThe speed with which we made that attribution â€¦ is very unusual,â€ she said. â€œAnd weâ€™ve done so because of a need to call out the behavior quickly, as part of holding nations accountable when they conduct disruptive or destabilizing cyber activity.â€

Neuberger said the â€œlimitedâ€ attacks could be consistent with an effort by Russia to lay the groundwork for more disruptive cyberattacks on Ukraine.

Ukraine reported the cyberattacks earlier this week amid fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine and said Russia was the likely culprit.

Biden administration officials have warned that Russia could launch a cyberattack on Ukraine in tandem with or instead of an invasion.

The U.S. has estimated that Russia has between 169,000 and 190,000 military personnel in and around Ukraine, including troops positioned at its border with Ukraine, in Belarus and in Russian-occupied Crimea.

Neuberger said Friday that the U.S. has been helping Ukraine prepare for disruptive or destructive cyberattacks against Ukraine by Russia in the event of an invasion.

She said the U.S. believes Russian hackers have likely been targeting Ukraine government networks both to collect intelligence and to lay the groundwork for carrying out cyberattacks.

â€œThese disruptive cyber operations could be leveraged if Russia takes further military action against Ukraine,â€ Neuberger said.

Russia has increasingly used cyberattacks as an asymmetric tool against the U.S. and other countries, including Ukraine.

President Biden said earlier this week that his administration was prepared to respond to Russian cyberattacks against the U.S. or its allies.

â€œIf Russia attacks the United States or our Allies through asymmetric means, like disruptive cyberattacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,â€ he said during a speech at the White House.

Neuberger said that the U.S. has been preparing for potential cyberattacks against the U.S., Ukraine and other allied countries since November. She noted there are currently â€œno specific or credible cyber threats to the homeland.â€

9040,Russia-Ukraine War Headed for a Bloody Stalemate,"The frontlines in Russiaâ€™s war against Ukraine have barely moved for more than a week. There is some indication that Russia is in the midst of a resupply mission to its troops, but the simpler explanation is that Ukraine has throttled the Russian advance in all sectors and that Putin is either going to have to direct more resources to the war or alter his objectives.

Western intelligence experts are guessing when they say Russia is suffering about 1,000 casualties a day. Ukrainian government numbers are even more shocking. While there are indications that some of the combat has been incredibly intense, Russia has probably not had 24,000 troops killed or wounded in the 24 days since the invasion.

But according to the respected Institute for the Study of War, a D.C. think tank, Russiaâ€™s failures have led to a stalemate scenario that could be vicious and bloody.

The culmination of the initial Russian campaign is creating conditions of stalemate throughout most of Ukraine. Russian forces are digging in around the periphery of Kyiv and elsewhere, attempting to consolidate political control over areas they currently occupy, resupplying and attempting to reinforce units in static positions, and generally beginning to set conditions to hold in approximately their current forward positions for an indefinite time. Maxar imagery of Russian forces digging trenches and revetments in Kyiv Oblast over the past several days supports this assessment.[1] Comments by Duma members about forcing Ukraine to surrender by exhaustion in May could reflect a revised Russian approach to ending this conflict on terms favorable to Moscow.

Thatâ€™s the only way that Putin will stop fighting; when he has terms favorable to Moscow. That means tens of thousands of civilian casualties and destroyed Ukrainian cities. It also means a bloody nose â€” and perhaps worse â€” a humiliation for the Russian military.

The World War I battles of the Somme, Verdun, and Passchendaele were all fought in conditions of stalemate and did not break the stalemate. If the war in Ukraine settles into a stalemate condition Russian forces will continue to bomb and bombard Ukrainian cities, devastating them and killing civilians, even as Ukrainian forces impose losses on Russian attackers and conduct counter-attacks of their own. The Russians could hope to break Ukrainiansâ€™ will to continue fighting under such circumstances by demonstrating Kyivâ€™s inability to expel Russian forces or stop their attacks even if the Russians are demonstrably unable to take Ukraineâ€™s cities. Ukraineâ€™s defeat of the initial Russian campaign may therefore set conditions for a devastating protraction of the conflict and a dangerous new period testing the resolve of Ukraine and the West. Continued and expanded Western support to Ukraine will be vital to seeing Ukraine through that new period.

As long as Zelenskyy feels that Biden and NATO have his back, he will resist. Heâ€™s certainly not going to get favorable terms from Putin. Russia will probably occupy some Ukrainian territory when the fighting stops, and Zelenskyy may be forced to accept the notion of neutrality.

The scenario of a stalemate would be bad for Putin but catastrophic for Ukraine. If he gets the chance, Zelenskyy will end the war as quickly as possible.",https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/rick-moran/2022/03/20/russia-ukraine-war-headed-for-a-bloody-stalemate-n1568022,Pro-Russian

5724,Tucker SLAMS Pentagonâ€™s â€˜Misinfoâ€™ Partnership with Biased NewsGuard,"â€œItâ€™s a censorship organization.â€ On Thursday, Tucker Carlson slammed the Pentagonâ€™s $750,000 contract with leftist ratings firm NewsGuard on his Fox News show Tucker Carlson Tonight.

Carlson reported on the outlandish contract between Bidenâ€™s Pentagon and leftist online â€œcredibilityâ€ arbiter NewsGuard. â€œBidenâ€™s Pentagon, another group with guns, awarded a $750,000 contract to a group called NewsGuard,â€ Carlson began. â€œNow, that contract is for â€˜misinformation fingerprints.â€™â€

NewsGuard is not to be trusted, however, as Carlson elaborated. â€œNewsGuard is an organization that claims to fight â€˜misinformationâ€™ but, in practice, itâ€™s a censorship organization, [it] targets anyone who challenges the people in power.â€

NewsGuard is yet another organization getting involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, too. â€œNewsGuard is currently preparing a black list of sites that contradict the national security stateâ€™s talking points on Ukraine and Russia,â€ Carlson said.

Carlson quoted The Gray Zone editor Max Blumenthal to hammer home just how untrustworthy NewsGuard is as an objective judge. â€œSo this week NewsGuard wrote a threatening email to the news site Gray Zone, informing The Gray Zone that theyâ€™re spreading â€˜disinformation,â€™ â€™cause theyâ€™re not reading the script,â€ Carlson explained.

He quoted Blumenthal, â€œâ€˜Do you seriously expect us to grovel for approval from the same tentacle of the national security state and financial oligarchy that has rated CNN as a highly credible news source, and whose board of advisors is a grotesque gallery of corporate propagandists, spooks, documented liars, war criminals who have never faced a scintilla of accountability for their actions?â€™â€

The language isnâ€™t as much exaggeration as it seems, as Carlson noted. â€œKind of overheated language. Is it true? Yeah, every word of it,â€ Carlson said emphatically. â€œSo when Joe Bidenâ€™s censors come, thatâ€™s the way you respond. â€˜Hey pal, up yours. You want some disinformation? Here you go.â€™â€

Carlson concluded, â€œYou are a free person in a free country and no law enforcement agency can ever tell you what to think or say. Period.â€

NewsGuard boasted about the Pentagon partnership in a 2020 press release, saying it shows how a â€œHuman Intelligence Solution Can Work with AI Toolsâ€ through â€œMisinformation Fingerprintsâ„¢.â€

MRC Free Speech America found that the ratings firm is heavily biased in favor of leftist outlets. A recent MRC study showed that outlets rated â€œleftâ€ or â€œlean leftâ€ by AllSides received an average NewsGuard score of 93/100. Sites considered â€œrightâ€ or â€œlean rightâ€ by AllSides had an average NewsGuard rating of 66/100. NewsGuard even rated several Chinese state-run media outlets higher than several U.S. conservative or pro-life outlets.

Contact ABC News (818) 460-7477, CBS News (212) 975-3247 and NBC News (212) 664-6192 and demand they report on NewsGuardâ€™s clear left-wing bias.",https://newsbusters.org/blogs/free-speech/catherine-salgado/2022/04/29/tucker-slams-pentagons-misinfo-partnership-biased,Neutral
9913,Trudy Rubin: The only way to end Putinâ€™s war crimes is to help Ukrainian forces win,"The gruesome images of slain civilians in Bucha and other liberated towns near Kyiv have been met with furious rhetoric from Western politicians.

Yet there is only one way to stop Vladimir Putinâ€™s forces from committing more hideous war crimes.

It is not by placing more sanctions on Russia (though they are welcome). It is not the suspension of Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council (it should be suspended from the U.N. General Assembly). And it is not â€œpeaceâ€ talks that Putin permits primarily to fool some European leaders.

Putin can only be stopped if Washington and NATO allies provide Ukraine with all the weapons it needs to defeat Russian forces. The critical battles will happen in the coming weeks in eastern Ukraine, as soon as Russian forces recoup from being pushed back from Kyiv.

Yet the most critical weapons systems and vehicles have yet to arrive.

â€œHow many Buchas have to take place for the West to do what we are asking?â€ Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, asked plaintively at an emergency NATO meeting on Thursday.

That is the question NATO members need to answer â€” now.

In fairness, more Western weapons are pouring in every day, and the United States has committed $1.7 billion in defense aid to Ukraine this year. (Ukrainians tell me they are grateful Donald Trump is no longer president, since he justified Putinâ€™s annexation of Crimea and praised the Russia leaderâ€™s â€œgeniusâ€ at the beginning of the current invasion. Trumpâ€™s open disdain for Ukraine and for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his affinity for Putin have not been forgotten in Kyiv.)

Still, U.S. and NATO aid has ramped up much too slowly. In a bitter tweet, the anti-Russian chess star and opposition activist Garry Kasparov argues: â€œThe issue with Western response hasnâ€™t changed since Putin first invaded Ukraine in 2014: Horrified by what has happened, unwilling to act to stop it while it is happening, unable to plan so it doesnâ€™t happen again.â€

Each week, as NATO countries face more outrages by Putin, they up the ante with weapons delivery, but they always appear behind the need of the moment.

U.S. deliveries of Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger short-range antiaircraft missiles have been essential in helping Ukraine hold off the Russians and remain critical. But the systems necessary to defeat Moscow in upcoming battles still havenâ€™t arrived.

Ukraine has been unable to close the skies to the missiles and bombs that have ravaged Kharkiv, Mariupol, and other cities. Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Greece have Russian-made S-300 anti-missiles systems, but have not been willing to loan them to Ukraine unless the United States is willing to loan those countries comparable systems in the meantime.

Nor has Kyiv received the anti-ship missiles it needs, immediately, to help save the port city of Odesa, even though the United States, Norway, and Poland have such systems.

â€œThe [U.S.] bureaucracy simply hasnâ€™t been told that itâ€™s wartime,â€ I was told by the former deputy secretary general of NATO, Alexander Vershbow. â€œThe MiG 29s [airplanes] havenâ€™t moved, long-range air defenses havenâ€™t moved. Itâ€™s so frustrating. The pipeline of weapons is moving very slowly at a time when Russians are more vulnerable than they will be in a few weeks,â€ said Vershbow, also a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, by which time the Russians will be capable of â€œfixing their performance.â€

Indeed, as I have been speaking this week with Ukrainian friends and contacts in Kyiv, I have heard the same message over and over: â€œWe are expecting Putinâ€™s forces to come back here after they regroup in Belarus.â€

That means the next few weeks are crucial, as Russian troops reorganize â€” and as many Russian soldiers, troops, and mercenaries move toward eastern Ukraine for a big land battle in the Donbas region. The Czech Republic has offered Ukraine desperately need tanks, but Ukrainians worry whether they will get there in time.

The Ukrainians believe Putinâ€™s current goal is to expand Russian occupation of big swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine, finally taking Mariupol and maybe Odessa, then enter into inconclusive peace talks that drag on for years. Ukraine would be left with a rump state, cut off from the sea, its infrastructure and economy destroyed, unable to join NATO or the European Union.

Flush with â€œvictoryâ€ in Ukraine, Putin could then set his sights on territory in East European states and the Baltics, unconvinced that Washington would stand by their side.

On the other hand, a Ukrainian win in eastern Ukraine â€” a victory that delivers Russian troops another huge blow â€” would force Putin to rethink his strategy as his military flounders further.

But Ukraine canâ€™t win unless we and NATO allies treat their war with Russia with the urgency weâ€™d muster if U.S. troops were involved, giving Ukraine the tools for protecting their skies as well as winning land battles.

Indeed, Ukraineâ€™s war is our war. If a vengeful, expansionist Putin, backed by China, is permitted to smash Ukraine, the United States will face a Eurasian alliance of dictators who believe they are tougher than Western democracies. And Russian war criminal Putin will almost surely challenge NATO forces (including ours) in the coming years.",https://lacrossetribune.com/opinion/columnists/trudy-rubin-the-only-way-to-end-putin-s-war-crimes-is-to-help-ukrainian/article_10444c16-aaf6-52c9-9878-1fce00ca8551.html,Anti-Russian
3458,Ukrainian 'special operation' rescued Melitopol mayor kidnapped by Russia,"Melitopol is a city in southern Ukraine with about 150,000 residents. Last Friday, Russian forces kidnapped the cityâ€™s mayor, Ivan Fedorov, in an apparent attempt to force him to collaborate. Video showed a man believed to be Fedorov being dragged out of a city building by Russian soldiers with a hood over his head.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the mayor of the Ukrainian city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has been kidnapped by a group of 10 armed men from Russian forces. More on this story: https://t.co/qRfl9buNB2 pic.twitter.com/TewvDoTEwN â€” Sky News (@SkyNews) March 12, 2022

The residents of Melitopol were not happy and protested in the face of Russian troops to demand Fedorov be released. They were chanting â€œWhereâ€™s our mayor?â€â€

From Melitopol:

â€œLocal residents, despite kidnappings and shooting at activists, continue to go to rallies. They demand the return of the kidnapped mayor Ivan Fedorov.â€#RussiaUkraineWar pic.twitter.com/S4gEkWZW6Z â€” Chris Alemany ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ðŸŒ¹ ðŸ‰ ðŸŒ² (@chrisalecanada) March 15, 2022

President Zelensky expressed his gratitude to the protesters.

Zelensky also claimed that Fedorov was still alive but was being tortured by the Russians.

Meanwhile, Russia installed a new mayor in the city and put her on TV to demand people not join the â€œextremistâ€ protests in the streets. She told them to â€œadjust to the new reality.â€

Danilchenko also announced that Russian TV would now be broadcast in Melitopol so that people would have â€œreliable information.â€

And Russia sent troops through the streets telling people protests were no longer allowed. Notice the response of the guy filming this.

But yesterday Ukrainian diplomat Olexander Scherba announced that Mayor Fedorov had been freed thanks to a â€œspecial operation.â€

Also yesterday, Scherba released video of President Zelensky speaking with Fedorov after his release. Both are speaking in Ukrainian but someone provided an unofficial transcript in English. â€œThank you so much for not leaving me,â€ Fedorov said. â€œWe donâ€™t leave our people,â€ Zelensky replied.

Fedorov said he would need a day or two to recover but Zelensky suggested he could only spare him for a day. â€œYouâ€™re a man, a hero, Iâ€™m very happy youâ€™re with us,â€ Zelensky said. Even without the translation, you get the sense of the conversation from Zelenskyâ€™s face and Fedorovâ€™s voice.

Unfortunately, this isnâ€™t the only case in which Russia has kidnaped Ukrainian elected officials.

Russian forces allegedly kidnapped another mayor in an occupied city in the region. Dniprorudne Mayor Yevgeny Matveyev was kidnapped on Sunday, according to Oleksandr Starukh, head of the regional military administration. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian officials claimed a third southern Ukrainian mayor â€” Oleksandr Yakovlyev of Skadovsk â€” and his deputy Yurii Palyukh were â€œabductedâ€ by Russian forces. â€œRussian invaders continue to abduct democratically elected local leaders in Ukraine,â€ Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraineâ€™s minister of foreign affairs, said on Twitter. â€œStates & international organizations must demand Russia to immediately release all abducted Ukrainian officials!â€

Finally, while weâ€™re on the topic of Russian kidnapping, letâ€™s not forget about WNBA star Brittney Griner who was arrested at an airport last month for allegedly having hash oil in her luggage. Today we learned that Grinerâ€™s detention had been extended.

Russian media reported that the detention of WNBA star Brittney Griner was extended until May 19, a development that could see the two-time Olympic champion being held for at least three months before her case is resolvedâ€¦ The court approved prosecutorsâ€™ request to extend her pre-trial detention in order to continue investigating her case. Tom Firestone, a former U.S. Justice Department legal resident advisor to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said that such delays are standard in Russia and that she may be held without trial for up to a year, or up to 18 months in extraordinary circumstances.

Whatâ€™s happening so far may be standard operating procedure in Russia, but thereâ€™s obvious concern that in the current climate Grinerâ€™s case could become politicized in a way that could make her situation worse.

â€œEveryoneâ€™s getting the strategy of say less and push more privately behind the scenes,â€ WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told the AP on Wednesday. â€œItâ€™s the strategy you get from the State Department and administration. Itâ€™s our No. 1 priority in talking with her agent and strategists.â€

So thereâ€™s a fine line to walk here but Hillary Clinton has already weighed in on this so not everyone is on board with saying less at this point.",https://hotair.com/john-s-2/2022/03/17/ukrainian-special-operation-rescued-melitopol-mayor-kidnapped-by-russia-n456148,Anti-Russian

Earlier in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of the DPR and LPR, saying the decision was long overdue.The official called Putin's decision the only one possible, in line with social consensus.""It [the decision] will put an end to the genocide of Donbass' people and open a new chapter in the history of the people's republics and in Russia's history. Ukraine can blame only its brainless rulers for the loss of Donbass and Crimea. I congratulate our Donetsk and Lugansk brothers!"", Aksyonov added.The situation in the breakaway Donbass region has escalated in recent days, with the DPR and LPR reporting increased shelling by Ukrainian forces and ordering general mobilisation in anticipation of an offensive by the Ukrainian Army. The evacuation of Donbass citizens, first of all, women, children, and the elderly, to Russia began late last week.In 2014, the Ukrainian authorities launched a military operation against the DPR and LPR after they declared independence and refused to recognise the new central government. Early clashes escalated into a protracted military conflict that claimed thousands of lives, including 3,095 civilians, and displaced over 2 million Ukrainians. A ceasefire was reached in 2020, but fighting occasionally breaks out.

7225,"Putin Declares War Moments Before Russia Begins Airstrikes, Ground Invasion","Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a speech delivered early Thursday morning, Moscow time, that Russia would undertake a â€œspecial military operationâ€ in Ukraine for the â€œdemilitarization and denazificationâ€ of the country.

Calling Ukraine part of Russiaâ€™s â€œhistorical territory,â€ Putin said that Russia aimed to change the countryâ€™s leadership.

As Putinâ€™s speech concluded, explosions were reported around Ukraine. They were soon followed by Ukrainian reports saying that land attacks were occurring across the countryâ€™s borders with Russia and Belarus, and with a reported incursion from Crimea.

The long-threatened war, waged by Russia against a peaceful Ukraine, had begun.

Early reports suggest that the full strength of the army that Russia has assembled is being brought to bear on Ukraine, with a wave of simultaneous explosions occurring across the country. Air raid sirens later sounded in Kyiv, and CNN broadcast images that appeared to show tanks cross the Belarusian border, near the capital.

Other reports are scattered, but suggest that both Russian and Belarusian troops were participating in the assault. CNN cited a Ukrainian military source as saying that the attacks had so far resulted in â€œhundredsâ€ of Ukrainian casualties. Itâ€™s unclear how many of those may be dead, and how many may be injured.

Observers on the ground also reported that masses of people were trying to flee Kyiv towards the west.

According to a statement from Ukraineâ€™s General Staff, rocket strikes hit airports and military bases across the country.

Most strikes appear to have hit in the center and east of Ukraine, but at least two strikes hit in the west of the country, near the cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk. Thatâ€™s hundreds of miles away from Kyiv, located only a few hours drive from NATO member states. CNN reported that air raid sirens sounded in Lviv, the largest city in the countryâ€™s far west near the Polish border.

Putin, in his video declaration, also had a threat for the U.S. and NATO over potential intervention in Ukraine.

â€œA couple of words for those who would be tempted to intervene,â€ he said. â€œRussia will respond immediately and you will have consequences that you never have had before in your history.â€

Ukrainian President Zelensky released a video online, saying that he had spoken with U.S. President Biden. â€œThe USA is preparing international support,â€ he said.

Now that Ukraine has been attacked, Zelensky told Ukraine, he was placing the country under martial law.

â€œWe are working, the army is working,â€ he said. â€œThe whole defense sector of Ukraine is working.â€

â€œNo panic, we are strong, we are prepared for it all, we will win,â€ Zelensky added.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said earlier in the night that â€œpeaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes,â€ calling it a â€œwar of aggression.â€

â€œUkraine will defend itself and will win,â€ he said. â€œThe world can and must stop Putin.â€

Anton Geraschenko, an MP who advises the countryâ€™s interior ministry, said that â€œrocket strikesâ€ had hit Ukraineâ€™s command-and-control centers, airports, and military stockpiles in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro, among other areas.

President Biden issued a statement soon after Putinâ€™s announcement, saying that Russia would be held accountable for launching the unprovoked assault.

â€œThe prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,â€ Biden said. â€œPresident Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.â€

In a surreal splitscreen, Putinâ€™s declaration of war ran in parallel with an emergency session of the UN Security Council.

Secretary General Antionio Guterres opened the session, saying that Wednesday had been full of â€œrumorsâ€ that a Russian offensive against Ukraine was about to occur.

â€œSo if indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance,â€ Guterres said. â€œToo many people have already died.â€

The attack comes after Putin delivered a blistering speech on Monday that set the stage for what was to come. In it, he denounced the concept of Ukrainian sovereignty as a product of Bolshevik dreamers and Vladimir Lenin in particular.

He ended that speech by demanding that Ukraineâ€™s government stop fighting.

â€œFrom those who seized power in Kyiv, we demand an immediate end to military action,â€ Putin said. â€œOtherwise, the regime ruling Ukraine will be fully responsible for potential continued bloodshed.â€

Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over implementing a 2015 peace deal soon collapsed, as Putin recognized the independence of two proxy republics that Russia created and supported since the early days of the war in 2014.

Many had regarded implementing the agreements, known as the Minsk-II accords, as the last possible off-ramp away from military action.

The agreements governed the peace that ended the last active phase of the conflict, which concluded as Russian forces surrounded a Ukrainian military unit in the countryâ€™s east.

Zelensky gave an address on Wednesday night, with a Russian-language portion directed at the Russian people, saying that he called Putin but that the Kremlin leader did not pick up.

â€œIf soldiers attack us, if they try to take our country, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves,â€ Zelensky said. â€œNot attack, but defend ourselves.â€

â€œAttacking us, you will see not our backs but our faces,â€ he added.

On Tuesday, the two proxy republics â€” located in the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk â€” asked the Kremlin to help them â€œrepelâ€ Ukrainian attacks. On the same day, Putin said that Russia had recognized the two statelets not in the territory that they occupied, but in their self-declared borders â€” an area that extends deep into Ukraine-controlled territory.

419,Bartiromo Links Hillary Clinton To Ukraine With Absurd Conspiracy Theory,"Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday declared that an investigation into Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign had discovered ""the biggest scandal ever."" But Bartiromo said that the news had been scuttled by a ""ruse"" to make it seem as if Russia is ready to invade Ukraine.

While appearing on Fox & Friends, Bartiromo reacted to a Fox News report that claimed Clinton's associates had tried to ""infiltrate"" Donald Trump's servers to prove that he had connections to Russia. The information was said to have come from Special Counsel John Durham's investigation into the origins of a so-called ""Russian dossier"" on Trump.

The report, however, did not accuse the Clinton campaign of conducting illegal activities during its investigation of Trump's ties to Russia.

Despite that, Bartiromo excitedly insisted that the findings were ""the biggest scandal ever.""

""Yes, it is now obviously the conclusion to what we have all known for several years,"" the Fox News host proclaimed. ""And for several years, I have been saying Hillary Clinton made the whole thing up and infiltrated Donald Trump and really damaged his reputation.""

According to Bartiromo, every American should be ""outraged"" by the news.

""We know that Hillary Clinton made the whole thing up but how is it possible that her people were able to infiltrate the president of the United States's server as well as his home as well as health care company?"" she ranted. ""It went right to the president of the United States!""

""I'll tell you, I hope Donald Trump sues them all for everything!"" Bartiromo exclaimed. ""Because they damaged his reputation throughout his four years in office.""

She added: ""Sure, she lost the election but this is so much bigger. This is the biggest scandal we have ever seen! Now we know for sure, they tried to cheat in the 2016 election! They tried to cheat in the 2020 election behind the guise of Covid!""

Despite dozens of legal challenges, no court has found widespread fraud in the 2020 election.

Bartiromo went on to suggest that Russia's possible invasion of Ukraine is a ""ruse"" to distract from the allegations against Clinton.

""The White House leakers have been running around saying Putin is going to invade Ukraine this Wednesday!"" she remarked. ""So is it really a ruse that they are going to invade this Wednesday or are they trying to create all of this drama because we were getting this Durham information?""",https://crooksandliars.com/2022/02/maria-bartiromo-links-hillary-clinton,Neutral
2782,Russia says it could seize assets Western companies leave behind,"By Mark Thompson, CNN Business

Russia said it could seize the assets of Western companies that have suspended operations in the country.

Dozens of American, European and Japanese companies from almost every sector of the economy have abandoned joint ventures, factories, stores and offices in the last two weeks in response to Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuring sanctions.

The sanctions have hit most of Russiaâ€™s financial sector, including its central bank, trashed the Russian currency and are likely to trigger a sovereign debt default and deep recession. And there may be more to come: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday that Russiaâ€™s economy will be â€œdevastatedâ€ as a consequence of existing Western sanctions, â€œbut we â€¦ continue to consider further steps we can take.â€

President Vladimir Putin had promised a response. Speaking Thursday at a meeting with government officials, he backed a plan to introduce â€œexternal managementâ€ of foreign companies leaving Russia.

â€œWe need to act decisively with those [companies] who are going to close their production,â€ Putin said according to a video posted by the Kremlin and aired on state media. â€œIt is necessary, then â€¦ to introduce external management and then transfer these enterprises to those who want to work,â€ he added.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said earlier that legislation had been drafted.

â€œIf foreign owners close the company unreasonably, then in such cases the government proposes to introduce external administration. Depending on the decision of the owner, it will determine the future fate of the enterprise,â€ Mishustin said, according to the Kremlin.

â€œThe key task will be to preserve â€¦ the activities of organizations and jobs. Most businesses are announcing a temporary suspension while maintaining jobs and wages, and we will be closely monitoring this situation,â€ he added.

The exodus of companies includes iconic consumer and tech brands such as McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Apple, as well as leading Big Oil groups such as BP and Shell. They were joined Thursday by Goldman Sachs, the first major bank since the war started to say it was winding down its activities in the country entirely. Other banks are likely to follow, leaving billions in outstanding debts behind them.

Russiaâ€™s consumer rights organization has drawn up a list of companies that have decided to leave and could be nationalized, according to a report in Russian newspaper Izvestiya later cited by state news agency TASS.

The document that was reportedly sent to the Russian government and the Prosecutor Generalâ€™s Office, includes 59 companies, including Volkswagen, Apple, IKEA, Microsoft, IBM, Shell, McDonaldâ€™s, Porsche, Toyota, H&M and can be updated with more brands, Izvestiya said.

The Russian government earlier Thursday issued a list of goods and equipment previously imported Russia that companies would be banned from transferring out of the country.

According to a statement published on the governmentâ€™s website, the list includes over 200 items, including â€œtechnological, telecommunications, medical equipment, vehicles, agricultural machinery, electrical equipmentâ€ as well as â€œrailway cars and locomotives, containers, turbines, metal and stone processing machines, monitors, projectors, consoles and panels.â€

Those restrictions will remain in effect until the end of 2022.

5504,Greenpeace activists tried to block a Russian oil tanker heading to Norway,"By Amy Cassidy and Anna Cooban, CNN Business

Norwegian police arrested seven Greenpeace activists on Monday after they chained themselves to a Russian oil tanker to try to prevent it docking at a port in Norway operated by Exxon.

The Ust Luga â€” loaded with Russian jet fuel worth $116 million â€” was on its way to Slagentangen port, about 53 miles south of the capital Oslo, when activists chained themselves to its anchor, Aud Hegli NordÃ¸, a spokesperson for Greenpeace Nordic, told CNN.

The Slagen oil terminal is owned by Esso, a subsidiary of US oil giant ExxonMobil.

In a bid to block the tanker from docking, seven Greenpeace activists set off in boats across the Oslo Fjord waters and chained themselves to the anchor, said NordÃ¸.

All were taken into police custody, in addition to several activists from climate action group Extinction Rebellion who joined the blockade, a spokesperson for Greenpeace confirmed to CNN. The ER activists were later released.

The Ust Luga is now docked in Slagen, according to tracking site Marine Traffic.

â€œThe fact that our government still allows the import of Russian fossil fuels in the current situation is unfathomable,â€ Frode Pleym, head of Greenpeace Norway, said in a statement to CNN.

â€œI am shocked that Norway operates as a free port for Russian oil, which we know finances [Russian President Vladimir] Putinâ€™s warfare.â€

The Ust Luga tanker is registered in Hong Kong, according to Marine Traffic.

The vessel is operated by Russian gas producer Novatek, according to shipping data provider Lloydâ€™s List Intelligence. Novatekâ€™s CEO and major shareholder is the oligarch Leonid Mikhelson, who CNN has previously reported as having close ties to Putin.

â€œThe transport of oil from Russia is not itself a violation of the sanctions that currently apply in the EU or in Norway,â€ Ane Haavardsdatter Lunde, a communications adviser for Norwayâ€™s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN in a statement. â€œThe Norwegian authorities therefore have no legal basis to stop a delivery such as this.â€

â€œIn areas outside the scope of the sanctions, it is the Governmentâ€™s view that each company must independently decide which actions it will take beyond those that comply with the existing legislation,â€ she added.

Greenpeace is also demanding Esso cancel its contracts with Russia.

A spokesperson for ExxonMobil told CNN in a statement that deliveries of Russian fuel to Norway â€œare fulfilling contracts that were in place prior to the invasion.â€

â€œWe have not made any new purchases of Russian products since the invasion, and there are no plans for future purchases,â€ she said.

â€œWe are fully complying with all sanctions, and we support the internationally coordinated efforts to bring Russiaâ€™s unprovoked attack to an end,â€ the spokesperson added.

A raft of energy companies exited Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in late February. BP, Shell and Norwegian state oil company Equinor have stopped trading Russian oil or entering into new contracts.

Exxon, which had been operating in Russia for more than 25 years, pledged to pull out of its Sakhalin-1 venture â€” a vast oil and natural gas project located off Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East.

BRUSSELS (AP) â€” European Union countries on Monday accused Russiaâ€™s military of committing war crimes in Ukraine, but appeared unlikely to target the countryâ€™s energy sector with sanctions soon despite a clamor across Europe for those responsible for attacks on civilians to be held to account.

With civilian deaths mounting in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol , German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock highlighted the increase in Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and theaters.

The â€œcourts will have to decide, but for me these are clearly war crimes,â€ Baerbock said.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who chaired a meeting of the blocâ€™s foreign ministers in Brussels, said that â€œwhatâ€™s happening in Mariupol is a massive war crime. Destroying everything, bombarding and killing everybody in an indiscriminate manner. This is something awful.â€

The encircled southern city on the Sea of Azov has seen some of the worst horrors of the war. City officials say that at least 2,300 people have died in the siege, with some buried in mass graves.

The International Criminal Court in the Netherlands is gathering evidence about any possible war crimes in Ukraine, but Russia, like the United States, doesnâ€™t recognize the tribunalâ€™s jurisdiction.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said his country is â€œcertainly open to other mechanisms for accountability in terms of the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine right now.â€

Coveney said Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine â€œis driving a fury across the European Union within the public as to why canâ€™t we stop this.â€ He said Europeans â€œwant people held to account for the decisions taken and the brutality that we have seen.â€

Coveney expects that a new round of EU sanctions will be drawn up soon, possibly by the time U.S. President Joe Biden arrives in Brussels on Thursday for talks with European leaders at NATO and EU headquarters.

Notorious for their often slow responses, EU nations have rallied since the invasion began on Feb. 24 to slap sanctions on hundreds of people, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, senior ministers and pro-Kremlin oligarchs.

Several â€œentitiesâ€ â€“ companies, banks, airlines and ship builders â€“ have also been hit in near record time. But the issue of imposing restrictive measures on Russian energy remains extremely sensitive, given the dependence of many EU countries on Russian oil and natural gas.

Coveney said energy sanctions are unlikely to be on the table this week.

A group of countries led by Germany wants a pause on new sanctions for now, amid concerns about high energy prices and fears that Russia might halt gas exports to Europe. Some also want to save sanction ammunition for any new and major war atrocity, like the use of chemical weapons.

But Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, whose country borders Russia and Belarus, warned against â€œsanctions fatigue.â€

â€œWe cannot get tired imposing sanctions. We cannot get tired, offering assistance and help to Ukraine,â€ he said. Landsbergis said the EU must target oil, a major source of revenue for Russia .

He said the EU must also start thinking about what kind of attack by Russia would constitute a â€œred lineâ€ for tougher measures. The shelling of cities and civilians, he said, doesnâ€™t appear to be enough to persuade some member countries â€œbut somewhere there, there has to be one.â€

Landsbergis also said the Baltic nations of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia need their defenses bolstered by partner countries.

â€œWe need to see more equipment, and first of all the actual defense plans (for) the Baltic countries that would reflect the changed strategic reality of the region,â€ he told reporters.

The ministers did endorse a second tranche of 500 million euros ($552 million) to help buy weapons and other aid for Ukraine, Borrell said.

7765,An 85-year-old law paves the way for Canadians to fight in Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky recently announced that Ukraineâ€™s armed forces will welcome foreign volunteers and build an international brigade following Russiaâ€™s invasion of his country.

Soon after his announcement, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss expressed her support for Britons seeking to fight for Ukraine. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister of Foreign Affairs MÃ©lanie Joly made similar remarks:

â€œWe understand that people of Ukrainian descent want to support their fellow Ukrainians and also that there is a desire to defend the motherland and in that sense it is their own individual decision â€¦. Let me be clear: we are all very supportive of any form of support to Ukrainians right now.â€

Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand similarly told â€œall foreigners willing to defend Ukraine and world orderâ€ to contact the foreign diplomatic missions of Ukraine.

Calls for help

Ukraineâ€™s call for foreign volunteers is nothing new. Embattled nations have long called upon adventurers, diasporas, religious adherents and ideological sympathizers to join in their struggles. Canadians have an equally long history of answering such calls, including during the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s and the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s.

These volunteers can play a variety of roles. In some cases, they might be specialists like pilots or medical doctors who are in short supply and are urgently needed. In other conflicts, foreign volunteers can appreciably add to the mass of a countryâ€™s military force.

Regardless of the quantity or type of volunteers, the call for help is perhaps most important in signalling a simple message: we are not alone. Zelensky is unambiguously telling the world that Ukraineâ€™s fight is everyoneâ€™s fight; Ukraineâ€™s cause is everyoneâ€™s cause. And once foreign volunteers are in place, this message becomes clearer and stronger.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Greenslade

The plight of the Ukrainian people is there for all to see on social media right now â€” imagine the impact of videos from the front lines narrated by a Torontonian, a Winnipegger or an Edmontonian?

This type of involvement in war zones is what the Canadian government has sought to avoid in the past. Getting Canadians home amid or after a conflict, whether theyâ€™re released from service or held in prisoner-of-war camps, costs money and political capital.

Claims of neutrality are questioned

Volunteers fighting in foreign wars can lead foreign governments and voters to question a countryâ€™s claims of neutrality if it has opted not to get directly involved in the conflict.

Killed or wounded Canadians can also ignite heated debates about what constitutes a veteran since theyâ€™re not members of the Canadian Armed Forces, and who will provide for the returned volunteers or their families.

These issues can be particularly challenging when they illuminate sectarian or ideological divides.

Just before Confederation in 1867, as many as 50,000 Canadians went to fight for American federal forces during the U.S. Civil War, even as other British North Americans supported the Confederacy, most notably in the Maritimes. Recruiters were prosecuted in police courts, but not the volunteers themselves.

In the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), nearly 1,700 Canadian volunteers fought to defend Spainâ€™s elected government.

Others, notably conservatives in QuÃ©bec like Premier Maurice Duplessis, decried the volunteer movementâ€™s connection to the Communist Party of Canada and lauded the leader of the nationalist rebellion, Gen. Francisco Franco, as the hero of Catholicism.

The Foreign Enlistment Act

These tensions caused a unity crisis and compelled Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and Justice Minister Ernest Lapointe to pass the countryâ€™s Foreign Enlistment Act in 1937. They applied the act to the situation in Spain by an order-in-council.

The act remains in effect today. It prohibits Canadians from joining the armed forces of any nation â€œat war with any friendly state.â€ So in a conflict in which Canada is genuinely neutral, that means Canadians canâ€™t join the armed forces of any belligerent party.

In the present war, the statute would prohibit a Canadian from joining the Russian military â€” but not Ukraineâ€™s.

In 1937, the act allowed King and Lapointe to argue they were doing something about Canadian volunteers in Spain. Recruiters, largely organized by the Communist Party of Canada, kept most of their efforts underground and quiet to avoid prosecution.

The Canadian volunteers were not seriously investigated. Although charges were nearly pressed against the recruiters, the endeavour was abandoned when the RCMP and the Department of Justice feared public backlash.

The actâ€™s prohibition on recruiting is broad. Itâ€™s an offence to recruit within Canada for the armed forces of any state, friendly or hostile.

However, consular and diplomatic officers of that foreign state are allowed to engage in such activities. This is presumably why Canadian officials have pointed potential volunteers to Ukrainian embassies and consulates. Any prospective grassroots recruiters would be wise to take the same approach.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck

Canada is largely behind Ukraine

The tensions exacerbated by Canadian volunteers in previous wars, and the corresponding desire for strategic ambiguity by the federal government, arenâ€™t present in the current crisis. Canadians seem to be universally in Ukraineâ€™s corner.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young

The statements by Joly and Anand have helped eliminate ambiguity at a moment when time is of the essence. This is not to say that the other costs of foreign volunteerism will vanish. If Canadian volunteers go to Ukraine, some will undoubtedly be killed or captured. But as Joly has indicated, this is a risk the volunteers must accept of their own volition.

After Ukraine and Russia, Canada is home to more people of Ukrainian descent than any other country on Earth. The 2016 census shows 1.4 million Canadians of Ukrainian ancestry, a third of which are aged 25 to 54 â€” in other words, of fighting age.

We can only guess how many of them might contemplate the idea, but if even a fraction elect to make the journey, there could soon be large numbers of Canadians in Ukraine.",https://theconversation.com/an-85-year-old-law-paves-the-way-for-canadians-to-fight-in-ukraine-178090,Neutral
1939,"Sorting fact, disinformation amid Russian war on Ukraine","Associated Press journalists around Ukraine and beyond are documenting military activity during Russiaâ€™s invasion. With disinformation rife and social media amplifying military claims and counterclaims, determining exactly what is happening can be difficult. Hereâ€™s a look at what could be confirmed Thursday as Russiaâ€™s war on Ukraine was in its eighth day.

DIRECTLY WITNESSED

â€” Zainish Hussain, a Pakistani citizen who moved to Kherson after marrying a Ukrainian woman, told the AP by video from his home about the Russian takeover of the city, which he said was the â€œscariest day of his life.â€ He said Russian tanks rolled down his block and soldiers fired into the air to get civilians to clear the street, which he showed was now empty.

â€” AP reporters surveyed destruction in the village of Gorenka, which lies on the outskirts of Ukraineâ€™s capital, Kyiv, and has found itself in the crossfire. Residents said a Russian plane bombed the village early Wednesday, destroying several homes.

â€” AP reporters in Kyiv heard at least one overnight explosion before videos started circulating online of apparent strikes on the city, though targets were not immediately clear. Kyivâ€™s mayor said the explosions were missiles being shot down by Ukraineâ€™s air defense systems.

â€” People, mostly women, children and the elderly, were seen fleeing Ukraine for neighboring European nations by foot and packed into trains. Some of those leaving amid the cold gripping Eastern Europe also have serious mental and physical disabilities.

ANNOUNCED BY UKRAINIAN AUTHORITIES

â€” A spokesman for Europeâ€™s largest nuclear plant said Russians began shelling the power station. The plant is in Enerhodar, a city on the Dnieper River that accounts for one-quarter of the countryâ€™s power generation. The spokesman said the shelling began early Friday.

â€” The mayor of Enerhodar said Ukrainian and Russian forces were battling for control of the city. Verified video showed people there streaming away from a billowing inferno.

â€” Shelling was reported in the northern city of Chernihiv, where Ukrainian emergency officials said at least 33 civilians were killed and 18 were wounded in a Russian bombardment of a residential area. They said the search of the rubble for additional casualties was suspended because shelling resumed.

â€” Zelenskyy claimed in his address that 9,000 Russians have been killed since the invasion. It was impossible to verify the claim. Russia said Wednesday that nearly 500 of its troops had been killed since the Feb. 24 start of the invasion.

â€” The general staff of Ukraineâ€™s armed forces said Russian forces â€œdid not achieve the main goal of capturing Mariupol,â€ a crucial city on the Azov Sea. The regional governor said Thursday that the cityâ€™s access to electricity, water, heating and food had been cut, and he described the siege as punishing.

ANNOUNCED BY RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES

â€” Speaking at a meeting with members of his Security Council, Putin accused Ukrainian nationalist groups of preventing civilians from leaving and using them as human shields. The claim couldnâ€™t be independently verified.

â€” The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said Russia claims that its military has taken control of the area around Ukraineâ€™s largest nuclear power plant. Russia had already seized control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which was the site of the worldâ€™s worst nuclear disaster.

ANNOUNCED BY OFFICIALS IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE

â€” The U.N. human rights office said at least 227 civilians have been killed and 525 wounded in Ukraine since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24, though it acknowledged that is a vast undercount.

â€” German news agency dpa reported that the countryâ€™s economy ministry approved sending 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine. The weapons are Soviet-made, shoulder-fired Strela surface-to-air missiles left over from East German army supplies. Berlin had already authorized sending 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine.

7592,Senior defense official: No sign yet of Belarusian forces fighting in Ukraine,"U.S. officials have not seen Belarusian troops involved in or preparing to join the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said Monday.

â€œWe have seen no indications that Belarusian troops are being readied to move into Ukraine and certainly no indications that they are in fact moving or are in Ukraine,â€ the official told reporters. â€œOur best information is that the forces inside Ukraine are all Russians.â€

Reports emerged earlier Monday that Belarus is preparing to send troops into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion which began last week.

Russian President Vladimir Putin so far has sent into Ukraine â€œjust under 75 percentâ€ of the more than 150,000 troops he had assembled for the assault, and forces have fired more than 380 missiles, the official said.

The Kremlin has already used Belarus as a location from which to pour its troops quickly across the border into Ukraine after insisting the large number of forces assembled there were for joint military drills.

The U.S. has also â€œseen some indicationsâ€ that Russia in some areas of Ukraine is employing mercenaries from the shadowy Russian military contractor the Wagner Group, though details on where or how many are not clear.

The official also said Russian forces are frustrated they have not yet taken the capital city of Kyiv, which could lead them to take a â€œmore aggressive approachâ€ militarily.

â€œThey have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv,â€ they said. â€œOne of the things that that could result in is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt, in both the size and scale of their targeting of Kyiv.â€

The Russians are â€œrunning out of gas and theyâ€™re having logistics problemsâ€ on the way south to Kyiv and have also met significant Ukrainian resistance.

Still, the Kremlin forces are roughly 16 miles away from the capital city, which they hope to encircle, according to the official.

â€œWe do believe that their plans are to encircle the city and they try to take it that way because that has really been where the heaviest fighting has been,â€ they said.",https://thehill.com/policy/defense/596130-senior-defense-official-no-sign-of-belarusian-forces-fighting-in-ukraine,Neutral

8366,Jewish group chats facilitate escape,"By Zach Golden March 10, 2022

In the early days of the Russian invasion, Kharkiv native Oleg Kosariev, who now lives in Israel, lost touch with his mother and stepfather, who had no electricity and had taken shelter in a basement of their home in the Ukrainian city.

He would have to wait until he could communicate with them again, but once he did, he wanted to give them a way out.

Jewish group chats would show him the way.

The Jewish community in Ukraine is well connected, glued together by faith, tradition and longstanding nationwide and local group chats. Those chat networks sprang to life as the Russian invasion began, coordinating evacuations, medicine and food deliveries.

Through one of these chats, Kosariev learned of a young Jewish community leader in Kharkiv, Violetta Koshina, who was organizing a fleet of buses leaving the city, which his parents could follow by car.

â€œThereâ€™s people from Jewish community that you can trust and they can bring you out,â€ he told his parents once he was able to speak with them again. â€œI know some of the people in the buses.â€

Hanna Kosarieva, 49, and Valeriy Makeev, 48, followed the buses out of Kharkiv, and are now in relative safety, near the Western city of Lviv. Their journey took nearly four days.

â€œIf not for the Jewish communication, I would not know about the convoy,â€ Kosariev, 27, said in an interview.

Related opinion My Jewish family is being bombed in Ukraine

Jewish groups certainly arenâ€™t the only ones in Ukraine using group chats, social media and other modern means of communication to shepherd refugees to safety. But their Jewishness is drawing Jews who have never met each other together.

Two days into his mother and stepfatherâ€™s escape, Kosariev, who made aliyah in 2018, relied on a different group chat, from a Birthright Israel trip he took several years ago. A member gave his mother and stepfather â€” and any others trying to flee â€” a place to rest in the mid-sized city of Vinnytsia before they continued westward.

Throughout the escape, Kosariev navigated for his mother and stepfather, who he said were too shocked to think clearly for themselves. He wants them to join him in Israel, but said his mother canâ€™t, because documentation of her familyâ€™s Jewishness was lost the last time Kharkiv was invaded, in World War II.

Kosariev is frustrated with Israel, for failing to make it easier for Ukrainians to immigrate, and for that reason â€” and also some homesickness for Jewish life in Ukraine â€” said he intends to move back after the war.

He believes other Israelis, feeling similarly, will also return when the conflict is over.

â€œWhen the day will come,â€ he said. â€œ A lot of people will go back to Ukraine.â€

309,China is making sanctions on Russia irrelevant,"The invasion of Ukraine can now begin.

China, from all appearances, has given Vladimir Putin the one thing he needs to defy the United States and the international community. The Russian autocrat looks like he has secured an economic lifeline from Beijing.

â€œWhat everybody forgets here is Russia needs to be able to sell that gas and sell that oil,â€ President Joe Biden said Monday during his press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. â€œRussia relies â€” a significant part of Russiaâ€™s budget â€” itâ€™s the only thing they really have to export. And if, in fact, itâ€™s cut off, then theyâ€™re going to be hurt very badly.

Biden was talking about Nord Stream 2, the pipeline slated to carry Russian gas to Europe through Germany. If Russia invades Ukraine, Washington does not want the pipeline to start operation.

The Russian strongman was one step ahead of the American president, however. Putin, in Beijing on Feb. 4 for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, announced $117.5 billion of new oil and gas deals with China. â€œOur oilmen have prepared very good new solutions on hydrocarbon supplies to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China,â€ he declared.

The new deals will not help Russia with the current crisis â€” gas will not start flowing over a new pipeline to China for at least two years â€” but Beijing can increase purchases of Russian hydrocarbons under existing arrangements.

Nonetheless, Beijingâ€™s message to the United States and others was unmistakable. â€œThe Russian and Chinese governments have made clear to the world that their joint confrontation with the United States will include a strategy of taking care of each otherâ€™s needs,â€ Jonathan Ward, the author of â€œChinaâ€™s Vision of Victory,â€ told me after Putinâ€™s announcement of the oil and gas deals. â€œChina, through its economic courtship of Iran, has already demonstrated its willingness to work with nations that have been sanctioned by the West.â€

Beijingâ€™s support suggests it is thinking of taking advantage of the conflict in Eastern Europe to engage in mischief of its own. As Ward says, â€œthe Russia-China relationship has been blossoming on a wide range of fronts â€” military, energy, infrastructure, even authoritarian ideology â€” and we should expect that Beijing will want to throw a lifeline to its partners in the Kremlin, in part because distracting America in Eastern Europe may keep us off balance in Asia.â€

The announcement of the new Russia-China oil and gas arrangements makes Washingtonâ€™s warnings seem hollow, or at least behind-the-times. â€œWe have â€” and when I say we I mean collectively, the United States and our allies and partners â€” we have an array of tools that we can deploy if we see foreign companies, including those in China, doing their best to backfill U.S. export control actions, to evade them, to get around them,â€ said State Department spokesperson Ned Price last week during his regular press briefing.

Chinaâ€™s commitment to buy more Russian oil and gas certainly qualifies as â€œbackfilling,â€ especially because Biden has identified hydrocarbon sales as the core of Putinâ€™s economy, which means they are essential to Putinâ€™s war machine. The concern is not theoretical: Reuters reports that Russia might use a field already under U.S. sanctions to supply gas to China pursuant to the just-announced deals.

After Putinâ€™s more than two-and-a-half-hour meeting on Friday with Xi Jinping, Moscow and Beijing issued a joint statement announcing â€œthat the new inter-State relations between China and Russia are superior to political and military alliances of the Cold War era.â€ â€œFriendship between the two States,â€ the statement declared, â€œhas no limits, there are no â€˜forbiddenâ€™ areas of cooperation.â€

Price, the State Department spox, has an answer. â€œNo partnership,â€ he said last week, â€œcan account for the massive economic toll that weâ€™ve talked about given the financial tools that are available to us, the sanctions tools that are available to us, and the export control actions, among others, that weâ€™re in a position to take.â€

Yes, the United States can cripple Russia, but only if the U.S. prevents Chinese backfilling. U.S. policymakers, with the exception of those in the Trump years, have fervently believed that engaging the Chinese state would encourage it to become a â€œresponsible stakeholderâ€ in the international system.

American policy, therefore, has generally been extraordinarily indulgent, ignoring blatant Chinese sanctions-busting in the belief that Beijing would eventually come to see things Washingtonâ€™s way. The result is that China has suffered almost no cost in openly â€” and continually â€” violating U.S. and U.N. sanctions on, for instance, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea.

Chinese policymakers know that Americans can impose what Ward calls â€œstate-killer sanctionsâ€ on them, but they appear to believe the Biden administration would not dare.

Therefore, China appears ready to backfill and shows no fear in fueling Russian aggression. America, consequently, must now get ready for conflicts on both ends of the Eurasian landmass, facing two large and bold states that believe themselves to be a team â€” and beyond the reach of the United States.

Volodymyr Zelensky addresses Stanford students at CEMEX Auditorium on Friday. (Eric He/Patch)

PALO ALTO, CA â€” Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, looked out at a packed room full of Stanford students on Friday morning at the CEMEX Auditorium and broached a question that can be found on many college applications: â€œWhat matters most to you, and why?â€

â€œThis the most important question to me,â€ said Zelensky, who addressed the Stanford community in a speech followed by a question and answer session at an event hosted by the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. It was Zelenskyâ€™s first public address in the United States since he spoke to Congress in March. For Zelensky â€” whose country has been attempting to fend off an invasion by Russia for three months and counting â€” the question was part of an appeal for the United States and the rest of the international world to keep paying attention to Ukraine, and to consider the Russian-instigated war as an existential threat to the ideals of democracy.

â€œTo be helped, you have to be listened to and heard,â€ Zelensky said. â€œThis is the most important thing for the people to know. The truth of this war.â€ Zelensky actually visited and spoke at Stanford last September, months before his country was turned upside down by the unprovoked attack by Russia. In that speech, he was dressed in a suit. On Friday, he was behind a screen, wearing his now-trademark dark green t-shirt with a glass of water by his side and a pen to jot down the live translation to studentsâ€™ questions.

For the president of a country mired in a devastating war, Zelensky was remarkably upbeat, addressing students by name, cracking jokes when he couldnâ€™t understand the translation and showing the charisma he developed as an actor in his former career and that earned him international respect as he has maintained a grip on his country amid the chaos. â€œYour voice should be loud, should be vocal,â€ Zelensky told students. â€œThis is what weâ€™re expecting of you. Youâ€™re not only a new generation, youâ€™re the generation of ambassadors.â€

The event was hosted by Michael McFaul, the director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and the former United States ambassador to Russia. In an interview with Patch following the event, McFaul â€” who knows Zelensky personally â€” said it was not a surprise that Zelensky chose Stanford out of all the universities in America. McFaul has spoken to him a few times since the war began and Zelensky has Stanford alums working in his office.

Zelensky appreciated the relationship with Stanford, and heâ€™s always wanted to speak to students, according to McFaul. â€œYou could tell that he likes interacting with students and he feels very comfortable in an audience like this,â€ McFaul said. â€œI was very proud of our students. I thought they asked some great questions and I thought the way he answered them said a lot about his character.â€ The final question to Zelensky asked him to reflect on what he would tell his 20-year-old self in college, and he responded by comparing the privileges of what American students have with the harsh reality of what college-aged Ukrainians are faced with. â€œSomeone is studying in universities and someone is standing in line for the drafting station and answering the calls for mobilization,â€ Zelensky said. â€œUnfortunately, not all of them will see a chance to write a thesis. Not all of them will stay alive.

Weâ€™ve seen months of frantic U.S.-led diplomacy, European visits to the Kremlin, speeches in Munich, additional U.S. troops dispatched to reinforce NATO, UN Security Council meetings and new sanctions on top of old sanctions.

Nonetheless, itâ€™s hard to escape the sense that the mighty democracies of the West are not so much standing with Ukraine as sitting like spectators at the Colosseum â€” watching Ukraine do single combat against Russia.

To be sure, the U.S. and its allies are rooting for Ukraine, providing Ukraine with military hardware and logistical support, and rolling out stacks of sanctions and condemnations and other non-kinetic punishments for Russia.

But this is now a gunfight â€” a war â€” not a diplomatic dinner party or a Harvard seminar. Yes, formal alliances matter, and Ukraine is not part of the 30-member NATO alliance. But right now Ukraine is the frontline in a showdown over the unwritten rules of the prevailing world order â€” and you can bet Chinaâ€™s dictator, Xi Jinping, with his own predatory ambitions, is watching, and learning plenty about how we handle such things these days.

When Biden says, repeatedly, that he will not send troops to fight Russia, because â€œThatâ€™s a world war when Americans and Russians start shooting at one another,â€ thatâ€™s a clear message to Putin that if heâ€™s willing to send guns into non-NATO terrain, itâ€™s open season. America might send aid, but Americaâ€™s mighty armed forces will steer clear.

In that calculus, it is no longer America deterring Russia, but Russia deterring us.

Putting America on the defensive is clearly part of that Putin playbook from which the White House has been sharing selected excerpts with the world. Among the items the White House has not been publicizing is the leverage Putin enjoys when the White House is filled with people so terrified of triggering his next aggressive move that they carry on trying to cajole and appease him until after heâ€™s made it. At that stage â€” witness the explosions now taking place in Kyiv â€” Russiaâ€™s predations become far more damaging, costly, and hard to reverse.

Putin took advantage of much the same White House hesitancy during the Obama-Biden administration, when Putin in 2014 seized Crimea from Ukraine and effectively dared the free world to do anything about it. Obama scolded and rolled out sanctions, Russia absorbed them and kept Crimea. Following Bidenâ€™s August 2021 debacle in Afghanistan, and the shackling of U.S. energy while waving ahead Russian gas for Germany last year, Putin evidently concluded the stars had aligned to invade the rest of Ukraine.

Itâ€™s far more compelling right now to muster respect for the late-night comedian turned courageous president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, risking his life in his countryâ€™s defense, than to trust the career politician turned president of America, now week-ending in Delaware, having urged us all to wait a month to see what sanctions can do.

Weâ€™re hearing a lot from Biden and his team about how Russiaâ€™s war on Ukraine is animating and unifying NATO. Biden is doing the right thing in dispatching more troops to shore up NATOâ€™s members in Eastern Europe. But thatâ€™s not a big help to Ukrainians now fighting for their country in a hot war. When the U.S. offered to evacuate Zelenskyy, his response said it all: â€œThe fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.â€

Nor is it clear that NATOâ€™s vaunted unity is all that unified. Germany, a pivotal NATO member which for years has chosen a lifestyle entailing a small military and big reliance on Russian gas, does not inspire confidence (despite the suspension, for now, of opening up Nord Stream 2 to bring more gas from Russia â€” Iâ€™ll believe the Germans mean it when they rip out the actual pipeline).

One of the most despicable scenes as Putin massed his forces to threaten Ukraine, was Germany refusing last month to greenlight the export of German-origin weapons to Ukraine from the Baltics â€” themselves high on Putinâ€™s hit list, despite their NATO memberships. Germany has now reversed its policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz noticing, at this late hour, that Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine â€œthreatens our entire post-war order.â€ Germany is now allowing transit, and plans to send anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine â€” or, and this is now the problem â€” whatever is left of it.

Biden says that if NATO is attacked, America will fight for every inch, as Article 5 of the NATO charter requires. An attack on one will be treated as an attack on all. Thatâ€™s great, and America must stand by it.

But if we are then to avoid the moment in Putinâ€™s escalating game of chicken when he tests Bidenâ€™s precarious credibility by turning his guns on NATO members such as the Baltics and Poland, something more is needed. We can debate â€” the quicker the better â€” what that should be, but it has got to entail better strategy, tougher resolve, and more willingness to take the risks needed to deter not only Russia, but China â€” with its sights now on Taiwan, and beyond.

Surely it is not actually good for NATO, or for the rest of the free world, if America defaults to a strategy of sharing box seats with its formal allies at the Colosseum, while friendly polities not privileged with any formal alliance are forced one by one into the arena, to do single combat with Russia â€” or, for that matter, China.",https://pjmedia.com/claudiarosett/2022/02/26/ukraine-in-the-colosseum-n1562140,Neutral
9307,Biden expresses 'disappointment' that 'they will not let me' visit Ukraine,"President Biden on Friday expressed disappointment he was unable to include a visit into Ukraine as part of his European trip amid Russia's invasion.

Biden addressed U.S. troops stationed in Poland on Friday, and during a roundtable conversation about the humanitarian crisis the war in Ukraine has caused, he suggested he wanted to visit Ukraine but was unable to do so due to security concerns, CNN reports.

""Quite frankly, part of my disappointment is that I can't see it firsthand like I have in other places,"" Biden said. ""They will not let me, understandably, I guess, cross the border and take a look at what's going on in Ukraine.""

There had been questions ahead of Biden's trip to Europe as to whether he might visit Ukraine. But White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that while Biden's trip ""will be focused on continuing to rally the world in support of the Ukrainian people and against President Putin's invasion of Ukraine,"" there were ""no plans to travel into Ukraine.""

While speaking to U.S. troops, Biden said the world is at an ""inflection point,"" and the stakes of the conflict include whether democracy or autocracy is ""going to prevail."" He also appeared the suggest the troops might be going into Ukraine, telling them about what they are ""going to see when you're there."" A White House spokesperson later clarified to The Independent's Andrew Feinberg, ""The president has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.""

7612,Dori: Local woman born in Ukraine calls Russian attacks on children â€˜a new kind of sickâ€™,"News from her Ukrainian aunts, uncles, and cousins caught in Russiaâ€™s invasion of her homeland alternately grip Covington resident Kristina Soltys in â€œa whirlwindâ€ of fear and ethnic pride.

But it was her anger that spilled over on The Dori Monson Show when she described her familyâ€™s stories about Russian attacks targeting locations with Ukrainian children.

Learning of the initial invasion â€œshook me more than I expected â€“ far more than I expected,â€ Soltys told Dori and his listeners Monday.

Born and raised in Ukraine before moving to the United States when she was 5 years old, Soltys still has close ties with her extended family in eastern Europe. She described some family members hunkering down in windowless bathrooms for protection â€“ and others fighting from the ground.

Not long after the initial assaults, Russian attacks soon â€œgot dirtyâ€ and â€œinhumane,â€ Soltys said, her voice catching as she fought through emotions.

â€œWhen you want to take a country, invade. Take their industrial zones, take what you need â€” the big things. I can almost understand that,â€ Soltys continued. â€œBut when you start attacking pediatric oncology units, child care, hospitals, big high-rise residential zones â€“ that is sick. That is a new kind of sick. You donâ€™t do that. You donâ€™t touch the children in any war.â€

While many in the West have called Ukrainians â€œstrongâ€ and â€œbrave,â€ Soltys wants Americans to understand their depth of â€œkindness.â€

â€œI am getting my information straight from there,â€ she said. â€œRegularly, I am hearing about Ukrainian citizens who are feeding Russian soldiers â€“ not killing them. Many Russian soldiers say, â€˜We didnâ€™t understand where we were coming.â€™ So many of them didnâ€™t understand the mission. (Russian leaders) took their cell phones away.â€

Meanwhile, Soltys told Doriâ€™s listeners that she is getting reports about â€œmissiles going into spaceâ€ without hurting civilians or destroying buildings.

This, her family tells her, is when they â€œfeel the support from everyoneâ€™s prayers,â€ Soltys said.

â€œCall it a miracle,â€ she said, â€œbut please keep praying.â€

492,Russia withdrawing SOME of its forces from Ukraine border and slams reports of imminent invasion,"Russia is said to be withdrawing some of its forces from Ukraineâ€™s border after it slammed the imminent invasion talk as well as how some countries are moving their embassies, like the US.

NY POST â€“ Russia said Tuesday it is moving some of its forces away from Ukraineâ€™s border and slammed reports of an imminent invasion as â€œostentatious hysteriaâ€ â€” but the West reacted skeptically to the announcement, questioning the Kremlinâ€™s credibility and pointing to the presence of a massive military force still arrayed near the former Soviet state.

â€œWeâ€™ve always said the troops will return to their bases after the exercises are over. This is the case this time as well,â€ Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to Reuters.

However, it was unclear exactly how many units were being withdrawn after a build-up of an estimated 130,000 Russian forces to the north, east and south of Ukraine.

Peskov also accused the US of fueling the crisis by warning repeatedly of an invasion â€” to the point where Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had joked about it.

â€œHe asks (us) to find out if the exact time, to the hour, of the start of the war has been published. Itâ€™s impossible to be understanding of this manic information madness,â€ the spokesperson said.

Peskov took particular issue with moves by several Western countries, including the US and Canada, to relocate their embassies away from the Ukrainian capital Kiev.

â€œThis is some sort of ostentatious hysteria, which of course is not based on anything,â€ he said, per Agence France-Presse.

The troop pullback from the Ukrainian border would be the first major step toward de-escalation in the weeks-long standoff between Russia and the West.

Footage released Tuesday by the Russian Defense Ministry showed some tanks and other armored vehicles being loaded onto railway cars.

Still, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kiev would only â€œbelieve in de-escalationâ€ after it sees Russiaâ€™s pullout, the Interfax Ukraine news agency reported.

â€œWe wonâ€™t believe when we hear, weâ€™ll believe when we see. When we see troops pulling out, weâ€™ll believe in de-escalation,â€ Kuleba said.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg added: â€œSo far, we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground, not seen any signs of reduced Russian military presence on the borders of Ukraine.â€

But he noted that there are â€œsome grounds for cautious optimismâ€ for diplomatic efforts emerging from Moscow in recent days.",https://therightscoop.com/russia-withdrawing-some-of-its-forces-from-ukraine-border-and-slams-reports-of-imminent-invasion/,Neutral

1001,"Putin is on a personal mission to rewrite Cold War history, making the risks in Ukraine far graver","There is no shortage of speculation about what Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to do with the vast Russian military force now virtually encircling Ukraine, and why he has amassed it.

Its sheer size â€“ the largest combat force assembled in Europe since the second world war â€“ suggests a maximalist approach: erasing the humiliation of the Soviet Unionâ€™s breakup 30 years ago with a massive, bloody and swift invasion of Ukraine on multiple fronts.

Indeed, a full-scale attack looks increasingly imminent with an estimated 80% of Russian forces now in combat-ready position and separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine formally requesting help combating what they falsely claim is aggression from the Ukrainian military.

Others see it differently, believing Putin will be content with his gains so far. Some also consider Russiaâ€™s recognition of the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as signalling a muscular warning to Western leaders who have repeatedly ignored Russian security concerns.

Another view suggests Putin will opt for a hybrid strategy similar to Russiaâ€™s playbook in its 2008 war with Georgia: threatening to use force, formally recognising breakaway provinces, and destroying its adversaryâ€™s military â€“ but stopping short of actual conquest.

Putinâ€™s anger laid bare

Who is right? Each scenario is feasible, but the question of how to interpret Russian motives became clearer after Putinâ€™s bizarre February 22 meeting with his Security Council in Moscow.

At the meeting, he humiliated Russian spy chief Sergei Naryshkin for forgetting the script and supporting the incorporation of Donetsk and Luhansk directly into Russia, instead of just recognising their independence.

The meeting was a pre-recorded charade. Even the time shown on Putinâ€™s own watch suggested the signing ceremony to recognise the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk had occurred before the meeting with his chiefs had even started.

But it was Putinâ€™s angry speech afterwards that made clear just how personal this conflict might be.

He opined at length that Ukraine was a â€œcolony with a puppet regimeâ€ and had no right to exist. It recalled Putinâ€™s 2021 essay bemoaning the collapse of the USSR and claiming Russia and Ukraine were one people, hence denying Ukrainians sovereignty and identity.

His speech this week also included the false claim that Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin created Ukraine, praise for strongman Joseph Stalin, and the fanciful charge that Ukraine would seek to develop nuclear weapons.

In doing so, Putin resembled more a Russian ultranationalist with a shaky grasp of history than a pragmatic master strategist.

A personal mission to rewrite history

The charade could be dismissed as domestic posturing â€“ a president in absolute command appealing to the patriotic urges of a population wary of conflict. But Putin seems to regard it as his personal mission to rewrite the history of the end of the Cold War.

This goes beyond concerns he may have about his legacy, or a desire to deliver on his promise to restore Russia to its former greatness.

This mission seems to be the real driver behind his aggression right now, not the narrative about the continued threat of NATO on Russiaâ€™s borders.

In fact, his massive troop build-up on Ukraineâ€™s borders (about 60% of Russiaâ€™s total combat power) undercuts his perceived concerns over NATO and a potential Western invasion of Russia.

This has required him to shift whole garrisons, including from near the border with Estonia and Latvia, both of which are NATO members.

He has also decreed the 30,000 Russian military personnel in Belarus will stay there indefinitely, ensuring Minsk also remains tightly bound to Moscow. This effectively adds new territory where Putin can station military forces and even potentially nuclear weapons.

Putin has calculated the economic risks

All of this indicates the conflict in Ukraine is more about expanding Russiaâ€™s territorial footprint than about the much-hyped NATO threat. In fact, it is deliberately pushing closer to NATO. And this has implications for how Putin is likely to calculate risk.

First, Putin knows NATO will not fight for Ukraine.

Second, he would have gamed out the potential costs of Western sanctions and attempts to distract him with â€œoff-rampsâ€ to avoid conflict. Putinâ€™s tactic of reducing gas supplies over the last six months, encouraging EU members to deplete their reserves during winter, is evidence his plan has been in the works for some time.

Alberto Pezzali/AP

So, too, has been his approach to diplomacy. Putinâ€™s seeming willingness to negotiate over Ukraine has clearly been a pretence, given his refusal to budge on key issues and his swift discarding of the Minsk agreements over the future status of the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Third, Russia previously adapted to sanctions the West imposed after its invasion of Crimea in 2014 by divesting from dollars into gold and building a large sovereign wealth fund. This will provide some insulation from new sanctions imposed by Western countries this week.

Putin may well calculate he will be able to ride out even a tough US and EU package. That already includes total blocks on Russian banks, Germanyâ€™s delayed certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, and hints from the Biden administration that tough export controls will be next.

How the West must respond

If Putin is undeterred by economic pressure, what about political and military risks?

It makes little sense for him to stop at securing Donetsk and Luhansk as they stand today, which is why he chose to recognise the far larger territory the separatists claim but donâ€™t yet control.

It also provides numerous opportunities for false-flag â€œprovocationsâ€, since 70% of the territory the separatists have claimed is currently held by the Ukrainian military.

But it is doubtful whether Putin would even see this as a victory.

For one thing, he could have recognised Donetsk and Luhansk months, if not years ago. For another, he did not need to surround Ukraine with virtually every offensive military asset he has â€“ including mobile missile launchers, tanks, special forces and civilian control units â€“ just to secure the two small breakaway regions.

If Ukraine is as personal for Putin as he is signalling, and his appetite for risk as high as his actions indicate, the West must assume he has loftier ambitions than the five-day war with Georgia in 2008.

That means taking decisive coercive steps in response to Russiaâ€™s aggression. At the very least, the West will need a blisteringly tough sanctions package aimed at crippling the Russian economy.

It will also need to arm Ukraine and provide technical, on-the-ground expertise, and provide signals and other intelligence to the Ukrainian armed forces.

Providing this type of support will inevitably allow Putin to claim the West pushed him into a broader war, and plenty will believe him.

But all the signs indicate that is what he wanted anyway. It is therefore vital for the sake of Western credibility â€“ and for the Ukrainians set to suffer once again from Putinâ€™s expansionist urges â€“ to ensure such behaviour does not come without significant costs.",https://theconversation.com/putin-is-on-a-personal-mission-to-rewrite-cold-war-history-making-the-risks-in-ukraine-far-graver-177730,Anti-Russian
6061,Putin marks Victory Day with little to show for 11-week war,"Putin marks Victory Day with little to show for 11-week war

Evgeny Biyatov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP

ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine â€” With no major new battlefield successes to boast about, Russian President Vladimir Putin marked his countryâ€™s biggest patriotic holiday without even uttering the word â€œUkraine.""

The Russian leader oversaw a Victory Day parade Monday on Moscow's Red Square, watching as troops marched in formation and military hardware rolled past in a celebration of the Soviet Union's role in the 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany.

Many Western analysts had expected Putin to use the holiday to trumpet some kind of victory in Ukraine or announce an escalation, but he did neither. Instead, he sought to justify the war again as a necessary response to what he portrayed as a hostile Ukraine.

â€œThe danger was rising by the day,â€ Putin said. â€œRussia has given a preemptive response to aggression. It was forced, timely, and the only correct decision.â€

With the conflict grinding through its 11th week, he steered clear of battlefield specifics, failing to mention the potentially pivotal battle for the vital southern port of Mariupol.

Meanwhile, on the ground, intense fighting raged in Ukraine's east. In the south, the vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack. And Russian forces sought to end the resistance of Ukrainian defenders making their last stand at a steel plant in Mariupol.

One of the Ukrainian fighters holding out at the steel plant said they were still defending the city.

Valeri Paditel, who heads the border guards in the Donetsk region, said the fighters were â€œdoing everything to make those who defend the city in the future proud.â€

Putin has long bristled at NATOâ€™s creep eastward into former Soviet republics. Ukraine and its Western allies have denied the country posed any threat.

As he has done all along, Putin falsely portrayed the fighting as a battle against Nazism, thereby linking the war to what many Russians consider their finest hour: the triumph over Hitler. The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in what Russia refers to as the Great Patriotic War.

After unexpectedly fierce resistance forced the Kremlin to abandon its effort to storm Kyiv over a month ago, Moscow's forces have concentrated on capturing the Donbas, Ukraine's eastern industrial region.

But the fighting there has been a back-and-forth, village-by-village slog, and analysts had suggested Putin might use his holiday speech to present the Russian people with a victory amid discontent over the country's heavy casualties and the punishing effects of Western sanctions.

Others suggested he might declare the fighting a war, not just a â€œspecial military operation,â€ and order a nationwide mobilization, with a call-up of reserves, to replenish the depleted ranks for an extended conflict.

In the end, he gave no signal as to where the war is headed or how he might intend to salvage it. Specifically, he left unanswered the question of whether or how Russia will marshal more forces for a continuing war.

â€œWithout concrete steps to build a new force, Russia canâ€™t fight a long war, and the clock starts ticking on the failure of their army in Ukraine,â€ tweeted Phillips P. Oâ€™Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.

Nigel Gould Davies, former British ambassador to Belarus, said: â€œRussia has not won this war. Itâ€™s starting to lose it.â€

He said that unless Russia has a major breakthrough, â€œthe balance of advantages will shift steadily in favor of Ukraine, especially as Ukraine gets access to growing volumes of increasingly sophisticated Western military equipment.â€

Despite Russiaâ€™s crackdown on dissent, antiwar sentiment has seeped through. Dozens of protesters were detained around the country on Victory Day, and editors at a pro-Kremlin media outlet revolted by briefly publishing a few dozen stories criticizing Putin and the invasion.

In Warsaw, antiwar protesters splattered Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Poland with what appeared to be red paint as he arrived at a cemetery to pay respects to Red Army soldiers who died during World War II.

As Putin laid a wreath in Moscow, air raid sirens echoed again in the Ukrainian capital. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared in his own Victory Day address that his country would eventually defeat the Russians.

â€œVery soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine,â€ he said in a video. He added: ""We are fighting for freedom, for our children, and therefore we will win.â€

A Zelenskyy adviser interpreted Putinâ€™s speech as indicating that Russia has no interest in escalating the war through the use of nuclear weapons or direct engagement with NATO.

Speaking late Monday in an online interview, Oleksiy Arestovych pointed to Putinâ€™s statement that Russia would honor the memory of those who fought in World War II by doing â€œeverything so that the horror of a global war does not happen again.â€

Instead, he predicted Russia would make â€œa sluggish attemptâ€ to take control of the Donbas, including Mariupol, and a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which the Kremlin seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Arestovych said Russia would drag out the war while bleeding the Ukrainian economy with the aim of getting Ukraine to agree to give up that territory.

Russia has about 97 battalion tactical groups in Ukraine, largely in the east and the south, a slight increase over last week, according to a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon's assessment. Each unit has roughly 1,000 troops, according to the Pentagon.

The official said that overall, the Russian effort in the Donbas hasnâ€™t achieved any significant progress in recent days and continues to face stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces.

Russia is perhaps closest to a victory in Mariupol. The U.S. official said roughly 2,000 Russian forces were around Mariupol, and the city was being pounded by airstrikes. As many as 2,000 Ukrainian defenders were believed to be holding out at the steel plant, the city's last stronghold of resistance.

The fall of Mariupol would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up troops to fight elsewhere in the Donbas and give the Kremlin a badly needed success.

Odesa, too, has increasingly been bombarded in recent days. The Ukrainian military said Russian forces fired seven missiles from the air at Odesa on Monday night, hitting a shopping center and a warehouse. One person was killed and five were wounded, the military said.

The war in the country long known as the â€œbreadbasket of Europeâ€ has disrupted global food supplies.

â€œI saw silos full of grain, wheat and corn ready for export,â€ Charles Michel, president of the European Council, lamented in a tweet after a visit to Odesa.

3335,Beyond sanctions: 5 more ways New Zealand can help support Ukraine and punish Russia,"The illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine has already seen New Zealand break with long diplomatic tradition and introduce an â€œautonomousâ€ sanctions regime outside the normal United Nations process.

But as the war nears the one-month mark, there is more that can be done. In particular, the New Zealand government needs to look at five potential ways it can support the Ukrainian people and government and help international efforts to punish Russian aggression.

1. Offer non-lethal military assistance

The New Zealand government actively helped the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq to defend themselves. But the current administration seems unwilling to do the same for Ukraine, despite the fact it is the victim of an illegal invasion by a superpower.

If New Zealand doesnâ€™t wish to match the kind of lethal military aid its allies are providing, it could certainly offer non-lethal military assistance: body armour, communications equipment, night-vision technology, rations, medical packs and even cyber-security tools.

It may be small-scale, but the symbolism of helping the Ukrainian defence matters. The excuse that New Zealand has no surplus kit is lamentable. It should provide whatever it has now (via Australia, which can deliver it) and restock as required. At this moment, Ukraine needs it more than New Zealand does.

2. Control New Zealanders wanting to fight

Both Ukraine and Russia are trying to internationalise the conflict by calling for foreign volunteers. Private contractors or mercenaries are also in high demand. There will undoubtedly be New Zealanders, including current or former Defence Force personnel, who are tempted to go.

While those with dual nationality (New Zealand and Ukrainian or Russian) will have some legal standing in the conflict, those without would risk execution if captured.

Current members of the New Zealand military risk being charged with mutiny if they attempt to serve a foreign power while still in uniform. Fighting as a mercenary overseas is also illegal under New Zealand law.

For New Zealanders motivated by ideology (rather than money), the government also needs to be explicit about the difference between fighting on the Ukrainian and Russian sides. One is acting like a terrorist organisation, and volunteers should be treated as such (much as New Zealand treated those leaving to join ISIS).

3. Open the door to refugees

The 2.8 million people who have already fled Ukraine is an exodus of unprecedented speed and scale. The government will need to extend its annual refugee quota (currently 1,500) and make some emergency decisions.

The recent approval of temporary sanctuary for around 4,000 family members of Ukrainians already in New Zealand is an excellent start. But the government needs to go further, with a focus on actual refugees, and commit to a number above the existing quota.

There is precedent to guide this, not least because the origins of New Zealandâ€™s refugee policy lie in the same part of the world. In 1944 New Zealand accepted 733 Polish children and 102 adults fleeing war-torn Europe (including deportation to the Soviet Union).

The present generation can do better â€“ at least double what was offered during the second world war.

4. Prepare for Russian vodka to become very expensive

Commendable as it is, the new Russian Sanctions Act, which targets specific individuals and entities supporting the Russian war effort, is only a first step.

As part of wider economic pressure already being applied internationally, New Zealand can still allow trade in some Russian products but use import duties to make them uncompetitive.

Read more: Boycotting Russian products might feel right, but can individual consumers really make a difference?

A number of countries have already started down this road, with the removal of Russiaâ€™s â€œmost favoured nationâ€ trade status. New Zealand should be prepared to act similarly â€“ and expect Russia to reply in kind against New Zealand exports.

5. Discourage anti-Russian hysteria

Despite calls by the parliamentary opposition, New Zealand should not unilaterally expel the Russian ambassador. Such actions are normally a last resort, when countries are actually at war or there has been extreme interference in the host nationâ€™s sovereignty.

In the case of Ukraine, for now at least, diplomacy has not run its course. Furthermore, itâ€™s highly likely such a step would result in the New Zealand ambassador in Moscow being made persona non grata in response. New Zealandâ€™s multiple interests in Russia would be left without official representation or support.

At a domestic level, the government should lead by example and not allow anger at Putinâ€™s aggression to harden into anti-Russian sentiment. This means clearly identifying who and what should be subject to sanctions, observing due process and acting as fairly as possible.

Most Russians with citizenship or links to New Zealand will not be sanctions targets, anyway. Many will be opposed to Putinâ€™s war. Ensuring tolerance, respect and protection is not only the right thing to do, it will help avoid reciprocal action against New Zealanders living in Russia.",https://theconversation.com/beyond-sanctions-5-more-ways-new-zealand-can-help-support-ukraine-and-punish-russia-179371,Anti-Russian

During an interview with an Italian news channel on Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was asked how he could reconcile Russia's claim to be waging war to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine with the fact that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish.

""The fact does not negate the Nazi elements in Ukraine. I believe that Hitler also had Jewish blood,"" Lavrov said, referring to a widespread theory â€” dismissed by most historians as mere rumor â€” that Hitler's paternal grandfather was Jewish.

A spokesperson for Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Monday that the MFA had ""summoned the Russian Ambassador to Israel for a clarification meeting.""

Dani Dayan, who heads Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, also spoke out against Lavrov, calling his remarks ""false, delusional and dangerous, and worthy of all condemnation."" Yad Vashem previously chided Zelensky for comparing Russia's attack on Ukraine to the Holocaust.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called Lavrov's comments ""heinous.""

FM Lavrov could not help hiding the deeply-rooted antisemitism of the Russian elites. His heinous remarks are offensive to President @ZelenskyyUa, Ukraine, Israel, and the Jewish people.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) â€” The United States plans to seek a vote this week to suspend Russia from its seat on the U.N.â€™s top human rights body, pointing to increasing signs that Russian troops may have committed war crimes in Ukraine, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Monday.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the Human Rights Council in the wake of reports over the weekend about violence against civilians in the town of Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after Russian forces pulled out. The reports have sparked a wave of outrage and condemnation against Russia.

â€œWe believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,â€ Thomas-Greenfield said at a news conference in Romaniaâ€™s capital, Bucharest.

She called Russiaâ€™s participation on the rights council a â€œfarceâ€ that â€œhurts the credibility of the council and the U.N. writ largeâ€ and is â€œsimply wrong.â€

ADVERTISEMENT

Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he spoke Monday with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres about events in Bucha and tweeted: â€œNo place for Russia on the UN Human Rights Council.â€

â€œUkraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account,â€ Kuleba said.

The 193-member U.N. General Assembly in New York has the final say, and any resolution to strip Russia of its membership rights would require support from two-thirds of member countries that vote.

Thomas-Greenfield told NPR the U.S. plans to seek a vote â€œas soon as possible this week, and possibly as early as Thursday.â€

She said her message was simple to the 140 assembly members who voted last month to condemn Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine: â€œThe images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us now to match our words with action.â€

â€œWe cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council,â€ she said.

The 47-member council is the U.N.â€™s premier human rights body, and the General Assembly decies which states hold the seats.

Russia and the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council â€” Britain, China, France, and the United States â€” all currently have seats on the rights council, which the U.S. rejoined this year.

In New York, General Assembly spokeswoman Paulina Kubiak said Monday that no request for a meeting on the issue had yet been received.

Russiaâ€™s ambassador in Geneva shot back by calling the U.S. statement â€œ(b)aseless, unfounded and purely emotional bravado that looks good on camera -- just how the US likes it.â€

ADVERTISEMENT

â€œWashington exploits the Ukrainian crisis for its own benefit in an attempt either to exclude or suspend Russia from international organizations, including the HRC here in Geneva,â€ Gennady Gatilov said, in comments relayed by a Russian diplomatic mission spokesman.

The only country to have its membership rights stripped at the council was Libya in 2011, when upheaval in the North African country brought down longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi, said council spokesman Rolando Gomez. The council started work in 2006.

No permanent member of the security council has ever had its membership revoked from any U.N. body.

Referring to the General Assembly, Gatilov said the U.S. effort â€œis unlikely to be supported by the majority of its member states.â€

Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv that have been recaptured from Russian forces in recent days.

Thomas-Greenfield said she would go to the Security Council on Tuesday on her return to New York to â€œaddress Russiaâ€™s actions firmly and directly.â€

She mentioned the U.S. plan during a bilateral meeting with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca, whose government she praised for its â€œextraordinary effortâ€ in receiving hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine. More than 600,000 refugees have fled to safety in Romania since Russia launched its invasion.

Thomas-Greenfield also visited the Romanian capitalâ€™s main train station, where she met with humanitarian workers helping to receive refugees.

Her visit to Romania came a day after she met with leaders in Chisinau, Moldovaâ€™s capital, where she announced that the U.S. will provide $50 million (45 million euros) â€œto help the Government of Moldova and its people cope with the impacts of Russiaâ€™s brutal and unprovoked war.â€

Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of around 2.6 million, has so far received around 400,000 refugees from war-torn Ukraine. The $50 million assistance is in addition to more than $30 million the U.S. has provided Moldova for its humanitarian efforts during the crisis.

6326,Is this the end of Europeâ€™s clean energy ambition?,"Russia-Ukraine conflict has served Europe a heaping dose of energy realism. While the European Union was touting a â€œno pain, all gainâ€ transition to renewable energy, many of its industries â€” particularly in Germany â€” had developed a debilitating dependence on cheap Russian gas. This revelation should be the first step toward a more realistic â€” and less dogmatic â€” European approach not only to its own energy transition, but also to that in the Global South.

The EU has an action plan for weaning itself off Russian fossil fuels. But, while the details of REPowerEU are still being finalised, it is already clear that, like so many European â€œsolutions,â€ the plan is an exercise in muddling through, exemplified by the fact that it will not be completed until 2030.

Though REPowerEU aims to accelerate the roll-out of renewables and replace gas in heating and power generation, it also depends significantly on the diversification of energy supplies.

Already, energy producers in the Global South have received pleas to help meet the EUâ€™s energy needs, which has probably prompted more than a few eye rolls. After all, countries across the developing world have endured years of European proselytising about the importance of rapid progress toward a carbon-free energy system.

Moving too rapidly to renewables?

If the EU cannot achieve this in the short term, the Global South most certainly cannot. Europe is worried that economic growth and local livelihoods will suffer if it attempts to move too rapidly to renewables. Developing economies are worried that they will have no path to sustained economic growth and poverty reduction at all.

They are right to worry. The positive correlation between baseload power and prosperity clearly shows that a reliable energy supply is essential to economic progress. But, globally, 770 million people â€” mostly in Africa and Asia â€” lack access to electricity. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the pandemic worsened energy poverty, with 77% of the regionâ€™s people now living without electricity, compared to 74% in 2019.

Given that future population growth â€” and, thus, growth in energy demand â€” will be concentrated in the Global South, this problem is set to get much worse. And, for now, renewables cannot solve it, because they do not represent a sufficiently reliable power supply. A scale-up in hydrogen fuel could change this, though this remains a stretch for emerging-market and developing economies.

United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, for one, has now recognised the folly of attempting to force developing economies to go fully renewable. On March 7, following the Russian attack on Ukraine, he acknowledged that gas would be crucial to economic development in African countries. Even the World Bank â€” without much fanfare â€” has reversed its moratorium on financing gas projects.

Historical consumption levels

Yes, this new realism implies a near-term increase in African emissions â€” but starting from a very low level. The 48 countries that comprise Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) represent 0.55% of global carbon dioxide emissions. As a whole, Africa consumes less energy than any other continent â€” far less than Europe, especially if one takes into account historical consumption.

Rich countries are well aware of this discrepancy, which is why developing countries have been increasingly critical of the developed worldâ€™s climate hypocrisy: constant pressure to cut emissions coupled with prolonged refusal to finance climate mitigation and adaptation in the Global South.

The Green Climate Fund embodies this hypocrisy. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2009, developed economies pledged to channel $100 billion per year for mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries by 2020. As of January 2022, participating countriesâ€™ pledges amounted to a measly $10 billion.

Sustainability is vital to our planetâ€™s future. But the green transition must be just. And justice demands that the Global South receive the same opportunity to develop as the North had. That will be possible only with energy security for all.

Sustainable Energy for All Forum

That is why this weekâ€™s Sustainable Energy for All Forum is so important. Stakeholders from both the public and private sectors will gather in Kigali, Rwanda, to find ways to accelerate progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goal 7: ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

This yearâ€™s Forum comes at a pivotal time in the global energy transition. Moreover, this is the first time since the Forum was launched in 2014 that it will be held in Africa. One hopes that the continentâ€™s centrality to the event â€” and the harsh realisations that the war in Ukraine has imposed on Europe â€” will be reflected in its conclusions, which, given the current crisis, will be more consequential than ever.

Europe has always prided itself on being a leader in the green-energy transition. This should not change. But, rather than allowing its vision to become clouded by idealism and ideology, the EU must ensure that its energy ambitions â€” for itself and for developing economies â€” are firmly grounded in reality. Europe must support developing countriesâ€™ efforts to adapt to climate change and achieve net-zero emissions. But it must also help them to achieve energy security. As one African minister succinctly put it, â€œWe will decarbonise, but first we have to carbonise.â€

Eastmanâ€™s Argument: Iâ€™m Not The Only One Who Recommended Trump Do A Coup!

Over the past several days, one of the arguments that ex-Trump legal adviser John Eastmanâ€™s been making is that his plot with Trump to steal the 2020 election wasnâ€™t criminal because there were other people besides Eastman who were feeding Trump conspiracies theories about voter fraud.

And since Trump heard the conspiracy theories from multiple advisers while some other advisers were telling him the conspiracy theories werenâ€™t real, Trump was just hearing a debate between two sides, Eastman argues.

Debunking GOPâ€™s Whitewashed Narrative Of Trumpâ€™s Ukraine Aid Pressure Scheme

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) would have you believe that in 2019, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thought Trump was an awesome guy and that it was totally fine for Trump to freeze U.S. aid to Ukraine because he handed it over eventually, which was a very nice thing Trump did that gave Ukrainians the help they needed to fight Russia now.

Washington Post analyst Philip Bump compares here Scaliseâ€™s rosy characterization of Trump withholding the aid to what actually happened: The then-president tried to weaponize the aid to coerce Zelensky into giving him damaging material on future 2020 challenger Joe Biden.

8685,Belarusian journalists handed jail terms in media crackdown,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) â€” Journalists of Belarusâ€™ oldest newspaper were handed prison terms Tuesday in the latest move in a relentless government crackdown on independent media.

Nasha Nivaâ€™s chief editor Yahor Martsinovich and journalist Andrey Skurko each were sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison on charges of dodging communal payments they have rejected as politically driven. Martsinovich and Skurko have remained in custody since their arrest in July.

The newspaper was blocked in July and banned as extremist in November on the 115th anniversary of its founding. The ban has exposed anyone who would publish or repost Nasha Niva materials to prison terms of up to seven years.

Most other Nasha Niva journalists have left the country and continued to publish the newspaper online, changing its domain to bypass the blocking.

Nasha Niva extensively covered the massive anti-government protests that erupted after President Alexander Lukashenko was handed a sixth term after an August 2020 presidential vote that was denounced as rigged by the opposition and the West.

Belarusian authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police. Overall, 32 Belarusian journalists are in custody, serving their sentences or awaiting trial.

Lukashenko has held on to power amid bruising Western sanctions relying on support from his main ally and sponsor Russia, which used the Belarusian territory to launch an invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.

â€œWe upheld the freedom of speech and independence of Belarus, but both have now become hollow,â€ Martsinovich said in a speech at his trial. â€œThe newspaper has survived two revolutions and two world wars during its history, and now itâ€™s witnessing another war into which Belarus was drawn.

If you know the first thing about Russian history you know that unpopular wars tend to end badly for the ruling regime. The Times claims today that Putinâ€™s folly in Ukraine has led his subjects to view him in a new, march darker light:

Russians awoke in shock after they learned that Mr. Putin, in an address to the nation that aired before 6 a.m., had ordered a full-scale assault against what Russians of all political stripes often refer to as their â€œbrotherly nation.â€ Liberal-leaning public figures who for years tried to compromise with and adapt to Mr. Putinâ€™s creeping authoritarianism found themselves reduced to posting on social media about their opposition to a war they had no way to stopâ€¦ â€œEverything that we believed turned out to be wrong,â€ said one such analyst, insisting on anonymity because he was at a loss over what to say. â€œI donâ€™t understand the motivations, the goals or the possible results,â€ said another. â€œWhat is happening is very strange.â€â€¦ Ksenia Sobchak, another television celebrity whose father was mayor of St. Petersburg and a 1990s mentor to Mr. Putin, posted on Instagram that from now on she would only â€œbelieve in the worst possible scenariosâ€ about her countryâ€™s future. Days earlier, she had praised Mr. Putin as a â€œgrown-up, adequate politicianâ€ compared to his Ukrainian and American counterparts.

Russian media had convinced its audience that U.S. claims of an imminent invasion of Ukraine were western propaganda aimed at depicting Putin as a crazed warmonger. This morning that audience woke up to find â€¦ heâ€™s a crazed warmonger. The unmistakable takeaway from the NYT story from the many Russians it quotes is â€œweâ€™re no longer sure what heâ€™s capable of.â€ Which, on the one hand, is encouraging: If Russians now view the tsar as a menace rather than a national hero, that would seem to make a populist uprising more likely.

On the other hand, â€œweâ€™re no longer sure what heâ€™s capable ofâ€ isnâ€™t what you want to hear about a man who commands the worldâ€™s largest nuclear arsenal from those who know him best.

Thereâ€™s bravery in the streets on the Ukrainian side of the border with Russia today as well. Zelensky isnâ€™t taking the cowardâ€™s way out like Ashraf Ghani did when he fled Afghanistan. To the contrary:

We will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities. â€” Ð’Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ð¼Ð¸Ñ€ Ð—ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½ÑÑŒÐºÐ¸Ð¹ (@ZelenskyyUa) February 24, 2022

There are reports of Ukrainians clearing out gun shops and arming up with AK-47s. Theyâ€™re not going to win this fight but they can take a bite out of Putinâ€™s forces by going down swinging. Anecdotal reports suggest thatâ€™s just what theyâ€™re doing:

The battle for Chernobyl that John wrote about earlier also reportedly involved â€œfierce resistance.â€ As Ukrainians shoot back, Russians protest at home, and NATO countries slap mega-sanctions on Russian industry, weâ€™re left to wonder how soon itâ€™ll be before Putinâ€™s inner circle concludes this invasion was a mistake.

That sounds like a demand for the â€œFinlandizationâ€ of Ukraine. The Ukrainian government wonâ€™t agree, Iâ€™m sure, and Putin must be sure as well. Possibly this olive branch is being extended in the knowledge that itâ€™ll be rejected so that he can then claim that he sought peace before he launches the next stage of the attack. But if Engel is right, itâ€™s noteworthy that Russia would theoretically allow Zelenskyâ€™s government to remain in place. Given how Putin has talked this week about â€œdenazifyingâ€ the country, it seemed like nothing short of regime change and subjugating the population would suffice.

3473,Capito part of US Senate delegation meeting with leaders on Ukraine,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. â€” U.S. Sen Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., is part of a coalition of senators that will visit Poland and Germany this weekend to better understand Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine and the related international response.

The group left Thursday with plans to talk with American military leaders and NATO officials about Russiaâ€™s military operation and humanitarian concerns. Capito said the delegation will return to the United States on Monday.

â€œThereâ€™s nothing like seeing it with your own ears and eyes. Not just for me to frame it for West Virginians, but also policy issues.â€ Capito told reporters Thursday.

Other legislators on the trip include Sens. Jon Ernst, R-Iowa; Susan Collins, R-Maine; John Cornyn, R-Texas; Steve Daines, R-Mont.; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; Angus King, I-Maine; Roger Marshall, R-Kan.; and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev.

â€œWeâ€™ll probably be hearing intelligence in terms of what we see going on and probably be briefed on cybersecurity attacks,â€ Capito said.

The trip follows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyâ€™s remarks Wednesday to members of Congress. Zelenskyy urged American lawmakers to do more to help Ukraineâ€™s efforts, and he asked for additional military aid and economic sanctions to force Russia to withdraw its forces. He also requested a no-fly zone over the country.

Zelenskyy, at the end of his livestreamed address, showed a video highlighting destruction from the war in his country.

â€œThe video that he played was really tough to watch,â€ Capito said. â€œIt really famed down the human tragedy that occurred in that beautiful country and those beautiful cities.â€

Capito stated the United Statesâ€™ approach to the war is split between providing military aid and assistance as well as placing sanctions on Russia, President Vladimir Putin and top officials.

â€œThere are other ways we can keep sanctioning and ratcheting down,â€ she added. â€œI think there is a belief â€” and I believe this to be true â€” that the way to get to the end of this is to have the Russian people rise up and tell their leader that heâ€™s killing people, killing their own forces, and itâ€™s time for him to leave.â€

The Biden administration has placed multiple sanctions on Russia and its leaders; the president last week signed an executive order banning the import of Russian fossil fuels, including oil and liquefied natural gas. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., introduced a bill earlier this month to block such imports, which Capito sponsored.

â€œWe can hurt them even more by cutting off not just energy, but dollars into all kinds of other commodities,â€ Capito said.

President Joe Biden announced Wednesday an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine that includes anti-aircraft systems, firearms and ammunition, and drones. The White House opposes a no-fly zone with the hope of stopping the conflict from escalating.

Capito said the president should be more active in addressing the military conflict, arguing Biden has acted in response to congressional actions and NATO when he should lead discussions about stopping the military conflict.

â€œIn my view, the Biden administration and the president himself have been leading from behind,â€ she contended.

Another area of concern for Capito is the number of Ukrainian refugees. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 3.1 million Ukrainians have fled the country to avoid the conflict.

â€œTo me, some of the most poignant images I have seen are the baby carriages on the Poland border,â€ she said. â€œThat just shows you that there are a lot of good people in this world, and being a mother myself, that really touched me.â€

Biden last week signed a $1.5 trillion package which included $13.6 billion to support Ukraine. Manchin and Capito voted for the spending bill.

Other members of West Virginiaâ€™s congressional delegation shared their support of Ukraine on social media following Zelenskyyâ€™s address. Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., described the speech as a â€œpowerful and moving message for peace.â€ Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., stated the United States stands with Ukraine â€œagainst Putinâ€™s evil.â€

1735,Blinken condemns Russian strikes killing Ukrainian civilians,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned Russia for killing Ukrainian civilians in its strikes around the country, questioning whether the nation should be allowed to remain on the United Nations Human Rights Council.

In Blinkenâ€™s Tuesday speech before the council, he pointed to attacks on â€œcivilian buses, cars, even ambulancesâ€ in attacks the U.N. says have killed at least 100 people.

â€œReports of Russiaâ€™s human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law are mounting by the hour,â€ Blinken said.

â€œRussian strikes are hitting schools, hospitals, residential buildings, are destroying critical infrastructure, which provides millions of people across Ukraine with drinking water [and] gas to keep them from freezing to death.â€

U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Monday said figures on casualties are likely to tick â€œconsiderably higherâ€ along with estimates of those wounded, which now sits at 304.

Blinken characterized Russiaâ€™s invasion as an â€œunprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine, violating international law, flouting the core principles of international peace and security and creating a human rights and humanitarian crisis.â€

But he said the abuses are not just limited to Ukraine, noting that Russian authorities have arrested thousands of protesters along with journalists covering the demonstrations.

â€œ[One] can reasonably ask whether a U.N. member state that tries to take over another U.N. member state while committing horrific human rights abuses and causing massive humanitarian suffering should be allowed to remain on this council,â€ Blinken said.

1811,Rep. McGovern Will Not Be 'Lectured' By The Likes Of Kevin McCarthy,"GOP Minority Leader (god, I love typing that) Kevin McCarthy was acting all pious on the House floor about supporting Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky in his country's epic battle against Russia's invading army. He even took pot-shots at Pres. Joe Biden for offering Zelensky safe passage out of his country, which he refused. Then McCarthy acted like he wants us to stop buying oil and gas from Russia. HAR.

""I'll be watching. I think America will be watching. Will we stand for America and for freedom?"" McCarthy asked, as if he wasn't pandering to traitorous insurrectionists who just over a year ago tried to violently overturn a free and fair presidential election.

""Will we stand with President Zelensky, who didn't take the advice of President Biden and leave his country?"" McCarthy continued. ""Who doesn't ask for men and women from America to come to fight. He just asks to provide some weapons so they can defend against Putin. The sad part about that, Mr. Speaker, every day that we allow crude and natural gas to come from Russia, American money is going to Putin. Let's stop that, and stop that today.""

Gross.

Democrat from Massachusetts, Rep. Jim McGovern couldn't stomach the hypocrisy of that display, and stood up to counter it.

""Yeah, Mr. Speaker, the world IS watching. And I'm not going to be lectured by someone who takes their marching orders from Donald Trump, who said that Putin's invasion of Ukraine was a genius and savvy move. I wish the gentleman would have condemned that,"" he said, using the overly broad definition of ""gentleman"" so required by House etiquette.

""And listening to that speech, you would think that Joe Biden invaded Ukraine. I mean, he spent all this time criticizing Joe Biden, John Kerry, and everybody else, but hardly criticized Vladimir Putin. You know, look, I also wish, because I wish it would be helpful, for this country and a signal to the world, if the gentleman who just spoke would reprimand members of his own party who cozy up to white nationalists, and go to pro-Putin rallies. That would send a signal to people in this country, and to people around the world on whose side we're on.""

3282,Pence seeks to set himself apart from Trump by speaking out against Putin,"By Gabby Orr and Michael Warren, CNN

The days of Mike Pence defending Donald Trumpâ€™s controversial praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin are over, sources close to the former vice president told CNN.

Days after Pence condemned â€œapologists for Putinâ€ in reference to Trump and other Republicans who have made positive comments about the Russian dictator amid his devastating invasion of Ukraine, the former vice presidentâ€™s allies said he feels compelled to share his own long-held opinions on the matter, which he refrained from doing publicly during his time as Trumpâ€™s second-in-command.

As Pence prepares for a possible White House bid in 2024, the Russian invasion has provided him with a new opportunity to distinguish himself from Trump and underscore the foreign policy chops heâ€™s developed over two decades in government. That separation is also coming at a time when Pence is ramping up his political activities through his Advancing American Freedom group â€” from raising money for Republican candidates in the 2022 midterm elections and launching TV ads targeting vulnerable Democrats to releasing a â€œfreedom agendaâ€ for conservatives to utilize in upcoming elections.

Pence has been looking for opportunities to denounce what he perceives to be an alarming trend inside the GOP of Trump-aligned figures expressing adulation for the Kremlin leader, according to one person familiar with his thinking.

â€œWhen you are vice president, there is an obligation to support the presidentâ€™s policies and when you disagree, to share those disagreements in private. Now, there isnâ€™t that same constraint, so [Pence] can be more vocal about his viewpoints,â€ this person said.

Those around Pence say his stepping out on Ukraine reflects that the Indiana Republican has his â€œown voiceâ€ and a distinct political brand from the former President he served.

That was on display last week during his visit to the Ukraine-Poland border with Samaritanâ€™s Purse, an evangelical international relief agency run by Franklin Graham. And his long-standing party loyalty gave Pence a prime speaking spot at this monthâ€™s Republican National Committee donor retreat in New Orleans, where he plainly declared, â€œThere is no room in this party for apologists for Putin. There is only room for champions of freedom.â€

Then, on Wednesday, Pence again took aim at the Russian leader in an interview with Fox News, saying that Putin is fully responsible for the devastation and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.

â€œThere is one person to blame for this invasion. Itâ€™s Vladimir Putin, and Putin must pay for the violence,â€ Pence told the network shortly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a virtual address to members of Congress.

Though Pence declined to mention Trump by name in his New Orleans appearance, his sharp rebuke came on the heels of the former President calling Putin â€œsavvyâ€ and â€œgeniusâ€ as the Russian leader launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Those comments have left Trump isolated from other Republican leaders â€” including many of his own allies â€” who have refused to echo his praise and instead unambiguously denounced Putinâ€™s actions.

â€œI do not think anythingâ€™s savvy or genius with Putin,â€ House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has remained close to Trump since the former President left office, told reporters last week. â€œI think Putin is evil. He is a dictator. And I think heâ€™s murdering people right now.â€

One person close to Pence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said his team felt the donor retreat in early March presented â€œthe right opportunityâ€ for him to address Trumpâ€™s comments at a moment where â€œthe vast majorityâ€ of Republicans disagree with his take on Putin. This person said Pence will continue to speak out against those who praise the Russian leader within the GOP â€œto the extent that it continues to be an issue.â€

â€œThe nation has coalesced around the idea that Putin is a thug, that he is evil and that what he is doing is reprehensible,â€ this person said.

Recent polling supports that assessment, including a CNN poll in late February that found overwhelming support among Americans for economic sanctions against Russia, including from 84% of Republicans. A Quinnipiac poll from the same time found that just 6% of Republicans have favorable views of Putin.

â€œItâ€™s a smart move, because the former President is completely out of step with the party and the country when it comes to Putin, and itâ€™s one of the few issues everyone is willing to push away from Trump on,â€ said David Kochel, a veteran Republican strategist.

Pence â€˜has his own voiceâ€™

Although he has taken issue with Trumpâ€™s recent positive comments about Putin, Pence has echoed the former Presidentâ€™s criticism of his successor.

In the same speech to GOP donors, Pence accused President Joe Biden of squandering â€œthe deterrence that our administration put in place to keep Putin and Russia from even trying to redraw international boundaries by force.â€ And like Trump, the former vice president has called on the Biden administration to sanction Russian oil exports.

Still, Penceâ€™s recent comments mark a far cry from how he had typically weighed in as Trumpâ€™s running mate and vice president when he would comment on Putin or Russia. For years, as Trump lavished praise on Putin, his fiercely loyal vice president would surface soon afterward to reframe Trumpâ€™s comments to make them more palatable.

For instance, when Trump said during a 2016 campaign appearance that Putin had been â€œa leader far more thanâ€ then-President Barack Obama, Pence quickly insisted it wasnâ€™t an endorsement of the Russian autocrat. Addressing the matter during his vice presidential debate against Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Pence recast Trumpâ€™s comments as â€œan indictment of the weak and feckless leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama,â€ while describing Putin as â€œsmallâ€ and â€œbullying.â€

Then, when Trump appeared to equate US actions with Putinâ€™s authoritarian regime during a Fox interview early in his presidency, Pence assured Americans that Trump was not drawing â€œa moral equivalency.â€

â€œThere are a lot of killers. You think our countryâ€™s so innocent?â€ Trump said during the interview in response to a question about why he respects Putin even though the Russian leader is a â€œkiller.â€

And when the then-President sided with Putin over US intelligence officials during their 2018 joint news conference in Helsinki, Finland â€” suggesting at the time that he didnâ€™t â€œsee any reason whyâ€ Russia would have interfered in the 2016 US presidential election despite widespread evidence to the contrary â€” Pence rushed to defend the â€œhistoric tripâ€ and lauded Trumpâ€™s commitment â€œto put the prosperity and security of America first.â€

Pence allies say he has always bristled at praise of Putin inside the GOP but is now in a place where he can share long-held opinions publicly without breaching decorum. So far, these allies said Pence hasnâ€™t received any blowback for crossing Trump on the Putin matter and noted that he has been in regular contact with a range of foreign policy and national security experts as he decides how and when to weigh in on the Ukraine-Russia crisis.

â€œMike Pence does have his own voice, his own opinions and his own views,â€ said one of the people close to the former vice president.

Ukraine is not the first area where Pence has sought to draw a contrast with Trump. At the top of the list are their divergent views of the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and Penceâ€™s refusal to halt certification of the 2020 election. In recent weeks, Pence has been increasingly vocal in defending his refusal to delay the counting of electoral votes, as Trump and some of his top allies pressured him to do.

Speaking at the Federalist Society Florida Chapters conference near Orlando last month, Pence called Trumpâ€™s efforts to challenge the results of the election â€œun-Americanâ€ and warned against conservatives who continue to insist that the vice president can alter an election. He has periodically said that he and Trump will never see â€œeye to eyeâ€ on January 6.

Afterward, Pence fielded calls from donors, Republican lawmakers and top conservative leaders eager to privately applaud him.

2217,An uprising in Kherson,"Putinâ€™s theory of how Russia would pacify a conquered Ukraine appears to have been that Ukrainians would â€¦ just sort of pacify themselves. Russia canâ€™t mount an effective long-term occupation of a country this large but it wouldnâ€™t need to, provided that Ukrainians placidly accepted their fate and welcomed their integration into Russia.

Itâ€™s no exaggeration to say that Russiaâ€™s entire war strategy rested on that dubious assumption bearing out. If Ukrainians resisted and forced Russia to commit to a lengthy pacification effort, thereâ€™s no telling how long Moscow would be able to sustain it. Especially with western sanctions taking a wrecking ball to their economy.

To put it another way, Putin really, truly seems to have believed his own bullsh*t about Ukrainians greeting Russian troops as liberators. In a worst-case scenario, he may have imagined that Ukrainians would resist initially but then would roll over once their cities were occupied and all hope of expelling the invader was lost.

That theory was tested today in the southern city of Kherson, the site of Russiaâ€™s most significant victory to date. The Russian military seized it days ago and moved in to occupy it. If Putin is right that Ukrainians will reconcile themselves to their fate once they fall under Russian control, the first evidence should emerge in Kherson.

His theory looked shaky yesterday. Today it looks shakier:

How will Russia ever defeat these people?

No one doubts that Putin is sadistic enough to kill every last resister in order to assert his dominance over Ukraine. A ceasefire agreement between the two sides to allow civilians to evacuate from besieged Mariupol has already fallen apart, in fact, with Ukraine accusing the Russian military of attacking residential areas. No matter how ruthless Putin is willing to be, though, many observers increasingly doubt whether he has the ability to impose his will on Ukrainians:

As the money runs out and Russian troops grow more demoralized, itâ€™s anyoneâ€™s guess how long the offensive can endure. Take a minute to read Trent Telenkoâ€™s assessment of the now-famous Russian military convoy thatâ€™s stalled outside of Kiev. Thereâ€™s no complicated explanation for why it isnâ€™t moving, he argues. Itâ€™s as simple as the front of the convoy being out of fuel and stuck in the mud as spring temperatures in Ukraine thaw the ground. Russia has been trying to resupply it, but in order to do that they need to seize the Hostomel airfield. And despite numerous attempts to do so, the Ukrainians keep fending them off.

The convoy canâ€™t gas up so it canâ€™t move, and meanwhile the Russian troops who are part of it are running out of food. Telenkoâ€™s assessment:

The Russians have formed the worldâ€™s longest POW camp. And the Ukrainians donâ€™t have to feed it. There simply hasnâ€™t been anything like this in warfare since the Anglo-American Anzio beachhead in 1944. 11/ pic.twitter.com/PslIQ30KNx â€” Trent Telenko (@TrentTelenko) March 4, 2022

If Russia had air superiority in Ukraine, members of the convoy could at least feel reassured that they wonâ€™t be attacked from the air. But we all know how thatâ€™s going. The clock is ticking on them.

Meanwhile, this curious scene played out in Moscow today:

Images of Putin seated 30 feet away from his advisors, ostensibly as a COVID precaution, have become commonplace. Yet here he is cheek by jowl with Russian flight attendants, all of them unmasked. (Although no doubt vaccinated and tested before being granted an audience with the tsar.) If Putin is willing to tolerate close quarters with them, why isnâ€™t he willing to tolerate it with his own deputies?

One popular theory on social media today is that heâ€™s keeping his distance from men not because he fears COVID but because he fears they might murder him. Thatâ€™s a comforting thought but I donâ€™t buy it. He kept his distance from foreign leaders like Macron and Scholz too when they visited last month. Surely heâ€™s not worried about an assassination attempt by the president of France.

Itâ€™s more likely that Putin resents the flattering coverage Zelensky has received for his wartime leadership. Zelensky refused to leave Kiev, heâ€™s visited his troops in the field, and heâ€™s frequently pictured side by side with his advisors. Heâ€™s a hands-on executive who consistently communicates solidarity with his people, suffering alongside them. Putin is the opposite, fantastically wealthy, aloof from Russian society, and physically distanced even from his own aides. Todayâ€™s photo op highlighting his proximity to Russian flight attendants â€” whose industry has been devastated by western sanctions, by the way â€” is likely a PR stunt aimed at improving his image domestically.

8675,Members of the Global Left Turn out to Be 'Putin Stooges',"One of the dumber talking points over the last month regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the idea that masses of Republicans are â€œPutin stooges,â€ doing his bidding with their rhetoric and policy positions. Polling has shown that to be a ridiculous contention, with GOP voters matching or outpacing Democrats in regards to denouncing the Russian dictatorâ€™s actions.

But as it turns out, leftwingers across the globe have been doing â€œPutinâ€™s biddingâ€ on a key topic that helped lead Europe to its current crisis. According to The Sun, Russia spent millions of dollars trashing fracking as a way to make its oil and natural gas exports more lucrative on the world market.

How Putin spent millions spreading fake news about fracking My latest article: https://t.co/OBR4cV0abs â€” Matt Ridley (@mattwridley) March 15, 2022

Russian support for anti-fracking campaigns over the past decade took the form of public comments from the Kremlinâ€™s cronies, a blizzard of scare stories on the Russia Today TV channel, some overt political lobbying by the countryâ€™s Gazprom and Russian money almost certainly finding its way into the coffers of environmental pressure groups. In 2011 Gazprom, a firm with a mixed environmental record, claimed wrongly: â€œThe production of shale gas is associated with significant environmental risks, in particular the hazard of surface and underground water contamination with chemicals.â€ Alexander Medvedev, the general director of Gazprom Export, said fracking would never work in Europe. But just in case it did, he added in a speech in Brussels that the Russian state was â€œready to wage its war on shaleâ€â€¦ â€¦In just six months Russia Today ran scores of anti-shale stories, with headlines like: â€œWrecking the Earth: Fracking has grave radiation risks few talk aboutâ€, â€œFracking fluid linked to fish die-offâ€, â€œUS fracking wells annually produce 280bn gallons of toxic waste water destroying environmentâ€, â€œWe say no to shale gasâ€, â€œFracking nightmareâ€, â€œFracking chemicals disrupt human hormone functions, study claimsâ€, â€œLiving near fracking sites increases infant birth defectsâ€, â€œHundreds gather for anti-fracking march in Manchesterâ€.

Well, isnâ€™t that interesting? Russia has long spread misinformation about fracking despite the fact that itâ€™s a safer and far cleaner way to extract oil and gas than conventional drilling (i.e. what Russia does). Yet, instead of accepting that reality, the global left has helped spread Putinâ€™s propaganda, which has emboldened and enriched Russia while making Europe energy-dependent on the controversial nation.

The entire crisis in Ukraine (and more broadly, in Europe) was built off the back of dependence on Russian energy. If Putin didnâ€™t have so many European nations over a barrel, with the ability to crash their economies and cost lives by cutting off oil and gas supplies, he never would have had the leverage to enter Ukraine in the first place. Yet, the greens, so obsessed with pretending fracking is dangerous, did Putinâ€™s dirty work for him, effectively ending the practice in Europe outside of the Nordic countries.

You can also look at the United States as an example of this happening as well. Leftwingers in the states have spent over a decade insisting that fracking poisons water and causes fire to shoot out of faucets. There is no actual evidence of that, yet such claims have formed the backbone of Democrat opposition to fracking, an opposition that has reached the highest levels of government.

In the end, nothing has empowered Vladimir Putin more than that. So tell me again, who are the â€œPutin stoogesâ€ now?",https://redstate.com/bonchie/2022/03/15/members-of-the-global-left-turn-out-to-be-putin-stooges-n536267,Neutral
2735,"UPDATE 2-Russia shows 'reckless disregard' for Ukraine civilians, U.S. spy chiefs say","* Artillery, PGMs said to strike Ukrainian hospitals, apartments

* Chinese and U.S. intelligence surprised by stout resistance

* Fears of ""escalation"" if U.S. tranfers Polish MiGs (Adds comment from Berrier on weapons, Burns on China)

By Patricia Zengerle and Jonathan Landay

WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Russian forces are operating with ""reckless disregard"" for civilians as they face stronger-than-expected resistance in Ukraine, and American intelligence agencies are tracking their actions to hold them to account, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said on Thursday.

""The Russian military has begun to loosen its rules of engagement to achieve their military objectives,"" Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing on worldwide threats to U.S. security.

Haines, a Cabinet-level official who heads the U.S. intelligence agencies, said intelligence officers were documenting Russia's actions in order to hold to account both the government in Moscow and individuals responsible for assaults on civilians.

""Russian forces are, at the very least, operating with reckless disregard for the safety of civilians as Russian units launch artillery and airstrikes into urban areas - as they have done in cities across Ukraine,"" said Haines, the main intelligence adviser to President Joe Biden.

U.S. officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have offered support to calls for an international war crimes investigation into Russia's invasion.

They cite examples including the bombing of a maternity hospital in the southern city of Mariupol. Russia shifted its stance over the hospital bombing, with a mix of statements on Thursday that veered between aggressive denials and a call by the Kremlin to establish clear facts.

Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the U.S. military's Defense Intelligence Agency, said Russia was using missiles, artillery, multiple rocket launchers and some precision-guided weapons in strikes on Ukrainian hospitals and apartment blocks.

Story continues

Russia has denied targeting civilians. It calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. Ukraine and its allies say that is a baseless pretext to invade a country of 44 million people.

UKRAINIAN RESISTANCE

Three weeks into the conflict, Haines and the other intelligence leaders said Russia was surprised by the strength of Ukrainian resistance. Haines said the resistance deprived Russia of a quick victory it thought would have prevented the United States and NATO from providing meaningful military aid.

Republican senators asked repeated questions about the rejection by Democrat Biden's administration of accept Poland's offer of its Russian-made MiG fighter jets for eventual transfer to Ukraine.

Berrier said providing combat aircraft would move the United States further up ""the escalation ladder"" than sending equipment like anti-tank and air defense systems.

The intelligence chiefs also said they thought China, which has refused to condemn Russia or call the attack an invasion, was ""unsettled"" by events in Ukraine.

""I do believe that the Chinese leadership, President Xi (Jinping) in particular, is unsettled,"" Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said. ""By what he's seen, partly because his own intelligence doesn't appear to have told him what was going to happen.""

The hearing featured unusually blunt admissions that initial U.S. assessments about Ukraineâ€™s ability were off.

While U.S. spy agencies assessed before the invasion that Russian President Vladimir Putin was under-estimating the Ukrainiansâ€™ â€œlikely resistance,â€ they did not do as well predicting the military challenges that Russia would face, Haines said.

Berrier said he initially believed the Ukrainians ""were not as ready as I thought they should be. Therefore, I questioned their will to fight. That was a bad assessment on my part because they have fought bravely and honorably.""

1203,Even Tuckerâ€™s Lawyers Donâ€™t Think He Should Be Taken Seriously,"As weâ€™ve noted in our live coverage of Russiaâ€™s declaration of war and subsequent full-scale military attack on Ukraine in the last 24 hours, there is a schism growing in the Republican Party on whether Vladimir Putin is a mortal enemy, or a brilliant friend. The wildly divergent thinking within the GOP has been on display repeatedly in recent days and weeks.

The hawkish, more traditional wing â€” to the extent it has survived the MAGA onslaught â€” is today condemning Putinâ€™s actions and calling for tougher sanctions on Russia. The Trump adherents are taking cues from their leader, applauding the invasion and demonizing Ukraine as some sort of failed democratic pet project of the United Statesâ€™. All sides have a common straw man at which they direct their ire: President Biden, with his administrationâ€™s supposed foreign policy weakness.

But few have taken the Trumpian affinity for Putin as far as Fox News host Tucker Carlson â€” not even Trump himself. In the days leading up to Putinâ€™s declaration of war, Carlson downplayed Russiaâ€™s weeks-long campaign of aggression and threats toward Ukraine as a mere â€œborder dispute,â€ while challenging viewers to dig deep within themselves and question why they â€œhateâ€ the Russian president so much.

â€œIt may be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious, what is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much?â€ he wondered Tuesday night. â€œHas Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?â€

He then went on to ask viewers whether Putin was responsible for a litany of Republican grievances â€” has he pushed â€œracial discriminationâ€ in public schools? Tried â€œto snuff out Christianityâ€ in the United States? Or eaten â€¦ dogs? (I donâ€™t really have an origin point for this one.) All, apparently, in the hope of leading readers to the conclusion that the Russian president, who was in the process of starting the first land war in Europe in decades, was not a cause for concern. The real enemy, one might conclude, was Biden/Democrats/the radical left/probably AOC.

â€œThese are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is â€˜no.â€™ Vladimir Putin didnâ€™t do any of that,â€ he said. â€œSo, why does permanent Washington hate him so much?â€

Even before last nightâ€™s invasion, some Republicans in the vestiges of the GOP establishment criticized Carlsonâ€™s trolly perspective on Putin. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) told Politico last month that Carlson is â€œobviouslyâ€ not the right person to rely upon to address the matter in any serious way.

â€œHeâ€™s obviously not in a position of being responsible for those decisions,â€ Cornyn told Politico. â€œAnd we are.â€

It just so happens, as Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan reminded us today, Carlsonâ€™s own lawyers agree.

Sullivan surfaced a crucial anecdote in her coverage of Putinâ€™s war today, reminding readers that Carlsonâ€™s lawyers argued â€” and a federal judge concurred â€” in 2020 that Carlson is hardly an arbiter of â€œactual facts.â€ And that comments made on his high-ratings show should not be taken seriously.

Sullivan:

U.S. District Court Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil echoed Foxâ€™s own arguments in finding that Carlson didnâ€™t commit slander when he accused a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, of extortion, after the National Enquirer bought her story of an affair with Trump and then promptly shelved it on his behalf. Why not? Because, Vyskocil decided, the whole tenor of Carlsonâ€™s show makes it clear to viewers that he is not stating â€œactual factsâ€ about his topics. â€œWhether the Court frames Mr. Carlsonâ€™s statements as â€˜exaggeration,â€™ â€˜non-literal commentary,â€™ or simply bloviating for his audience,â€ she wrote, â€œthe conclusion remains the same â€” the statements are not actionable.â€ She added: â€œFox persuasively argues, that given Mr. Carlsonâ€™s reputation, any reasonable viewer â€˜arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticismâ€™ about the statement he makes.â€

Perhaps Tucker Carlson is not meant to be taken seriously. But, of course, he also very much is. He is a â€” and perhaps the â€” leading voice of an American ideological movement as the U.S. faces down a series of crises, of which Putinâ€™s war is just the latest. While at least one side of the GOPâ€™s current schism is bear hugging pro-Putinism, the leading voice in that problematic faction is not even pretending to be anything more than a shock-jock big boy, a hyperbolic entertainer.

And viewers, it would seem, are not arriving at their TV sets for primetime happy hour â€œwith an appropriate amount of skepticismâ€ about the statements he makes.

4174,Jozef Opdeweegh On Defending The Values Of Resolution,"MIAMI, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 28, 2022 / When we think of the most common company values, we oftentimes reflect on predictable standards such as integrity, teamwork, accountability, innovation, speed, and fairness. Jozef Opdeweegh , a seasoned C-suite executive and author, echoes the predictability of the most common company values and phrases.

Opdeweegh states that conveying and fostering employee and customer-centric standards have come to typify modern organizations. Nevertheless, Opdeweegh recognizes a particular value that has resurfaced more recently in this world where countless points of view a shared and widely reflect the echo of political and moral adversaries, make humanity aware of a word that has been conspicuously absent from every search he made regarding this topic: resolve.

More particularly, resolve when used as a noun rather than as a verb can refer to something of the opposite, implying compromise or reconciliation of conflicting positions. The distinction is not a bad thing in itself, but one mustnâ€™t conflate the two meanings. Thankfully, most recognize resolute people when encountering them, just as they do in steadfast organizations or even nation-states.

ADVERTISEMENT

Indeed, Joef Opdeweeghâ€™s idea of nation-states has rarely been more appropriate. The newfound unity of the West in the face of Russiaâ€™s evil invasion of Ukraine has been described as a wake-up call for values, reminding people of the criticality of the commitment to liberty, freedom, and the rule of law. In many ways, these principles are the societal equivalent to the company and organizational values that are now so commonplace. And yet, as recent events are showing, they are nothing, without the determination to see them through when tested.

Often in Jozef Opdeweeghâ€™s career, he has seen companies with well-formulated values seek their adjustment-temporary or otherwise-most usually in the name of pragmatism or expedience. He speaks on this idea and says â€œI know from first-hand experience that the temptation to do so can be great, especially when the markets or shareholders are exerting pressure.â€ He continues by saying â€œIâ€™ve learned too that sticking to your guns can be lonely and personally costly, which is why periods of crisis carry the archetypal risk of seeking a resolution by abandoning our resolve!â€

ADVERTISEMENT

Jozef Opdeweegh is not such an idealist as to deny that there may genuinely be occasions for pragmatism. His hard-won observation is that compromising values typically amounts to short-term convenience at significant long-term cost. This is why great brands protect their quality and reputation above all else, knowing that customer trust which takes years to build can be lost in an instant. And itâ€™s also why Boards (and Governments) have a special responsibility to live by the ethics they espouse, guarding them jealously with a determination that can weather the inevitable economic and political storms.

In this respect, resolve is like stamina to convictions; without it, one may appear fit for purpose, but no sooner does the pace quicken and fatigue will begin to show. To acquire resilience, Jozef Opdeweegh believes someone must practice and persevere and must be committed to meeting the challenges they know will come; and perhaps most of all, one must be prepared for some pain in the process. The alternative is that people are paper tigers, deluded by posturing, yet inwardly weak and ineffective.

â€œThe times we are living through are, I believe, a bellwether, not only of all that we have stood for since the dawn of democracy but of our courage to defend those values when the prospect of a pragmatic alternative might appear more tempting,â€ Opdeweegh, says. He continues on this thought by saying, â€œIf we fail as nations, as companies and individuals to take and bear the consequences of the actions that are necessary, then we will pay a much greater price in the long run-not just in freedom or in economic dependency, but in our dignity and ultimately, our destiny too.â€

This is the critical role of resolve as a noun; the point where steadfastness meets the sense of who someone is and who someone wants to be. More than ever people need to find it not in Google searches or company websites, but deep in their DNA. For it applies to everyone, not just those who lead, but those whose frontline actions make a difference every day. Jozef Opdeweegh ends his thoughts on this topic by saying, â€œThe streets of Ukraine are testament to this fact; so too I hope will be the way we judge our leaders and those businesses we wish to work within future.â€ On that matter, he is resolved.

The US will keep 100,000 troops in Europe for the foreseeable future unless the tensions between Russia and Sweden and Finland or other NATO allies escalate into something bigger, CNN reported, citing a number of Washington insiders. According to the report, the number of troops stationed in the region might rise for a short time if NATO conducts more military exercises, and the US could expand its presence in Europe if the security situation changes.The measures were brought into discussion after NATO military chiefs met in Brussels on Thursday, per the outlet.The announcement is believed to be expected at the June's NATO summit in Madrid, as NATO and US leaders have reportedly hinted at a more permanent change in European troop posture in reaction to Russia's special military operation in Ukraine. The 100,000-troop level has been expected to be agreed upon at the summit for some time. Last month, Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin warned US legislators the Ukraine conflict would alter the US military footprint in Europe.The move is reportedly in line with what not only the defense secretary but what several other top military officers have told US legislators. As a response to the current events in Ukraine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told members of Congress in April that he supported the establishment of permanent US outposts in Eastern Europe. But he noted, still, that US soldiers at those bases may be rotated, since Washington does not need to station soldiers there indefinitely to constitute an effective deterrent, according to the general.The Pentagon, has recently announced over 10,000 replacement soldiers for those temporary rotations, indicating that the expanded US presence will continue for some time.As Sweden and Finland prepare to join NATO, US officials reportedly believe that extra forces will not be required until Russia poses a direct danger to the two Nordic nations. The force posture could be reconsidered in case Russia moves its weapons closer or makes serious threats to move weaponry closer, according to the report.Sweden and Finland have raised concerns about their security in the interim after submitting their membership applications, and have requested further security assistance from NATO allies while the process is underway. The majority of NATO countries have supported Finland and Sweden's membership applications, although Turkey has raised issues, virtually blocking their admission.Moreover, officials told CNN there will be ongoing staff level discussions regarding Sweden's needs and how the US might help meet them, and that Washington has also engaged Finland in similar staff level discussions. Insiders stressed the request for enhanced security needs might not result in additional US soldiers, since the US might conduct additional military drills with Sweden or Finland instead.As of now, already thousands of US troops are stationed in Europe on temporary rotations, as additional military assets have been sent to the Eastern flank to support eight new NATO battlegroups. Additionally, US and NATO partners have allocated billions in military aid to Ukraine.

* Russian assaults in east repulsed

* Rockets destroy Dnipro airport

* Austria's Nehammer to meet Putin in Moscow on Monday

* World Bank forecasts 45% drop in Ukraine GDP output

By Maria Starkova

LVIV, Ukraine, April 11 (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops have repulsed several Russian assaults in the country's east, the focus of a new offensive by the invading forces, British intelligence said on Monday, while President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said this week will be crucial to the course of the war.

Austrian leader Karl Nehammer planned to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday and will call for an end to the conflict. It would be Putin's first face-to-face meeting with a European Union leader since Russia's invasion started on Feb. 24.

Russian forces were also pushing their offensive to establish control over the southern port city of Mariupol, a key target whose capture would link up areas of Russian control to the west and east.

The Russian invasion has left a trail of death of destruction that has drawn condemnation from Western countries and triggered concern about Putin's broader ambitions.

About a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million population have been forced from their homes, cities turned into rubble, and thousands of people have been killed or injured - many of them civilians.

Russian forces have abandoned their attempt to capture the capital Kyiv but are redoubling their efforts in Ukraine's east. Britain's defence ministry said Russian shelling continued in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Ukrainian forces had beaten back several assaults and destroyed Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery equipment, it said in its regular intelligence bulletin.

The report also said Russia's continued reliance on unguided bombs greatly increased the risk of further civilian casualties.

Powerful explosions rocked cities in the south and east and air raid sirens blared out across Ukraine early on Monday.

Story continues

""IT MUST STOP"" President Zelenskiy kept up his tireless campaign to generate international support and rally his countrymen, warning the coming week would be important and tense.

""Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They may use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs. But we are preparing for their actions. We will answer."" he said in a late night video address.

He was due to address South Korea's parliament by videolink on Monday.

The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said it was likely the Russians would try to disrupt supply lines and strike at transport infrastructure.

Russia's defence ministry said high-precision missiles had destroyed the headquarters of Ukraine's Dnipro battalion in the town of Zvonetsky.

Reuters could not immediately confirm the reports.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he would meet Putin on Monday in Moscow.

""We are militarily neutral, but (have) a clear position on the Russian war of aggression against #Ukraine,"" Nehammer wrote on Twitter https://twitter.com/karlnehammer/status/1513193093784297476. ""It must stop! It needs humanitarian corridors, ceasefire & full investigation of war crimes.""

Since Russia invaded, Zelenskiy has appealed to Western powers to provide more defence help, and to punish Moscow with tougher sanctions including embargoes on its energy exports.

Zelenskiy said he had confidence in his own armed forces but ""unfortunately I don't have the confidence that we will be receiving everything we need"" from the United States.

CIVILIAN TOLL

Mounting civilian casualties have triggered widespread international condemnation and new sanctions.

Ludmila Zabaluk, head of the Dmytriv Village Department, north of Kyiv, said dozens of civilian bodies were found in the area.

""There were more than 50 dead people. They shot them from close distance. There's a car where a 17-year-old child was burned, only bones left. A woman had half her head blown off. A bit farther, a man lying near his car was burned alive.â€

Reuters could not immediately confirm the reports.

Moscow has rejected accusations of war crimes by Ukraine and Western countries. It has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour. Ukraine and Western nations have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for war.

ECONOMIC COST

French bank Societe Generale became the latest company to retreat from Russia, agreeing to sell its stake in Rosbank and the Russian lenderâ€™s insurance subsidiaries to Interros Capital, a firm linked to billionaire Vladimir Potanin.

The Russian invasion has triggered a barrage of financial sanctions from the United States, Europe and Britain, prompting Western companies to sell their Russian assets.

SocGen had faced mounting pressure to cut ties with Russia and end its more than 15-year investment in Rosbank.

The World Bank on Sunday forecast the war would cause Ukraine's economic output to collapse by 45% this year, with half of its businesses shuttered, grain exports mostly cut off by Russia's naval blockade and destruction rendering economic activity impossible in many areas.

The bank forecast Russia's GDP would contract by 11.2% this year due to punishing Western sanctions.

1345,US employs unusual intel strategy to counter Putin,"The White House has aggressively worked to rebut false narratives emanating from Russia about the crisis in Ukraine by proactively releasing intelligence information, a highly unusual strategy that experts and former officials say has knocked Russian President Vladimir Putin off his game.

The tactic didnâ€™t prevent Russia from invading Ukraine, but experts credit it with scrambling and defanging some of the Russian plots to create a false justification for an invasion, as well as preparing the world to react quickly.

â€œIt didnâ€™t deter them, but it disrupted what they were doing and I think short circuited some of their plans,â€ said Clint Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

President Biden credited this strategy in a speech from the White House on Thursday, making clear on the world stage that â€œPutin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war.â€

â€œWe have been transparent with the world â€” we shared declassified intelligence about Russiaâ€™s plans and cyber attacks and false pretexts â€” so that there can be no confusion or cover up,â€ he said.

VladimÃ­r BilÄÃ­k, head of the European Parliamentâ€™s Committee on Foreign Interference, told The Hill that the blunt and dire warnings from the U.S. took away Putinâ€™s ability to benefit from the element of surprise.

â€œThis transparency, this quick exposure and this intelligence sharing has been extremely useful because I think it has pointed to a number of weak points in Russiaâ€™s strategy. There has been little element of surprise in terms of whatâ€™s to come,â€ he said.

The decision by the U.S. to proactively share intelligence widely and publicly to rebut Russian narratives represented a shift and desire on the part of the administration to take a bolder approach than Obama administration officials in 2014, when Russia invaded Ukraineâ€™s Crimean Peninsula.

â€œWe were hampered by our cautiousness regarding our sharing of intelligence,â€ said Evelyn Farkas, who served as deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia under the Obama administration at the time of the 2014 invasion.

Still, the worst-case scenario came to pass on Wednesday night, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, carrying out attack plans earlier published by the U.K. Foreign Ministry of Defense that showed an extraordinary map with Putinâ€™s â€œpossible axis of invasion,â€ a phase one invasion from seven areas including Belarus, Russia and occupied Crimea.

â€œFor weeks, for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen. And now itâ€™s unfolding largely as we predicted,â€ Biden said on Thursday.

U.S. officials and experts say that while the publication of Putinâ€™s plans has failed to deter him, it has served to unite allies and partners to react in quick coordination and has primed domestic audiences to support imposing consequences.

This includes unity among the 27-nation bloc of the European Union, which convened two meetings in quick succession to discuss and vote on sanctions packages against Russia and Putin personally for invading Ukraine, as well as Moscowâ€™s recognition as independent territories in Ukraineâ€™s Donbas region.

Germany also moved quickly to suspend a Russia-to-Germany natural gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, a serious point of contention between Berlin and Washington and other countries in Europe.

â€œIâ€™m glad that Germany finally came around and, clearly stating, Nord Stream 2 is off the table,â€ BilÄÃ­k, who is from Slovakia and is a member of the Group of the European Peopleâ€™s Party (Christian Democrats). â€œThis is a project that cannot have a future at all.â€

A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found 67 percent of U.S. adults support sanctions on Russia, though Biden received negative marks overall for the way he has handled the crisis.

â€œThe right control of the narrative is important for setting the background against which governments will make decisions,â€ said Daniel Fried, who served as U.S. ambassador to Poland and is a distinguished fellow with the Atlantic Council. â€œSo, high marks to the Biden people, theyâ€™re all in. This is crisis mode, all the senior officials are all in on this. I donâ€™t think Putin expected that.â€

While the U.S. and its allies have been proactive in calling out Putinâ€™s falsehoods against Ukraine on the world stage, the Russian leader has focused on his domestic audience, airing grievances against the West to convince the Russian people of a need to invade Ukraine.

But protests inside Russia have emerged over the past 36 hours in some 54 cities. These demonstrations are a strong signal of outrage and pushback against Putin among the Russian public, given the Kremlinâ€™s crackdown on free speech.

At least 1,745 people were reportedly arrested.

â€œIf you actually get people turning out and they can be fairly assured that theyâ€™re going to be arrested â€¦ I think is an incredibly informative signal to other Russians watching, that there are a lot of people out there who share your discontent about the regime,â€ Andrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the transatlantic security program with the Center for a New American Security, said during a panel discussion. â€œSo this can turn into a cascade effect.â€

Still, itâ€™s unlikely to spur regime change in the near-term, given Putinâ€™s tight grip on power.

â€œI think the most analytically objective answer is, thereâ€™s little prospect for instability inside Russia,â€ she said.

Putinâ€™s control of Russian media hampers the ability of the U.S. and other countries to break through to Russian audiences, and the Kremlin has sought to further restrict outside information from other sources.

Russian officials on Friday took moves to restrict Facebook, in an action the social media company said was retaliation for countering disinformation and as a tool for activists to organize protests.

â€œOrdinary Russians are using [Meta Platform Incs.] apps to express themselves and organize for action. We want them to continue to make their voices heard, share whatâ€™s happening, and organize through Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger,â€ Nick Clegg, Facebook parent company Metaâ€™s vice president of global affairs, wrote on Twitter.

Countering Russian information operations, both covert and overt, will continue to challenge the Biden administration as it seeks to maintain unity among allies, partners and the global community in support of Ukraine.

Watts predicted that Russia would look to find sympathetic audiences in European countries, like supporters of far-right politicians in France and the U.K.

â€œI think the first wave of disinformation is done already and weâ€™re looking to see where they pivot next,â€ he said.

In the crosshairs is Russian state-backed media outlets like RT and Sputnik news. The State Departmentâ€™s bureau on identifying and combating disinformation campaigns, the Global Engagement Center, described those outlets in a January report as â€œcritical elements in Russiaâ€™s disinformation and propaganda ecosystem.â€

The British government on Thursday accused RT of being a tool of Kremlin disinformation and asked the UK media regulator to take â€œappropriate actionâ€ and review whether the channel is spreading disinformation, a spokesperson for the prime ministerâ€™s office told Reuters.

Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) said he was â€œpersonally struckâ€ by the scale of Russian state-backed media on airwaves and social media while on a trip to Europe this week. He raised it as a challenge to keep allies united against Kremlin-sponsored propaganda and disinformation.

â€œI was personally struck, as I was trying to get information about the first stages of the Russian invasion, how much my social media feed, while I was in eastern Europe, was just flooded with obviously Russian crap, of the most stunning quality, but intentionality. I do think that is a challenge,â€ he told The Hill.

But he added that Putinâ€™s brazen aggression against Ukraine and the efforts to call out Russian disinformation and the Kremlinâ€™s attack plans have bolstered unity over other political differences.

â€œI did not sense any significant disunity among the European leaders with whom we met,â€ Coons said. â€œIf anything, national leaders with whom we had issues that were causing tension or distance, we clearly were being brought together by the tension of this moment.â€",https://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/595916-us-employs-unusual-intel-strategy-to-counter-putin,Anti-Russian

Saturdayâ€™s racist mass shooting of 13 people in a Buffalo supermarket is a direct result of the poisonous belief in white supremacy.

Investigators believe the 18-year-old gunman was spurred by what is known as â€œthe great replacementâ€ rhetoric, the appalling conspiracy theory that purports that there is a concerted effort â€” often blamed on Jews â€” to replace and even extinguish white Americans with people of color through immigration, intermarriage and violence.

In October 2018, a white supremacist killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh; an online post was found in which he blamed Jews for bringing nonwhite immigrants and refugees to the United States. In August 2019, a white supremacist killed 23 people at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart; he referred to a â€œHispanic invasionâ€ and the â€œgreat replacement.â€

That twisted ideology is planting roots right here, so as much we want might want to, we cannot keep these tragedies at armâ€™s length.

There is a reason we keep urging Lancaster County residents to strongly reject racist and antisemitic hatred.

Replacement theory

The white supremacist group Patriot Front is recruiting here and across Pennsylvania, Walker reported in February.

Ethnic purity is a requirement for membership in that group. An interviewee must claim â€œat least 75% European ethnic lineage, and be born within America to qualify,â€ a leaked document published by the left-leaning nonprofit news outlet Unicorn Riot revealed.

As Walker reported, â€œUnicorn Riotâ€™s analysis of applicantâ€™s interview notes found that every member who was accepted â€” including Pennsylvania applicants â€” stated there was an â€˜ethnic componentâ€™ to being American and that â€˜nationhood cannot be bestowed to those not of the founding stock.â€™ â€

In order to protect that â€œfounding stock,â€ Patriot Front has taken part in anti-abortion marches â€” presumably to encourage the births of more white infants.

The groupâ€™s founder, Thomas Rousseau, said this in a speech at the University of Texas at Austin in 2017: â€œAmerica our nation stands before an existential threat. ... A corrupt, rootless, global and tyrannical elite has usurped your democracy and turned it into a weapon, first to enslave and then to replace you.â€

Itâ€™s utter nonsense, of course. But what happened in Buffalo is heartrending, terrible evidence that itâ€™s deadly nonsense.

As national media have pointed out, popular Fox News host Tucker Carlson frequently has pushed â€œthe great replacementâ€ rhetoric. So, too, have members of the Republican Party.

U.S. Rep. Scott Perry of York County said this in April 2021, according to the York Dispatch: â€œFor many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is, what appears to them is weâ€™re replacing national-born Americans, native-born Americans to permanently transform the landscape of this very nation.â€

That is replacement theory.

Some Republicans have spoken out against it. U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming put it plainly on Twitter on Monday: â€œThe House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse.â€

She is right. It starts with words, which are easily dismissed but must not be.

As Walker reported for LNP | LancasterOnline Sunday, the Anti-Defamation Leagueâ€™s â€œpyramid of hateâ€ model argues that as bias-motivated language increases, so will bias-motivated violence.

â€œIn the last few years, we see that people are more emboldened to talk about their hate,â€ said Andrew Goretsky, regional director for ADL Philadelphia. â€œI believe firmly one leads to the other.â€

We do, too. Which is why we believe that whatever its source, we must not let hateful language go unchallenged. Weâ€™re not talking about shutting down a personâ€™s First Amendment right to speech â€” weâ€™re talking about countering antisemitic and racist speech and conduct, even when itâ€™s uncomfortable to do so because itâ€™s coming from a friend, a co-worker, a neighbor or a relative.

Likewise, we must not dismiss or minimize the significance of what Walker has reported.

As he noted Sunday, â€œThe Anti-Defamation League recently released a report documenting more hateful propaganda in Pennsylvania in 2021 than any other state.â€

ADL assistant regional director Santos Ramos told Walker that the organization â€œfavors legislation first introduced by state Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Allegheny County, in 2019 that would increase penalties and extend protections to the LGBTQ community, enhance reporting of incidents in schools and require offenders to participate in community service or educational classes.â€

In the current legislative session, a version of that package is being sponsored by state Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Allegheny County. It includes a provision to create a hate group database that could be used by law enforcement.

The prospects for these state reforms are dim, which is a shame because an improved hate group database seems to us to be a critical need. As Walker reported, the current database, maintained by the Pennsylvania State Police, appears to be marred by reporting discrepancies.

Consequences for hatred

As Walker reported, hate crime convictions remain rare, even as hate crimes increase. Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams told Walker that obtaining a conviction requires sufficient evidence that the underlying crime was committed with malicious intent based on race, color, religion or national origin.

So letâ€™s take this seriously and speak out before crimes are committed. Letâ€™s make it difficult for hatemongers to feel at home in Lancaster County.

We have no qualms at all, for instance, about the fact that pro-Putin Holocaust denier Charles Bausman â€” who hosted a white supremacist gathering at his historic Lancaster Township barn in August 2020 â€” withdrew his name last week from a zoning appeal of an affordable housing development at 213 College Ave. in Lancaster city.

His withdrawal came after LNP | LancasterOnline asked the other six residents involved in the appeal about his inclusion.

As LNP | LancasterOnlineâ€™s Tom Lisi reported, Bausman owns a home on West Chestnut Street near the proposed College Avenue development site â€” though he still may be in Russia, where heâ€™s been living to avoid any legal repercussions of his illegal entrance into the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.

Bausman may be entitled as a Lancaster city homeowner to participate in a zoning appeal. But that doesnâ€™t mean he cannot be held accountable for his views, Kurt Braddock, a professor at American University who studies extremism and white supremacists, told Lisi.

â€œI think one of the ways that people can demonstrate their displeasure would be to refuse money from somebody like this,â€ Braddock said.

As Lisi reported, Bausman contributed money for legal expenses related to the zoning appeal. The remaining appellants ought to return that money â€” or, better, donate it to a Ukrainian charity or the Anti-Defamation League.

Because we agree with Braddock that there ought to be repercussions for antisemitism and racism.

715,5 things to know today about the Russia-Ukraine crisis,"President Biden on Friday said heâ€™s â€œconvincedâ€ Russian President Vladimir Putin has made up his mind to move forward with an invasion of Ukraine.

Russia has assembled forces outside the Ukrainian borders over the past few months, sparking concern amongst the international community that Moscow will invade the former Soviet country.

These fears were exacerbated on Saturday when the leaders of Russian-backed separatist territories signed mobilization decrees and called for able-bodied men to take up arms.

Here are five things to know as the situation along the Russian-Ukrainian border escalates:

Eastern Ukrainian front becomes increasingly volatile

Violence in eastern Ukraine has increased in recent days as the former Soviet country and two separatist-held regions accused each other of escalation. Russia on Saturday said at least two shells fired from eastern Ukraine landed across the border, but Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed that claim as a â€œfake statement,â€ according to The Associated Press.

The line separating Ukrainian forces from the Russian-backed rebels has been plagued by periodic violence in the last few years, but recent shelling attacks and bombings could set off an all-out war, the newswire noted.

According to Agence France Presse, the joint military command for eastern Ukraine said a soldier sustained a fatal shrapnel wound in the conflict zone.

Meanwhile, leaders of separatist territories in the Luhansk and Donetsk region on Saturday called for a mobilization of able-bodied males.

â€œI appeal to all the men in the republic who can hold weapons to defend their families, their children, wives, mothers,â€ Denis Pushilin, the head of the pro-Russia separatist government in Ukraineâ€™s Donetsk region, said, according to the AP. â€Together we will achieve the coveted victory that we all need.â€

Additionally, senior Ukrainian military officials were forced to take cover in a bomb shelter after a shelling attack near the separatist front.

Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst told The Hill that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky does not believe Russia will launch a full-scale invasion; instead, fighting will be limited to the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine.

â€œThe Ukrainian government thinks that if there is going to be a Russian escalation of its ongoing war in Ukraine, itâ€™s most likely to come in Donbas as opposed to something spectacular, like a drive to capture Kiev or any other major Ukrainian city,â€ he added.

The separatist-controlled areas in Donbas became known as the Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic (LPR) and the Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic (DPR) after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014.

U.S. touts a united front with its European allies

U.S. officials have continued to convey unity with its allies and their shared agreement on severe economic sanctions should Russia invade Ukraine.

Vice President Harris said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that U.S. support for the NATO alliance is â€œsacrosanct,â€ and pledged that Russia would face â€œunprecedentedâ€ economic penalties in the event of an invasion.

â€œOur strength must not be underestimated because after all it lies in our unity,â€ she said. â€œAnd as we have always shown it takes a lot more strength to build something up than it takes to tear something down.â€

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also made the trek to Munich where she underscored the gravity of sanctions that will be imposed against Russia should it overstep into Ukraine.

She added that an attack on Ukraine would be â€œan attack on democracy.â€

Similar statements were made by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who warned that any invasion would also be met with sanctions.

Specifically, Johnson said that the U.K. would make it impossible for certain Russian companies to raise capital in London, according to the BBC.

â€œIf Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world, and those echoes will be heard in East Asia, they will be heard in Taiwan,â€ he said.

Ukraine feels weight of world order on its shoulders

Leaders made it clear throughout the Munich conference that stability in Europe and the world is riding on Ukraineâ€™s ability to defend itself and remain an independent nation.

Zelensky himself made clear the pressure the country was facing during a short press appearance with Harris.

â€œThis is our land, we understand what is happening. The only thing we want is to return peace to our country, and in this situation, we are very grateful to you, the United States, as our ally and partner, we are grateful to President Biden,â€ Zelensky said at his meeting with Harris.

He added that Ukraineâ€™s army is â€œdefending all of Europe,â€ and told Harris that â€œthe only thing we want is to have peace.â€ He characterized Ukraine as Europeâ€™s â€œshieldâ€ against the Russian military, and called for more international support.

von der Leyen sounded an even graver tone, warning that potential Russian aggression threatens the international order.

She added that a potential Russian incursion in the coming days â€œcould reshape the entire international order.â€

Herbst, now senior director of the Atlantic Councilâ€™s Eurasia Center, added that any conflict could end the â€œmost peaceful, most stable, and most prosperous period in human history.â€

He also warned that â€œChina is watching the events unfold,â€ and a successful campaign by Putin could encourage the country to make moves of its own.

Russia continues to deny ill intentions

Russia, for its part, has denied accusations that it intends to invade Ukraine.

The U.S. earlier this week alleged that Moscow was responsible for cyberattacks on Ukraineâ€™s government and banks in an attempt to further destabilize the country.

However, Russia has pushed back against those claims and has blamed the U.S. for making â€œanti-Russianâ€ statements.

â€œWe paid attention to the frankly anti-Russian statements of the Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security E.Neiberger, who accused intelligence agencies of cyber attacks on ï¸ systems of the Ministry of Defense and a number of commercial banks,â€ the Russian Embassy in the U.S. said in a statement on Twitter.

â€œ[Russia] has nothing to do with the events mentioned and, in principle, has never carried out and does not conduct â€˜maliciousâ€™ operations in the virtual space,â€ the embassy wrote.

EU and U.S. rally to provide Ukraine with medical, financial support

The EU sent emergency medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from Kyiv amid an escalation of the crisis with Russia, the European Commission said on Saturday, according to a Reuters report.

France, Romania, Slovenia, Ireland and Austria have sent medical aid, the Commission said.

France has sent a field hospital, medicines and hundreds of tents, blankets, sleeping bags. Additional aid, including medical equipment and power generators, were deployed by the other EU countries, per the report. Reuters added that more help is expected in the coming days.

â€œFollowing a request from the Government of Ukraine for emergency assistance due to the threat of further escalation, the European Commission is coordinating the delivery of essential supplies to support the civilian population,â€ said an EU statement.",https://thehill.com/policy/international/europe/595055-state-of-play-five-things-to-know-today-about-the-russia-ukraine,Neutral
2879,"Russia widens attack on Ukraineâ€™s cities, striking western airfields and Dnipro","

CNN, POOL, UNTV, RADIO FREE EUROPE, RADIO LIBERTY, RUSSIA 24, UKRAINAN ARMED FORCES, FACEBOOK, VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, CNN, CNN, POOL, UNTV, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Russia 24, Ukrainan Armed Forces, Facebook/Volodymyr Zelensky

By Tim Lister, Gianluca Mezzofiore, Paul Murphy, Laura Smith-Spark and Rob Picheta, CNN

Russian forces launched multiple missile attacks on a wide range of targets across Ukraine in the early hours of Friday, striking airfields in the far west of the country and, for the first time, hitting the central city of Dnipro, to which Ukrainians from other embattled cities have fled.

The airport at Lutsk, some 70 miles from the Polish border, was reported to have suffered substantial damage in the attacks. The governor of Volyn region said four missiles had been fired from a Russian bomber and that two people were killed.

Plumes of smoke also rose from the military airfield at Ivano-Frankivsk, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Lutsk. It was previously struck by missiles on the first day of the conflict.

â€œOn the morning of March 11, high-precision long-range weapons attacked Ukraineâ€™s military infrastructure. The military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk were put out of action,â€ the Russian Defense Ministry said Friday.

Three Russian airstrikes also caused serious damage in and around the central city of Dnipro on Friday morning, killing one person, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in an official Telegram channel. One strike was near a preschool and an apartment building and another hit a shoe factory, causing a fire, the service said.

Many Ukrainians evacuated in recent days from other cities under Russian fire had been taken to the relative safety of Dnipro.

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said Friday it remains â€œgravely concerned by the rising death toll and human suffering in Ukraineâ€ and called â€œfor an immediate end to the attacks.â€

â€œCivilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas,â€ OHCHR spokeswoman Liz Throssell said in a statement.

OHCHR said it has so far recorded 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries since the invasion began on 24 February, â€œalthough the actual figure could be much higher.â€

â€œSchools, hospitals, and kindergartens have been hit â€” with hugely devastating consequences,â€ Throssell said. On March 3, 47 civilians were killed when Russian airstrikes hit two schools and several apartment blocks in Chernihiv and on March 9, a Russian airstrike hit a Mariupol hospital, injuring at least 17 civilians, she said.

â€œWe are still investigating reports that at least three civilians may have been killed in the airstrike,â€ she said. â€œWe spoke to different sources in Mariupol, including local authorities, indicating consistently that the hospital was both clearly identifiable and operational when it was hit.â€

Throssell also said OHCHR has received â€œcredible reports of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas.â€ The use of cluster munitions in populated areas is â€œincompatible with the international humanitarian law,â€ she said.

Elsewhere, in the southern city of Mykolaiv, heavy shelling erupted on Friday evening.

Social media videos showed fires in the area and Vitaliy Kim, Head of Mykolaiv Region Administration, said that there were â€œactive hostilities near Guryivka,â€ to the north of the city.

In a series of messages on his Telegram channel, Kim said the bombardment amounted to â€œindiscriminate shooting at civilian targets,â€ including a cafe and apartment block.

And in the southeastern city of Melitopol, Mayor Ivan Fedorov was seen on video being led away by armed men from a government building on Friday.

The prosecutorâ€™s office for the separatist, Russian-backed Luhansk region now says they are weighing terrorism charges against him. Fedorovâ€™s detention by the armed men is the first known instance of a Ukrainian political official being detained and investigated by Russian, or Russian-backed forces, since the invasion began.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry published a strongly worded statement on Facebook, calling Fedorovâ€™s detention an â€œabductionâ€ and a â€œwar crime.â€

Meanwhile the number of people who have fled Ukraine continues to rise.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said Friday that the number of people who have left the country has now hit 2.5 million.

Many others are still trapped in dire conditions as Russian forces bombard multiple cities. Ukrainian authorities said there was limited success Friday in securing the evacuation of civilians from areas worst affected by the fighting.

Resistance persists

In eastern Ukraine, there is growing evidence that the town of Volnovakha, has finally fallen to Russian forces and their allies in the so-called Donetsk Peopleâ€™s Republic. The city had been surrounded almost since the beginning of Russiaâ€™s invasion but had been fiercely defended by Ukrainian forces.

Some social media videos from the city showed Russian soldiers and vehicles in several neighborhoods, as well as abandoned Ukrainian tanks. Other videos showed widespread destruction in Volnovakha, and the Russian defense ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, claimed the town had been taken.

Russia has made some additional advances around the rest of the country in the past 24 hours, a senior US defense official told reporters on Friday.

But the French government painted a less than rosy picture of the Russian militaryâ€™s progress.

The Russian army was poorly prepared for its invasion of Ukraine and is now facing many difficulties on the ground, â€œparticularly in the logistical field and in the field of intelligence,â€ French armed forces spokesperson Pascal Ianni told TV station France2 on Friday.

â€œIt is possible that an attack on Kyiv will be carried out in the next few days, but actually taking control of Kyiv is a whole other matter and will take a long, long time,â€ he said. â€œThe Russian army is also caught up in a premature spring,â€ he added, with the defrosting ground causing mobility difficulties for the military.

Britainâ€™s Ministry of Defence said on Friday that Russian forces continued to make â€œlimited progressâ€ in advancing toward Kyiv â€” but could be preparing for a fresh attack against the Ukrainian capital in the coming days.

â€œIt remains highly unlikely that Russia has successfully achieved the objectives outlined in its pre-invasion plan,â€ the ministry said in an intelligence update. â€œLogistical issues that have hampered the Russian advance persist, as does strong Ukrainian resistance.â€

Fighting intensified to the northeast and east of the capital Friday, after the Ukrainians successfully intercepted and attacked an advancing Russian tank column on Thursday.

An overnight airstrike on the Brovary district just east of the capital caused no casualties, according to Kyiv authorities. Ukrainian authorities also reported a missile strike on the town of Baryshivka overnight into Friday, some 45 miles east of the city.

A Russian column that had been stalled for nearly two weeks outside Kyiv has now dispersed, according to Maxar satellite imagery from Thursday. The forces appear to be regrouping.

And a western defense official confirmed on Friday that a third Russian general had been killed by Ukrainian forces. He was named as Major General Andriy Kolesnikov, and was commander of the Eastern Military District, according to the Russian defense ministry website. The official noted for context that three Russian general staff officers were killed during the whole Syrian conflict.

In Moscow, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that the invasion was being carried out successfully, despite claims from Western leaders that its military has encountered unplanned obstacles and resistance.

â€œAll is going according to the plan, we report to you here every day this week,â€ Shoigu told Russian President Vladimir Putin at a televised meeting of the countryâ€™s security council.

Shoigu claimed that the Russian army has received more than 16,000 applications from volunteers in the Middle East wanting to join the war in Ukraine. He also asked Putin for more weapons to arm the separatist regions of eastern Ukraineâ€™s Donbas region, including arms that Shoigu claimed the Russian army had seized from the Ukrainians.

Putin supported both suggestions.

5198,Moskva sinking: What really happened to the pride of Russia's fleet?,"The Russian guided-missile cruiser Moskva rests deep beneath the Black Sea this morning.

Whether it lies there as the victim of Ukrainian missiles, Russian incompetence, bad luck or a combination of all three is unclear. What is certain, though, is that the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years will raise troubling questions not only for Moscow, but for military planners around the world.

What caused the sinking?

The ship sank off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea on Thursday.

Russia's Defense Ministry says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ship's stored ammunition and the resulting explosions left the Moskva with structural damage. It says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port.

Ukraine says it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles and that these sparked the fire that detonated the ammunition.

U.S. and Western defense officials seem to favor the Ukrainian account.

The U.S. believes with ""medium confidence"" that Ukraine's version of events is accurate, a source familiar with the latest intelligence told CNN.

The Moskva was armed with a range of anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles as well as torpedoes, naval guns and missile defense systems, meaning it would have had massive amounts of explosives aboard.

When was the last time a ship of this size was lost in war?

The Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was torpedoed and sunk by the British nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror on May 2, 1982, during the Falkland Islands war.

The General Belgrano and the Moskva were of similar size â€” each about 600 feet (182 meters) long and displacing 12,000 tons â€” though the crew of about 1,100 aboard the General Belgrano was more than double the size of the Moskva's crew of about 500.

Russia has not disclosed the number of casualties occurred during the Moskva's fire and subsequent sinking. A total of 323 crew died when the General Belgrano went down.

What does the loss of the Moskva mean for the Russian war effort?

The biggest effect may be on Russian morale. As the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva was one of its most visible assets in the Ukraine war. Though Moscow carefully manages news about the war in Russia, it will be hard to hide the sudden absence of such a large ship.

And its loss will raise doubts about Russia's warfighting abilities, whether it was due to enemy action or accident.

""Both explanations for the sinking of the Moskva indicate possible Russian deficiencies â€” either poor air defenses or incredibly lax safety procedures and damage control on the Black Sea Fleet's flagship,"" analysts Mason Clark, Kateryna Stepanenko, and George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War wrote in their daily war briefing.

Carl Schuster, a former U.S. Navy captain, said the doubts went all the way to the Kremlin.

""It raises questions about naval competence 10 years after (Russian President Vladimir) Putin announced he was going to restore the navy's capabilities, morale and professionalism,"" Schuster said.

""It seems he has not been able to keep any of his promises for any of Russia's military services,"" Schuster said, noting Russia had suffered setbacks on land too.

But analysts are split on what impact the sinking will have on the Russian invasion.

The ISW analysts see it as a relatively minor blow, saying the ship was mostly used for cruise missile strikes on Ukrainian logistic centers and airfields. Russia has land-based systems and strike aircraft that can do the same thing, they said.

However, they added that if it was indeed a Ukrainian missile that led to the sinking, the Russian navy would have to rethink its operations, possibly moving ships farther from Ukrainian territory and adjusting their air defenses.

In Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Moskva's main mission was air defense for the Russian forces in the Black Sea.

""It will have an impact on that capability, certainly in the near term,"" Kirby told reporters.

A lesson for China?

Analysts say the sinking will be carefully studied in East Asia, especially if it is confirmed that Ukrainian missiles struck the warship.

In particular, analysts will be searching for any insight it might offer into any potential military conflict involving Taiwan â€” the democratically ruled island that Beijing's ruling Communist Party claims as part of its territory. Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to gain control of Taiwan and this has caused tensions with the US, which is committed to providing the island with defensive weapons.

Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corp. think tank, said the strike on the Moskva would underscore to both China and the U.S. ""the vulnerability of surface ships"" in any potential military clash.

Heath said in such a scenario the U.S. Navy would want to keep its surface ships well out of range of the anti-ship missiles Beijing has amassed on the Chinese mainland.

China, on the other hand, would be aware that Taiwan had been acquiring inexpensive anti-ship missiles similar to those Ukraine claims hit the Moskva, Heath and others said.

Because of that, ""any potential (Chinese) invasion of Taiwan remains an extremely high risk mission,"" Heath said.

But some analysts said the Moskva's sinking has limited relevance for the situation in East Asia.

Thomas Shugart, a former U.S. Navy submarine commander who is now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, said there were too many differences between the situations.

The Moskva's air defense systems are not in the same league as the more modern Aegis systems on U.S. Navy destroyers, and Ukrainian anti-ship missiles are not as good as Chinese ones, Shugart said.

And Soviet-era warships like the Moskva have been typically ""known for their offensive punch, not for their defensive systems or their damage control,"" Shugart said.

MOSCOW (AP) â€” Ivan Malyuta, a resident of Donetsk, a city in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, applied for Russian citizenship this month and said he, his wife and three children will soon be getting Russian passports.

â€œI want to be a citizen of the Russian Federation. We are moving towards this, arenâ€™t we?â€ he said at a Donetsk migration service office.

Malyuta and his family will join more than 720,000 residents of rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine who have received Russian citizenship and passports in a fast-track procedure widely seen as an attempt to underscore Russiaâ€™s influence in the region.

Russia threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine in 2014, shortly after annexing Crimea in response to a popular uprising in Kyiv ousting a Kremlin-friendly president.

Moscow has denied deploying troops or weapons to the rebel-held areas, with government officials repeatedly stressing that Russia is not a party to the conflict, which has killed over 14,000 people.

Besides the quick path to citizenship, Russia has offered residents of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics membership in the Kremlinâ€™s ruling party and other perks, such as its COVID-19 vaccines or trade preferences for local manufacturers.

Ukraine has been appalled by the efforts amid rising tensions and fears of a new invasion. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the European Union last week to impose sanctions on Russia for â€œits illegal mass issuing of Russian passports to Ukrainian citizens.â€

On Tuesday, Russian lawmakers appealed to President Vladimir Putin to recognize the independence of the two self-proclaimed republics, eliciting even more outrage in Kyiv, with both the Foreign Ministry and parliament releasing statements condemning the move.

Putin hasnâ€™t said how he will act on the request, but signaled he wasnâ€™t inclined to support the idea, which would violate a 2015 agreement about their status.

Political analysts agree the Kremlin is unlikely to back independence for Donetsk and Luhansk any time soon, but will continue to reap political benefits from its involvement in eastern Ukraine.

â€œItâ€™s a form of keeping the pressure on Kyiv, destabilizing it and hindering Ukraineâ€™s movement towards European values, towards NATO,â€ said Moscow-based political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin.

Putin signed a decree simplifying the procedure for obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of Donetsk and Luhansk in April 2019 â€“ the day after Volodymyr Zelenskyyâ€™s presidential victory was officially proclaimed.

Since then, more than 720,000 residents of the rebel-held areas â€“ about 18% of the population â€“ have received Russian passports.

Olga Matvienko, an official of the migration service in Donetsk, told The Associated Press the number of people applying for Russian passports has increased in recent weeks as tensions around Ukraine soared. She said the procedure has been â€œextremely simplified,â€ and takes just one to three months.

Donetsk residents who have applied say having Russian citizenship gives them a sense of protection from a powerful neighboring state.

â€œRelatives (in Russia) tell us that Putin wonâ€™t abandon us and everything will be fine,â€ said 62-year-old retiree Nelya Dzyuba.

Many also say it will allow them to travel to Russia and enjoy benefits Russian citizens are entitled to, such as free health care. For that, however, a passport holder must go through additional red tape, though Putin last month tasked the government with making access to benefits easier.

Ukrainian officials have charged that handing Russian passports to residents of the rebel-held areas violates a 2015 peace deal for eastern Ukraine brokered by France and Germany, a claim Moscow denies.

The deal, widely known as the Minsk agreements, put a stop to large-scale hostilities, but failed to bring about a political settlement of the conflict. It envisioned Donetsk and Luhansk as part of Ukraine, but with broad autonomy from Kyiv, which has said that implementing the agreements would hurt Ukraine. The Kremlin, on the other hand, has insisted the Minsk deal is the only way to settle the conflict, and has repeatedly accused Ukraine of sabotaging its implementation.

Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said last week that issuing Russian passports to residents of rebel-held areas on a mass scale violates the Minsk agreements.

In an interview with the AP, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraineâ€™s National Security and Defense Council, echoed his sentiment. â€œThey have issued a crazy amount of Russian passports,â€ he said, adding that â€œtheyâ€™re involving these people in their political structure.â€

Donetsk and Luhansk residents with Russian passports were allowed to vote in last yearâ€™s Russian parliamentary elections and in the 2020 plebiscite on constitutional reform that permits Putin to run for two additional terms. They were bussed into the neighboring Rostov region in Russia to cast their ballots.

In December, the Kremlinâ€™s ruling United Russia party also accepted top officials of the self-proclaimed governments in Donetsk and Luhansk into its ranks, along with some 200 ordinary residents of the rebel-held areas.

Analyst Oreshkin also noted the political benefit to the Kremlin, saying it could potentially lead to â€œalmost a million additional votes for Vladimir Putinâ€ and his United Russia party.

Amid warnings that Russia might invade Ukraine, some fear that Moscow might use the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens in Donbas as a pretext for military action to defend them.

Russian officials have repeatedly accused Kyiv of plans to retake the rebel-held areas by force and have promised to respond if that happens. Commenting on the lawmakersâ€™ appeal to Putin to recognize the self-proclaimed republics, State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said Tuesday that â€œour citizens and compatriots living in Donbas are in need of help and support.â€

Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military expert at the Kyiv-based Razumkov Center think tank, said that Russia â€œcould use defending the interests of Russian citizens in Donetsk and Luhansk as pretext ... for starting the war.â€

Sunhurovskyi noted that Russia used a similar pretext in 2008 during its war with Georgia after handing out Russian passports to residents of the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

Analyst Oreshkin said, however, that the Kremlin is much more interested in keeping the status of the rebel-held areas in limbo and showing that it has a number of options on the table â€” be it recognizing their independence or deploying forces to protect Russian citizens there.

â€œThere is no political interest so far. Rather, there is political interest in scaremongering, both in Ukraine and its NATO neighbors, with such a rhetoric,â€ Oreshkin said.

10768,Putin could be charged with the crime of aggression for the Ukraine war â€“ but itâ€™s an expensive process with high stakes,"A 21-year-old Russian soldier pleaded guilty in a trial in Kyiv on May 18, 2022, for shooting a Ukrainian man in the head after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February 2022.

It marked the first trial of a Russian soldier for the war in Ukraine, as allegations mount of Russia committing war crimes â€“ a broad category under international law that includes targeting civilians during conflict.

Ukraine is investigating more than 10,700 potential war crimes, involving more than 600 Russian soldiers and government officials.

But there is a large gap between trying an individual sergeant for war crimes and holding Russian leaders themselves accountable for crimes committed during the war.

A lesser-known international crime, called the crime of aggression, could provide a pathway for prosecuting Russian President Vladimir Putin. This crime punishes the illegal invasion or use of force against another country. Only the leaders of the country that started a war can be held responsible for this crime.

Philippe Sands, a well-known international legal expert, has called a crime of aggression case against Putin â€œa slam dunk.â€. This is because there is no legal justification for Russia invading Ukraine.

But this legal option is complicated and would likely require forming a new international tribunal â€“ a court set up to specifically investigate and charge people for violating international law.

And as an international lawyer, I know the biggest challenge to holding Putin accountable is not legal, but political. Setting up a special court would require a large political commitment by countries across the globe to follow through on the charges â€“ and it would require a lot of money.

Understanding crimes of aggression

The crime of aggression, formally known as â€œcrimes against the peace,â€ is generally defined as waging an aggressive war without legal justification.

This crime was first prosecuted at the post-World War II Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals, which were established temporarily between 1945 and 1948. Thirty-one German and Japanese political and military leaders were convicted of these crimes, including Nazi Deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess.

There is little question among international lawyers that Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine is an ongoing crime of aggression.

Itâ€™s an easier charge than other war-related crimes to level at a national leader. Charging Putin with war crimes would require substantial evidence â€“ like witness testimony or intercepted communications â€“ to prove that Putin planned, directed, knew of or should have known of specific attacks against civilians.

The crime of aggression, on the other hand, is intended for heads of states like Putin and their inner circle. Legal experts have drafted a model indictment against Putin. Many legal observers believe that there would be enough evidence to find Putin guilty of this crime and imprison him.

Not a panacea

Since the 1940s convictions, no one has been prosecuted internationally for crimes of aggression. One reason is that the International Criminal Court â€“ an independent international court based in the Hague, Netherlands, that investigates genocide and war crimes â€“ was not established until 2002. Before then, there was no clear place to prosecute this crime.

International lawyers also did not agree on an exact definition of crimes of aggression for the court until 2010.

Russia has not joined the court. This means the court does not have legal power to independently prosecute Putinâ€™s invasion of Ukraine.

The United Nations Security Council could also refer this case to the court. But as a permanent member of the Security Council with veto powers, Russia would block any attempted referral.

Given the limits of the International Criminal Court in this case, a number of legal experts are discussing other pathways.

A new court

Most international experts say that the best option is a new international tribunal, separate from the International Criminal Court. Such tribunals are often set up with a narrow focus of war crimes from a particular conflict or atrocity. They are usually established through the United Nations.

That is because trials in national courts in Ukraine or another country â€“ which recognizes the crime of aggression in their national laws â€“ face various legal and political barriers.

Some experts also say that a domestic court lacks the legitimacy of an international trial.

Another option is a hybrid â€“ both international and national court â€“ stemming from an agreement between the U.N. and a country. But legal restrictions in Ukrainian law, for example, make this difficult because the countryâ€™s constitution has specific language that could block a hybrid or special court.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a human rights organization that has 47 European countries as members, has called for a new international criminal tribunal, which would be based in Strasbourg, France, and would investigate and prosecute Russian leaders for crimes of aggression. The temporary tribunal would have the power to issue an alert to police worldwide to arrest Putin or other Russian leaders whom prosecutors are charging with crimes.

Establishing a new court, though, would take time and a large amount of money. While there are big differences in the various costs of international or hybrid tribunals, prior court processes have cost between $10 million to $15 million per defendant.

International and hybrid courts, such as those that were set up to address conflict in Sierra Leone, are usually funded by wealthy countries like the United States and the United Kingdom.

No end in sight

As the Ukraine war and reports of war crimes continue to unfold, some experts warn against placing too much emphasis on any one kind of legal process for prosecuting Putin.

Ultimately, the barriers to arresting Putin in a foreign country and getting him into any foreign courtroom remain high. Putin is unlikely to leave Russia and risk arrest, and his tight control over Russia at this point also makes it unlikely that he would be turned in by Russian police.

Although it is possible to hold a trial without a defendant present, many human rights experts strongly object to this practice.

And one of the most substantial critiques of establishing a special tribunal for Russiaâ€™s aggression is the challenge of selectivity â€“ why this situation gets investigated and prosecuted internationally and why others, such as the U.S. invasion of Iraq, do not. But this is not a new challenge for international law and justice.

Once set up, an independent tribunal is beyond the political control of the countries that establish it.

To date, no head of a state whose country is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council has been tried for the crime of aggression. This would open an important new chapter in modern international justice that would follow a complicated, uncertain course.",https://theconversation.com/putin-could-be-charged-with-the-crime-of-aggression-for-the-ukraine-war-but-its-an-expensive-process-with-high-stakes-181928,Neutral

Putin sanctions reflect 'absolute impotence' of West: Russia

The imposition of sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reflect the West's ""absolute impotence"" when it comes to foreign policy, RIA news agency cited a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman as saying on Friday.

Maria Zakharova spoke before US President Joe Biden announced sanctions against the two men. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had earlier announced similar punitive measures.

01:01AM



US to impose sanctions on Putin, Lavrov

The White House on Friday said the United States would impose sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as Washington looks to ramp up pressure on Moscow following Russia's attack on Ukraine.

The rare but not unprecedented US move to impose sanctions on a head of state would come just a day after Russian forces attacked Ukraine, assaulting by land, sea and air in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the decision to target Putin, Lavrov and other officials was made after US President Joe Biden had a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

12:56AM



US dismisses Russia's offer of Ukraine talks

The United States on Friday dismissed Russia's offer of talks with Ukraine, and called on Moscow to show its commitment to diplomacy by withdrawing troops from the country.

After attacking Ukraine, ""now we see Moscow suggesting diplomacy take place at the barrel of a gun. This is not real diplomacy,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said.

UN Security Council vote delayed

A UN Security Council vote on a draft resolution that would condemn Moscowâ€™s invasion of Ukraine has been delayed by one hour until 4pm EST on Friday (1am Saturday UAE), diplomats said.

It was not immediately clear why the vote had been delayed.

Diplomats said on Thursday it appeared at least 11 of the 15 member council would vote in favor, while it was unclear how China, India and the United Arab Emirates would vote. Russia is expected to veto the measure.

11:47PM



Cyber criminals seek to take advantage of Ukraine chaos

Cybersecurity firm Avast Plc on Friday warned of cyber criminals seeking to take advantage of the chaos surrounding Russiaâ€™s attack on Ukraine to make quick money, terming it a threat.

â€œWe have tracked in the last 48 hours a number of scammers who are tricking people out of money by pretending they are Ukrainians in desperate need of financial help,â€ the company said in a mail to Reuters.

The London-listed company also said it was halting its services in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which it described as â€œnewly embargoed territories.â€ Avast said it was suspending its services to current users and withdrawing their availability to new users in the two territories.

Some of the 30 NATO allies announced the type of weapons that they would supply Ukraine, including air defences, he said, without giving details. ""Allies are very committed to continue to provide support,"" he said.

11:39PM



Russia limits Facebook access

Russia said on Friday it was partially limiting access to Meta Platforms Incâ€™s Facebook, accusing it of â€œcensoringâ€ Russian media, the latest in a series of steps against US social media giants and announced a day after Russia attacked Ukraine.

Moscow has been trying to exert tighter control over the internet and big tech for years, something critics say threatens individual and corporate freedom, and is part of a wider crackdown against outspoken opponents of the Kremlin.

The state communications regulator said Facebook had ignored its demands to lift restrictions on four Russian media outlets on its platform - RIA news agency, the Defence Ministryâ€™s Zvezda TV, and websites gazeta.ru and lenta.ru.

Metaâ€™s head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said in a statement on Twitter: â€œYesterday, Russian authorities ordered us to stop the independent fact-checking and labeling of content posted to Facebook by four Russian state-owned media organizations. We refused. As a result, they have announced they will be restricting the use of our services.â€

06:58PM



Guards fire shots as Ukrainians try to cram onto evacuation trains

Ukrainian guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyiv's central railway station on Friday as thousands of people tried to force their way onto evacuation trains.

Crowds were so large that not everyone could get on the trains from the capital to the western city of Lviv as fears of a Russian assault on Kyiv mounted.

When a train drew up at a platform, people rushed to the doors, hoping to get on board, some of them with their children and pets. The guards fired several shots with blanks to disperse the crowd after screams broke out.

06:14PM



Russia claims it controls airport near Kyiv

The Russian military claims it has taken control of an airport just outside Kyiv, as Kremlin forces bear down on the Ukrainian capital.

The claim could not be independently verified.

Taking possession of the airport in Hostomel, which has a long runway allowing the landing of heavy-lift transport planes, would mean Russia can airlift troops directly to Kyiv's outskirts.

Hostomel is just 7 kilometers northwest of the city.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Friday that the Russian airborne forces used 200 helicopters to land in Hostomel and killed over 200 troops belonging to Ukraine's special forces.

Konashenkov claimed that Russian troops suffered no casualties. That contradicts Ukrainian claims that Russian troops sustained heavy casualties in the fighting there.

Ukraine soldiers battle Russian troops in Kyiv

Ukrainian forces fought off Russian troops in the streets of the capital Kyiv on Friday as President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of targeting civilians and called for more international sanctions.

Pre-dawn blasts in Kyiv set off a second day of violence after Russian President Vladimir Putin defied Western warnings to unleash a full-scale attack on Thursday that quickly claimed dozens of lives and displaced at least 100,000 people.

The United States and its allies responded with a barrage of sanctions, but the Russian forces looked to press home their advantage after a string of key strategic victories in their air and ground assault.

As Russian forces closed in on the city, Zelensky called on Europeans with ""combat experience"" to take arms and defend Ukraine, saying the West was too slow to help his country.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow wanted to ""free Ukraine from oppression"" and denied there had been any strikes on civilian targets.

He said Moscow was ready to talk if Ukraine's armed forces ""lay down their arms"", adding that ""nobody intends to occupy Ukraine"".

05:16PM



EU to freeze assets of Putin, Lavrov

EU diplomats approved a plan to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over the attack of Ukraine, a largely symbolic step that would freeze their overseas assets, according to two senior officials.

The asset freeze, which would come in addition to a broader package of sanctions that the EU approved early Friday, doesnâ€™t affect the ability of Putin or Lavrov to travel, the officials said, as the EU seeks to keep diplomatic avenues open. Officially, Putin has very few assets, making his wealth something of a mystery.

04:49PM



Moscow may agree to talks

Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin is reportedly open to sending a delegation to Minsk for talks with Ukraine. Earlier, Chinaâ€™s leader Xi Jinping told Putin that Moscowâ€™s should negotiate with the government in Kyiv. Moscow-led forces continued attacks on military and civilian targets on the second day of their attack after the US and its allies imposed new sanctions on Moscow and US President Joe Biden warned of â€œa dangerous moment for all of Europe.â€

04:29PM



Missiles hit Kyiv as Ukraine capital girds for Russian assault

Missiles pounded Kyiv on Friday and families cowered in bomb shelters as Russian forces pressed their advance and authorities said they were girding for an assault aimed at overthrowing the government.

Air raid sirens wailed over the capital of three million people, where some residents sheltered in underground metro stations, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an attack that has shocked the world.

Ukrainian officials said a Russian aircraft had been shot down and crashed into a building in Kyiv overnight, setting it ablaze and injuring eight people.

A senior Ukrainian official said Russian forces would enter areas just outside the capital later on Friday and that Ukrainian troops were defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered.

The Kyiv city council warned residents of the city's Obolon district, near Hostomel, to stay indoors because of ""the approach of active hostilities"".

02:52PM



Russia ready to talk if Ukraine army 'lays down arms': Lavrov

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday that Moscow was ready for talks with Kyiv if the Ukrainian army surrendered, as Russian forces advanced on the capital.

""We are ready for negotiations at any moment, as soon as the armed forces of Ukraine respond to our call and lay down their arms,"" Lavrov said at a press conference in Moscow.

02:25PM



Russian forces approaching Kyiv: Ukraine army

Russian forces are approaching Kyiv from the north and northeast, Ukraine's army said on Friday, with rising fears the capital could fall on the second day of Moscow's offensive.

The soldiers are trying to ""bypass"" the northern city of Chernigiv - where they were ""rebuffed"" - to attack Kyiv, the Ukrainian army said on Facebook.

They were also advancing on Kyiv from the eastern city of Konotop, which is under Russian control, Kyiv's army said.

The Ukrainian army earlier said Russian ground forces had been pushing down the west bank of the Dnieper River from Belarus.

It said Russian soldiers were ""increasingly choosing to target civilian infrastructure and residential buildings"", echoing President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Nuclear agency finds Chernobyl radiation rise

Ukraineâ€™s nuclear energy regulatory agency says that higher than usual gamma radiation levels have been detected in the area near the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, after it was seized by the Russian military.

The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate said on Friday that higher gamma radiation levels have been detected in the Chernobyl zone, but didnâ€™t provide details of the increase.

It attributed the rise to a â€œdisturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the air.â€

12:52PM



Russia closes its airspace to British airlines

Russia has banned British airlines from landing at its airports or crossing its airspace, its state civil aviation regulator said on Friday. The move follows London's ban on the flights of Russian flag carrier Aeroflot imposed in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine.

Ukrainian military battles Russian forces

The Ukrainian military is reporting significant fighting northwest of the nation's capital as Russian forces apparently try to advance on Kyiv from the north.

The military said on Friday morning a bridge across a river had been destroyed in the area of Ivankiv, about 60 kilometres northwest of Kyiv.

""The hardest day will be today. The enemy's plan is to break through with tank columns from the side of Ivankiv and Chernihiv to Kyiv. Russian tanks burn perfectly when hit by our ATGMs (anti-tank guided missiles),'' Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram.

Zelensky says Russian actions show sanctions not enough

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday that continued Russian aggression against his country showed that sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West were not enough.

Zelensky said the world was continuing to observe what was going on in Ukraine after its capital Kyiv and other parts of the country were struck by Russian missiles in the early hours of Friday.

""To all the citizens of the Russian Federation who went out to protest, I want to say: we see you. This means you heard us.

This means you are starting to believe us. Fight for us, fight against the war."" Hundreds were detained across Russian cities on Thursday after taking part in protests after Moscow launched a massive military operation against Ukraine.

ICC says may investigate possible war crimes after Russian attack on Ukraine

International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan on Friday expressed his concern over the Russian attack of Ukraine and said his court may investigate possible war crimes in the country.

""I have been closely following recent developments in and around Ukraine with increasing concern,"" Khan said in a statement.

""I remind all sides conducting hostilities on the territory of Ukraine that my office may exercise its jurisdiction and investigate any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime committed within Ukraine.""

Following the Russian annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the subsequent fighting in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian government forces, Ukraine accepted ICC jurisdiction for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed on its territory since February 2014.

France 'accelerating' troop deployment to Romania

France was speeding up its deployment of troops to bolster NATO's eastern flank in Romania after Russia's attack of Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday.

Talking after an emergency summit with European Union leaders, Macron said he was ""accelerating"" the dispatch of forces. It is part of a broader push by NATO allies to reinforce their strength in the eastern members, with thousands of troops mobilised.

Meanwhile, the United States said on Thursday it was sending another 7,000 troops to Germany. NATO is looking to establish battle groups in the southeast of the alliance, including in Romania. France has offered to lead the new deployment in that country.

7300,How Ukraine was betrayed in Budapest,"Vladimir Putin made the Budapest Memorandum a dead letter with his first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. But the betrayal of Budapest isnâ€™t forgotten in Kyiv, as President Volodymyr Zelensky noted bitterly in weekend remarks in Munich.

Budapest shows again the folly of trusting parchment promises in a world where autocrats think might makes right. More damaging is the message that nations give up their nuclear arsenals at their peril. Thatâ€™s the lesson North Korea has learned, and Iran is following the same playbook as it connives to build the bomb even as it promises not to do so.

The inability of the U.S. to enforce its Budapest commitments will also echo in allied capitals that rely on Americaâ€™s military assurances. Donâ€™t be surprised if Japan or South Korea seek their own nuclear deterrent. If Americans want to know why they should care about Ukraine, nuclear proliferation is one reason.

3894,My Visit to the Border of Hell and Hope,"Standing in the back of the overcrowded conference room, I had a moment of disorientation. All around me stood Federation executives and lay leaders from the largest American cities. We were arrayed in a circle with some of us sitting in chairs while others, like myself, standing behind them. In the center of the room were bottles of water and juice placed eloquently on a small conference table while a flip chart with sticky notes was thrown into a corner. This scene is one that could have taken place at any hotel in the world. Except we werenâ€™t packed in together discussing new models of Jewish engagement or funding models of Jewish education. We came to Novatel Hotel in Warsaw, Poland, to listen and discuss the unfolding disaster in Ukraine, to meet with our global partners and assess next steps for the critical funding that propels our Jewish response to this humanitarian crisis.

At one end of the circle sat several Ukrainian refugees, exhausted and crestfallen, who came to the hotel because they wanted to immigrate to Israel.

At one end of the circle sat several Ukrainian refugees, exhausted and crestfallen, who came to the hotel because they wanted to immigrate to Israel. Among those seated was a young mother named â€œAnnaâ€ who related to us how she and her two children, a six-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl, made the treacherous journey from their home in Ukraine to Warsaw. She began her story by relating that on March 4, when the Russian army shelled the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, her husband told her, â€œYou have 15 minutes, take what you can and go. Just save our children and go!â€ She quickly gathered lifeâ€™s most vital documents, a change of clothes and some jewelry and shoved them into a single bag. Arriving at the local train station, she found it overrun with families just like hers, saying goodbye to husbands, fathers and brothers as they waited for a train â€” any train â€” as long as it headed west. Anna and her children were finally hoarded with fourteen other passengers into a compartment designed for four. â€œThe train moved slowly,â€ she said, stuffed with women, children the elderly and the frail. Anna said that her compartment had seven women and 11 children. They took turns sitting and standing for 22 hours on the slow-moving behemoth before it finally lumbered into Liviv. â€œNo one slept,â€ she said, â€œand almost no one spoke.â€

Annaâ€™s journey is not unique in Ukraine. The Russian invasion carries with it a strategic brutality that purposely targets schools and hospitals, turning mothers and children into targets in an attempt to terrorize the population into capitulation.

Annaâ€™s journey is not unique in Ukraine. The Russian invasion carries with it a strategic brutality that purposely targets schools and hospitals, turning mothers and children into targets in an attempt to terrorize the population into capitulation. While most of the men stay behind, conscripted to fight for their country, there are now more than three million refugees on the move, filling trains, cars, even large commercial vehicles mostly heading west and north to Poland, Romania, and Moldova. Nearly everywhere, the same scene played itself out. Young children, huddled together playing, their older siblings losing themselves in their phones while mothers sit quietly exhausted, staring into the distance.

In the freezing night they stood by the thousands, without shelter, services or certainty.

After arriving in Liviv, Anna said she transferred to a bus that ferried her to the Polish border. Now into her second day of her journey, she along with her children were made to wait in line, with thousands of others. â€œI could not see where the line finished, and it never seemed to move,â€ she added. For over 12 hours, she stood in the last gasp of Ukrainian winter, holding her young daughter in her arms until they both went numb. Her son, held close by holding on to the strap of her backpack, eventually fainted from exhaustion. In the freezing night they stood by the thousands, without shelter, services or certainty.

It wasnâ€™t until the next morning, as the international rescue teams began arriving, that they received any help. A car, driving up and down the road picking up refugees, saw Anna and her children. Eventually she crossed the border and took a bus to Warsaw, arriving at the central bus station. One of the aid workers found out that she was Jewish and said, â€œYou have to go to the Novatel,â€ which is where they are helping Jews.

The Jewish Agency For Israel, or JAFI, had taken over the entire building of the Novatelâ€”every hotel room, conference room, ballroom, the parking lot, the restaurant and even parts of the lobby, transforming them into a refugee center, consulate, logistics hub and motor pool.

The Jewish Agency For Israel, or JAFI, had taken over the Novatel â€” every hotel room, conference room, ballroom, the parking lot, the restaurant and even parts of the lobby, transforming them into a refugee center, consulate, logistics hub and motor pool. There, refugees would pour out of chartered buses or simply walk in from the street. They were given a place to rest, counseling and new clothing. To support this effort, JAFI has mobilized its entire global network of social workers, educators and administrators. Over one hundred JAFI employees are now operating in Poland and surrounding areas. Roman Polonsky, the managing director of JAFI, shared with me that nearly 12,000 Jews have made their way safely to Israel with another approximately 10,000 in the pipeline of shelters spreads across five countries.

The State of Israel plays a special role in this crisis. Politically, it is triangulated between wanting to support the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its Jewish president, while not wanting to antagonize Russia, which has a military base on Israelâ€™s dangerous northern border in Syria. The political balance for Israel is difficult. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has attempted to thread the needle of diplomacy by speaking with both sides and floating the idea of peace talks in Jerusalem. Israel has not sent weapons to Ukraine, but has condemned the Russian invasion on the floor of the UN and has recently sent a field hospital.

On a deeper level, Israel is similarly caught between wanting to support the general refugee efforts from Ukraine and balance that with the mass wave of immigration it is now facing. At first, Israel put up a few barriers to refugees, requiring a hefty deposit from Israelis seeking to sponsor refugees who do not wish to make aliyah (that has now been walked back), as well as changing visa agreements between Ukraine and Israel to make it harder to travel there. More recently, Israel has expedited the immigration of Ukrainian Jews under the Law of Return, securing paperwork in just a few hours for most families and chartering several immigrant-filled planes a week. Even with both the political and humanitarian difficulties, Israel continues to surpass many other countries, including the United States, when it comes to the number of refugees it is accepting into its borders.

The scale of the catastrophe for Jewish life occurring in Ukraine and Russia cannot be overstated. Beginning in the 19th century, Odessa was the third largest Jewish population center in the world. In Poland, Warsawâ€™s population was reported to be 40% Jewish before World War II. The Holocaust, as we know, changed everything. Half of Europeâ€™s Jews were murdered and millions more dispersed globally. Europe was considered by many to be a toxic wasteland whose very soil dripped with antisemitism, and the memory of the dead grits our collective jaws with sorrow and anger.

When the Soviet bloc fell in the 1990s, however, Jewish life returned to Ukraine and other Eastern European cities. With the Federationâ€™s core annual support, the Joint Distribution Committee, Hillel, Chabad and others rebuilt community centers, synagogues, and aid societies. A revitalization and renaissance of Jewish life was just sprouting. According to the best numbers we have, there are around 200,000 Jewish people in Ukraine and another 250,000 in Russia. But the story of the Jewish renaissance in Eastern Europe is shifting. The Jewish Agency is expecting as many as 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Israel from Ukraine and Russia because of this crisis, threatening some of the revitalization. There is talk of Ukraine and Russia depleting their Jewish community entirely as Jewish refugees pour into other countries. The global map of world Jewry appears to be changing again.

While Ukraine and Russia are truly under threat, the Jewish community of Poland is rising. On my first morning in Warsaw, we went to the Hillel House of Poland, built at the location of the Great Synagogue that was torched in 1943 at the end of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. On our visit there, we saw all the trappings of a vibrant Jewish life. The walls were clad with posters with kitschy phrases meant to appeal to the youth. There were program booklets for Shabbat dinners strewn about. There were wall calendars filled in with dates of programs and events yet to come. Normally, young adults would come on a regular basis to engage in Jewish life. Now, however, Hillel of Poland has been converted to a play center for families. Magda Dorosz, a dynamic educator and Executive Director of the Hillel of Poland, said that the young adults who were her clients are now her partners, volunteering to watch children so mothers and grandparents can rest. When we visited, we saw two young brothers playing in one room, while their grandparents ate perogies. â€œThe Lego Movieâ€ was playing on TV. Magda told me that this family can have an hour or two of respite here, an island of normalcy in a sea of chaos.

The city of Lublin, east of Warsaw, was an epicenter of Jewish life for hundreds of years. In the early 20th century, Rabbi Meir Shapiro established Yeshivat Chochmei Lublin, (Yeshiva of the Sages of Lublin), creating the model of modern Jewish Yeshiva education. Daf Yomi, the daily study of the Talmud over a seven-year cycle, was invented there. Rabbi Shapiro was the first Orthodox Jew to become a member of Sejm, the Polish Parliament, representing the Jewish Minority of the country. As with Warsaw, the Shoah turned centers of Jewish life into centers of Jewish death. Majdanek, the most urban of death camps, was responsible for the murder of almost 80,000 Jews from the surrounding areas, including 18,000 in one day during the grimly-named SS operation â€œHarvest Festival.â€ As with other places we visited, Jewish life was returning to Lublin. The Yeshiva was given back to the Jewish community in 2003 and reopened in 2007. The community built a four-star hotel to support visitors to the region.

The following morning, we arrived at the border of Poland and Ukraineâ€¦Mothers with children walking quietly, their faces drawn and ashen with deep circles under their eyes, their hands absent-mindedly holding on to their children, pulling them along for the thousandth time.

The hotel in Lublin has now been converted into a refugee center by the Federationâ€™s partner, the American Joint Distribution Committee (JDC). JDC, like JAFI, has significant operations on the ground in Ukraine, working with the population under fire, along the border and with refugees who have been able to escape. With the Federation partnership, JDC is currently providing some 2,000 beds in locations in Moldova, Hungary, Romania and Poland. The hotel in Lublin acts as a transition point until refugees can arrange entry to other European countries or as they wait for their aliyah papers and evacuation flights to Israel. Many of these refugees are elderly people with limited mobility, like â€œFriedreich,â€ a retired professor wearing puffy slippers, his sallow face depicting deeply cut eyes. Friedrich left the bombing in such a rush that he had no papers. Friends were able to get him to a train station where he finally crossed the border and ended up at the hotel. As we sat with him, he remained very quiet, speaking only a few words at a time. Clearly exhausted, he sat in his malcontent sipping nervously at a cup of tea and nibbling on a biscuit.

In the hotelâ€™s basement a warehouse had been organized to sort the hundreds of donated goods and clothing to help refugees. Bags of new diapers were piled to the ceiling next to a table overloaded with stuffed animals where a young boy in a hooded jacket was gleefully â€œshoppingâ€ for a soft, lovable companion to hold on to for his never-ending journey. There is something touching, even beautiful, in the irony that the hotel and the Yeshiva were brimming with the life force of the Jewish community taking care of each other only a few miles from the now ossified death camp, adding another chapter to the grand story of Jewish resiliency. They tried to murder us all, and now they are gone, and we are here, doing what we have always done for thousands of years: helping each other inscribe our names in the book of life.

The following morning, we arrived at the border of Poland and Ukraine. It was a warm and cloudless day, and the dried wheat fields shown brown and gold against the blue skyâ€”an inspiring sight that calls to mind the blue and yellow fields of the Ukrainian flag. As we alighted from the bus and approached the crossing, we noticed the silence. It was like we were living inside Annaâ€™s memory of her own journey. Mothers with children walking quietly, their faces drawn and ashen with deep circles under their eyes, their hands absent-mindedly holding on to their children, pulling them along for the thousandth time. The only noises to be heard were the Polish police, quietly directing the queue to waiting buses that were loaded quickly with aid workers offering chai, hot food, shampoo and extra clothing. It looked like a funhouse reflection of a farmerâ€™s market, where vendors from their tents were giving away their goods to a sullen and somber parade of women, children and elderly. A quietude of uncertainty mixed with despair covered the scene like a heavy blanket. No one dared to speak loudly.

The system of refugee response on behalf of our global partnership ensures that everyone, no matter their ethnicity, religion or background, are brought in and given shelter, a meal, and are directed to the most appropriate next step on their journey.

/As we moved to the border fence made of green metal, I heard Hebrew being spoken, rising above the din of other languages. I lifted my eyes and saw, waving from a makeshift pole above the very first tent nestled along the border, the blue Star of David â€” standing proudly, ready to offer to aid the tired and hungry and traumatized. The flag belongs to an Israeli group called Hatzalah bliâ€™ Gâ€™vulot, or Help without Borders. They were some of the first to arrive at the border as the war broke out. We spoke in Hebrew with the aid workers, and Areyh Levi, their representative, said there was a ninety-five-year-old Holocaust survivor who was at the refugee center a mile away. He needed a medical evacuation immediately. I said, â€œIâ€™ll pass the world and see what we can do.â€ Someone asked him if he gives aid to everyone or only to Jews. He shared that, â€œJew or no Jew, everyone is a child of God and deserves help,â€ adding, â€œ80 years ago Poland selected Jews from non-Jews. We donâ€™t do selection.â€ Indeed, the system of refugee response on behalf of our global partnership ensures that everyone, no matter their ethnicity, religion or background, are brought in and given shelter, a meal, and are directed to the most appropriate next step on their journey. Iâ€™m reminded of the portion in the Mishnah that says, â€œWe support the non-Jewish poor along with the Jewish poor, for the sake of peaceâ€ (Mishna Gittin 5:8). It demonstrated that feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and giving first aid is not something we do out of our own expediency. Itâ€™s what we do because it is a deep Jewish value that spans multiple millennia.

As we left the border, we handed out lollipops to the children. It was but a small gesture in the scope of this global crisis, but if Judaism has taught me anything, it is that the reward for doing a mitzvah is the mitzvah itself. Redemption is found not just in the apocalyptic liberation, but in the millions of acts of lovingkindness that accrue over a lifetime. Walking back to the bus, as I looked back at the border fence, the words of psalms came to my lips, â€œI shall not die, but live and proclaim the works of God â€¦ Open the gates of righteousness, so that I may proclaim the glory of Godâ€ (Psalm 118:17-19).

All of the buses that leave the border crossing flow into a refugee center more than a mile away. Just weeks ago, in another life, this refugee center was an indoor shopping mall complete with a shoe store, fast-food restaurants, clothing boutiques and a pharmacy. When we entered it was apparent that each of these stores had been hastily converted into something else. The shoe store was cleared out to become a registration booth for Polish volunteers who wanted to drive refugees in their private vehicles. Two of the clothing stores were stuffed with cots for sleeping families. The fast-food counters were converted to community kitchens, delivering hot meals, tea and coffee to refugees and volunteers alike. And everywhere there were signs scribbled on cardboard with the phone numbers, names of Facebook groups, and maps of Poland written in Russian and Ukrainian. In the back of the mall, relief agencies staked out positions, taping their flags and posters to walls, including the Jewish Agency, waving the blue-and-white. Only the pharmacy remained in full operation, working with a doctorâ€™s group to deliver medicine. Outside we met with the JDC representative who had been attending to the Holocaust survivor mentioned to us at the border. An ambulance was called in and medics were evaluating him in preparation to take him to Warsaw. As quiet as it was at the border, the refugee center was loud, bustling with hundreds of people looking for help and looking to help. The teeming mutuality of needs and charity, of volunteer and refugee, was inspiring. The rising tide of despair this war has wrought has been met with and outmatched by the rising tide of humanity. No one went unnoticed. No question went unanswered.

Imagine if Israel had existed in 1939. How many trains could be filled taking Jews to ports and ships bound for Israel instead of death camps?

It must be stated clearly that the effectiveness of the fastest global Jewish response in history to this crisis is possible because of the Federation system, its century-long relationship with the Jewish Agency and the American Joint Distribution Committee, and a strong and secure State of Israel.

The Federation system is arguably the largest Jewish volunteer project in our history. The global network that reaches into homes, synagogues and schools is the same network that ensures Jews can be saved from warzones like Ukraine. For more than a hundred years, the Federationâ€™s core annual campaigns have funded the global network between North American Jewry and the rest of the Jewish world. To date, the Federations have mobilized nearly 30 million dollars in relief funding with millions of more dollars flowing into the pipeline for this urgent need. However, many of us take this system for granted and it is only in times like these, when the system is truly needed, that we understand why the Federation asks for annual campaign dollars. As someone told me, â€œYou canâ€™t build the fire house during the inferno.â€ It is the yearly campaign that creates the infrastructure and levels of coordination that, when called upon, can move millions of dollars, set up massive refugee centers, supply temporary housing, trauma services, rail, road and air logistics. The fastest global response in Jewish history exists because of the organizational coordination of these vital organizations, funded through the Federationâ€™s annual campaign year in and year out. It is only possible because we, as a Jewish community, have made the decision to act collectively.

It also needs to be said that none of this is possible without a strong and secure State of Israel. In one of our briefings, Danielle Mor, a representative of the Jewish Agency, shared with us a telegram from February 9, 1943, years before the State was born, when the smoke from the crematoria of the Holocaust blackened Europeâ€™s sky. The London office of the Jewish Agency said that after intense negotiations with House of Commons and the Ottoman Empire, some 4,250 Jewish children could be brought to Palestine from Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. But they could only be brought 50 at a time because Turkey would not allow more people to be processed through their immigration center. In addition, once the five-year immigration limit was achieved, His majestyâ€™s government would cease the rescue operation. Knowing the fate of the Jewish population of Eastern Europe, the telegram closed by saying, â€œIf nothing else is to be done, it would take 10 months to move the 5,000 children. This is totally inadequate.â€ In hindsight, these words are truly haunting. Some eighty years later, the Jewish Agency has, in less than three weeks, moved twice as many Jews to safety than it could in 10 months. Imagine if Israel had existed in 1939. How many trains could be filled taking Jews to ports and ships bound for Israel instead of death camps? It is only because of the global Jewish relationship, between Federation, its affiliates and Israel, and the work of many other organizations, that we can look at this moment and feel that â€œnever again is now.â€

The truth is that all of the worldâ€™s children are watching us. Our own children are watching us.

As we left the refugee center, we saw a red charter bus bound for somewhere â€” where, I do not know. I saw that the adults were sitting up front, while the kids, many of them, were sitting in the rear. I thought to myself, this might be the first time on their journey that mothers didnâ€™t have to hold their children so close. Perhaps itâ€™s because they made new friends, or maybe because they slept for the first time in days. Itâ€™s hard to know. A few looked at us and waved sheepishly and smiled. As the bus turned on to the main road, heading west, I knew the lives of these child refugees were being defined by this moment. But the truth is that all of the worldâ€™s children are watching us. Our own children are watching us. Our generation is defined by what we learned from the past, but also by how we are witnessed by our future. Under our childrenâ€™s gaze we now stand. And how we act now will write the story of our time. I invite all of us to take action and lean into the Federationâ€™s global system of mutual responsibility that our forebears created for us, and that we now have the privilege to pass on to our children.

7030,Austin Weighs in on Shelling of Ukrainian Kindergarten,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Thursday said the United States is â€œstill gathering detailsâ€ about the shelling of a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine, saying the incident is â€œcertainly troubling.â€

â€œWeâ€™ve said for some time the Russians might do something like this to justify a military conflict, so weâ€™ll be watching this closely,â€ he noted.

While Ukraine's military and Russian-backed rebels both pointed fingers, Kyiv said the shelling looks like a â€œprovocation,â€ according to Reuters.

A senior Ukrainian government source said the shelling at the line of contact with Russian-backed separatist forces went beyond the scale of ceasefire violations routinely reported throughout the conflict. ""It is not typical. It looks a lot like a provocation,"" the source told Reuters. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ""seriously concerned"" about the reports of escalation. A Reuters photographer in the town of Kadiivka, in Ukraine's rebel-held Luhansk region, heard the sound of some artillery fire from the direction of the line of contact, but was not able to determine the details of the incident. The separatists accused government forces of opening fire on their territory four times in the past 24 hours. Kyiv accused the rebels of firing shells at several locations, including some that struck a kindergarten and others that hit a school where pupils had to flee to the cellar. (Reuters)

Austin, who held a press conference in Brussels, noted that while Russia claims to be withdrawing some troops, the U.S. is seeing the opposite.

â€œWe see them add to the more than 150,000 troops that they already have on that border even in the last couple of days,â€ he said. â€œWe see them fly in more combat and support aircraft, we see them sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea. We even see them stocking up their blood supplies.â€

From experience, Austin said this doesnâ€™t happen â€œfor no reason,â€ and definitely would not occur if you are serious about heading home.

From amid the rubble, blood-stained and shell-shocked people emerge, clutching their pets.

A man fleeing a bombed apartment building carries a cat and a goldfish. Some people refuse to leave Ukraine without their animals.

War exposes many truths, the brutal and the valiant. The war in Ukraine is powerfully and painfully magnifying the interconnectedness of human and animal lives, and, mercifully, our unrelenting commitment to acting with love, even in the face of lethal danger.

Domesticated animals are affected by almost every human decision and those involving violence most of all, whether theyâ€™re hidden in factory farms or captured by the lenses of photographers and broadcast globally.

Animals are always affected by war. Millions of horses and donkeys were taken from the farms of poor people to the carnage-filled fronts of the First World War and pigeons were strapped with messages.

Even to this day, military working dogs are either celebrated as heroes or unceremoniously euthanized.

(National Archives of Canada)

Animals suffer along with people

In all places where violence is a persistent poison or a swift eruption, animals suffer alongside human victims. Animals have rich intellectual and emotional lives that we are slowly beginning to recognize.

In Ukraine, they are exhibiting feelings of intense fear, pain and confusion. They apparently donâ€™t understand why their worlds are being turned upside down.

(AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)

A woman named Alisa fled Kyiv on foot with her mother, sister, children and two dogs â€” including an elderly German Shepherd named Pulya â€” and shared her experience with The Guardian.

â€œMy dog is 12 and a half and she struggled to walk and fell down every kilometre or so and couldnâ€™t stand up again. I stopped cars and asked for help but everyone refused; they advised us to leave the dogs. But our dogs are part of our family. My dog has experienced all the happy and sad moments with us. Mumâ€™s dog is all she has left of her former life. So my husband, at times, carried our dog on his shoulders.â€

My own family includes rescued German Shepherds, and the images of this 80-pound, grey-muzzled dog being carried to Poland so she would survive gripped my heart. We would do the same for our dogs. We wonâ€™t have to, and for that we are deeply grateful. But no one should have to.

Some horses are also being evacuated from Ukraine, and others are being released by hopeful people who believe the animals have the best chance of surviving on their own.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)

Horses are similarly let loose when natural disasters, like forest forest, tear through landscapes. We can anticipate and prepare for some emergencies. Others, like sudden invasions, we cannot as easily plan for â€” but we can respond in kind.

World sending help to animals

The world is responding. Neighbouring countries are allowing animals to enter with migrants â€” some, shamefully, more quickly than theyâ€™re admitting racialized people. Shelters and veterinarians are providing urgent care. Organizations globally are developing plans to accept the animals of refugees from Ukraine and beyond.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)

Some terrified animals have been transported from zoos to immediate safety. Non-profits from across Europe and around the world are sending supplies and veterinarians. They need support.

The real extent of the damage remains to be seen, but the effects will be wide-reaching. As farms and shelters run out of food, water and workers, or lose electricity, untold numbers of animals will suffer and die, quickly or very slowly.

We are all connected, within and across borders, within and across species. Ukrainians who remain and are defending the lives of others demonstrate profound bravery that resides deep in the human spirit.

Anastasiia Yalanskaya, a 26-year-old woman who refused to leave Kyiv, was killed while delivering food to an animal shelter that had been without food for three days. Another animal advocate, Natasha Derkach, was killed as she worked to save animals in Dnipro, a city under siege from heavy shelling.

There are many more victims. Ukrainians are losing their lives defending animals.

Confronting abuse

Ukraine has been creating a more humane society in many ways. Nature Watch has been working in partnership with Ukrainian organizations to confront abuse and foster a culture of care for animals.

A week before the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, 2022, I was contacted by a colleague to assist a Ukrainian city hoping to create the countryâ€™s first animal cruelty unit. My colleague later received a powerful message from an animal advocate inside Ukraine who was afraid they might never speak again.

This war has laid bare the violence of abusive men who terrorize people and animals. It has demonstrated what losing your freedom really looks like.

But the dedication Ukrainian people have shown to animals reveals that even in the most dangerous times, the human capacity for cruelty is rivalled only by our ability to be courageous and compassionate. We can be more than simply human. We can be truly humane.",https://theconversation.com/the-war-in-ukraine-is-powerfully-magnifying-our-love-for-animals-178867,Neutral
7370,Even the Taliban wants Russia and Ukraine to stop fighting,"Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has sparked near-universal condemnation â€” including, on Friday, by the Taliban.

In an official ""statement concerning [the] crisis in Ukraine,"" the Taliban, which governs Afghanistan, formally called for ""restraint by both parties"" in the crisis and expressed concern about the ""real possibility of civilian casualties.""

""All sides need to desist from taking positions that could intensify the violence,"" the group, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations and recently stormed Kabul, said.

Afghans are, of course, no strangers to Russian violence. However, the Taliban and Kremlin have been cautiously friendly toward each other since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan last year.

Kabul might have another reason for calling for calm, however: Hundreds of Afghans fled to Ukraine on evacuation flights in August 2021. ""Just like a war zone, everyone is running to the shelters, streets are full of the army,"" Jawed Haqmal, an Afghan refugee living in Kyiv, told The Globe and Mail. ""Just like war, the same as what was going on in front of the airport of Kabul on the last day. The same thing is going on here.""",https://theweek.com/russo-ukrainian-war/1010620/even-the-taliban-wants-russia-and-ukraine-to-stop-fighting,Neutral

â€œThe Ukrainian stance doesnâ€™t matter. As the last few days proved, neither President Biden or the mainstream media in the West care about the Ukrainian perspective,â€ Adriel Kasonta, a London-based foreign affairs analyst and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at the Bow Group think tank, said on Tuesday.Noting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy contradicted Bidenâ€™s claims about a potential Russian invasion in the coming days, Kasonta said that â€œone seemed to pay much attention to what he was saying.â€â€œUkrainian hawks have acknowledged the reality long before the current standoff, but we have to understand that theyâ€™ve never been true masters of their own fate. The fact that Ukraineâ€™s ambassador in London has been forced to backtrack on his previous comments made to the BBC that his country is willing to be â€˜flexibleâ€™ on its ambition to join NATO proves my point. Kiev is just another pawn on the grand chessboard used by the US to advance their goals in Eastern Europe,â€ the analyst said.â€˜Not Everything is Lostâ€™ in NATO TalksOn Monday, Ukrainian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Vadym Prystaiko said Kiev ""might agree"" not to join NATO if it would help defuse the crisis with Russia.His words elicited approval from the Kremlin, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that if Kiev did write off joining NATO, it would be â€œa step that would significantly contribute to formulating a more meaningful response to Russian concerns.â€ However, Peskov noted that it was unlikely to change Kievâ€™s worldview by itself.However, Prystaikoâ€™s words were quickly corrected by the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, with spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko tweeting that Prystaikoâ€™s words had been â€œtaken out of context.â€â€œThe goal of NATO membership is enshrined in the Constitution of Ukraine and no decisions can contradict it. The matter of security guarantees for Ukraine is urgent,â€ Nikolenko added. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also said that the issue of Ukraineâ€™s membership in NATO was up to Ukraine and the 30 NATO member states.Despite Kiev doubling down on NATO membership, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted on Tuesday that NATO had recently begun changing its positions and was taking Russian security concerns more seriously than it has in years.While the issue of NATOâ€™s so-called â€œopen doorâ€ membership policy remains Russiaâ€™s primary concern, Lavrov noted other areas that NATO has reacted more favorably, including a moratorium on intermediate-range missiles in the region following Washingtonâ€™s destruction of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019. That deal had dramatically reduced tensions by banning missiles with dangerously short flight times, but the US withdrawal made it possible for US Aegis Ashore stations in Romania and Poland that Washington had declared purely defensive could be refitted to fire strike missiles with ranges reaching deep inside Russian territory.Lavrov also noted Poland's proposal to revive the informal dialogue on European security within the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), saying that such proposals show an ""understanding of existing issues,"" as well as a ""willingness"" to deal with them.Posturing for PosterityHowever, NATO isnâ€™t the same thing as the United States. Kasonta told Sputnik that â€œitâ€™ll take some timeâ€ until Washington starts taking Russiaâ€™s concerns seriously.â€œThe more they'll fear an assertive China, the more theyâ€™ll try to pretend that they understand Russiaâ€™s concerns and accept [Russia] as an equal partner. Nevertheless, it will never be an honest admission. They need Moscow to help them balance Beijing. Itâ€™s as simple as that.â€For Kasonta, Bidenâ€™s posturing as strong against Moscow and Beijing is essential to keep his administration afloat.â€œBiden is desperate to find his place in history, and this cheap chutzpah is how he is goingto be remembered beyond the so-called â€˜Western world,â€™â€ he added, noting the â€œsame applies to Boris Johnson in the UK.â€As an example, he predicted that Western leaders in general, but Biden in particular, would â€œexploit military drills in Belarus to their advantageâ€ by ignoring Moscowâ€™s transparency about the scheduling of those drills to â€œscore some easy political points both at home and on the international stage.â€As a result, Kasonta noted that â€œthe West canâ€™t be trustedâ€ because of how it views Russia and Russians.â€œIf they had been acting in good faith, we wouldn't see this dangerous, warmongering show. Itâ€™s as simple as that. Moscow has to draw the correct conclusions and adjust its politics to the given circumstances. Being naive about the West and its ultimate intentions vis-Ã -vis Moscow can prove to be very dangerous for the future generations of Russians.â€

1235,"Amid global threat, prayers for peace at Ukrainian Church in Omaha","OMAHA â€” Three days before the Russian bombs begin to fall, the lights of the Ukrainian Catholic Church chapel flip on.

The Rev. Petro Kozar opens his arms to the congregation to begin the Sunday morning service. He takes a censer of incense. He swings it and it clangs.

The smoke symbolizes the congregationâ€™s prayers rising to heaven.

The 24 people in the pews sing a hymn in Ukrainian. Older congregants, some who have been here nearly every Sunday since the church was founded by people fleeing Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, know every word.

The service continues with prayers for peace in English and Ukrainian, but no mention of the topic on everyoneâ€™s mind: the looming possibility that Vladimir Putin would invade these Nebraskansâ€™ homeland.

At serviceâ€™s end, the Right Rev. Archimandrite Ivan Krotec finally addresses it to the congregation: â€œLet us continue to pray for Ukraine,â€ he says. â€œWe donâ€™t know what is going to happen, but we believe God is stronger.â€

The congregation of Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Ukrainian Church, located just south of downtown Omaha, continues to watch developments in Ukraine, including Wednesdayâ€™s invasion by Russia, with a mix of anger, sadness and growing dread.

The elders in this community immigrated as children to the United States after the horrors of World War II. Some were taken by the Nazis to do forced labor in Germany. Then they watched Stalin â€” and now Putin â€” ravage their homeland.

â€œPutin has always wanted Ukraine. He wants the former Soviet Union,â€ said Daria Blazauskas, 83, whose memories of a Nazi labor camp are still vivid eight decades later. â€œIf he gets Ukraine, heâ€™s going after the Baltic (States) next.â€

The church also consists of their children, who work to keep older traditions alive. In the chatter after the service, itâ€™s easy to pick out the accents of more recent immigrants, also wrestling with dread.

â€œIt just looks like a game of wise people right now,â€ said Iuliia Grytsyk, 34, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, who moved to the United States as a student 15 years ago and is now a U.S. citizen. â€œSomething is trying to prove something to someone else and innocent citizens have to suffer.â€

Olesia Repichowskyj, 88, recites the lines from an old Ukrainian poet: â€œUkraine will rise again and blow away the gloom of servitude.â€

She talks about how Ukraine was controlled by Czarist Russia for centuries. About her childhood in Soviet-controlled Ukraine, where a man-made famine killed a third of her village.

She explains how her village church was shuttered and turned into a granary under Stalin. â€œThe priest disappeared. We didnâ€™t know if he was shipped to Siberia or if he was killed,â€ she said.

And she can tell you about how members of her family were hauled to Nazi Germany in a boxcar with straw lining the floor. She was separated from them and forced to work on farms.

Rather than return to the Soviet Union, the reunited family immigrated to the U.S. She married and moved to Omaha in 1964 when her husband took a job with Leo Daly, the architectural and engineering firm.

To her, Ukraineâ€™s current troubles are part of a long history of Russia trying to dominate the country, which has good soil and warm-water Black Sea ports long coveted by Russian leaders.

â€œThey need that good soil,â€ she said. â€œThey need a place where they can grow food so they can feed themselves. Putin wants to rebuild the Soviet Union. And it isnâ€™t just Ukraine that he wants.â€

Tyler White, director of the University of Nebraska-Lincolnâ€™s National Security Program, said that Ukraine has long been subject to Russian whims and â€œhas never gotten anything good out of the deal.â€

Ukraine, briefly independent after World War I, was soon conquered by the new Soviet Union.

In the 1930s, the country was ravaged by the so-called Holodomor, a famine that started after Stalin attempted to collectivize agriculture. It led to 4 million deaths.

At the dawn of the Cold War, the allies allowed Ukrainians to immigrate to several countries, including the United States.

Blazauskas was 12 when her family boarded a bus and crossed the Missouri River on a July 1950 night. She saw the lights of Omaha for the first time.

â€œFor me, as a child, I looked and thought, â€˜Oh! Itâ€™s Christmas!â€ she said.

The Ukrainian Catholics purchased their current house of worship, which features a small golden dome topped by a cross, at 16th and Martha streets in 1951. They remodeled, paid off the mortgage, and dug the basement where people gather after services today.

It is one of two Ukrainian Catholic Churches in Nebraska. The other: St. George in Lincoln's Belmont neighborhood.

The early generation of Ukrainian immigrants in Omaha raised children who scattered across the city but often return to the old neighborhood on Sunday mornings.

Orest Lechnowsky, 54, grew up in the church co-founded by his father. He remembers a childhood of traditional foods, embroidered Ukrainian clothes, Ukrainian poetry and spectacularly dyed Easter eggs. â€œWeâ€™ve pretty much been immersed in it for our whole lives,â€ he said.

David Woloszyn, 39, is studying to be a church deacon. He has a tattoo on his right forearm that says: â€œUkrainian Pride.â€

â€œThe sad thing is we will fight for our independence again,â€ Woloszyn said. â€œThe sad thing is there is going to be a lot of innocent blood shed.â€

After the fall of the Soviet Union, many congregants visited their relatives in Ukraine for the first time. Lechnowsky first went back with his father in the 1990s.

â€œIt was very emotional. My dad was from a small village in the Carpathian Mountains,â€ he said. â€œThey were still farming with 19th-century equipment. Everything was horse-drawn or human-powered. No one had cars.â€

Lechnowsky has been back several times. Family and friends in Ukraine have now evacuated their children from the country or moved them as far west in Ukraine as possible, where itâ€™s presumed to be safer.

â€œMore and more people are joining territorial defense units, taking training on the weekends,â€ he said. â€œThere have been dramatic increases in the purchase of firearms and ammunition â€¦ I think there is a determination to defend their homes.â€

In the Omaha church, nearly everyone knows this fact: After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had the third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world.

It gave them up.

The accord signed by the U.S., Russia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom assured Ukraine that its borders would be respected. In 1996, the last of its nuclear weapons left the country.

Itâ€™s hard to imagine Putin invading Ukraine if the country still had those weapons, UNL's White said.

In 2014, Russian troops took control of the Crimean Region, and annexed it. Since then, violence between the Ukrainian Military and pro-Russian separatist forces has killed more than 14,000 people. That bloodshed appears to have served as a precursor for an all-out Russian invasion, which began Wednesday evening.

By Thursday afternoon in Omaha, the invasion had killed dozens of Ukrainian soldiers and wounded many more. The Russians appeared to be in control of the Chernobyl nuclear site, and had pushed into the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.

â€œPutin is planning this game to try to invigorate Russia as an international power player. He doesnâ€™t have a very strong hand at home. This military adventurism is a very good way of distracting the people at home,â€ White said. â€œThis is less about what the Russian people want and itâ€™s a lot more about what Putin wants.â€

Everyone at the church criticizes Putin. On Sunday, no one at the church was cheering for war. No one suggested that U.S. troops be sent to Ukraine.

â€œWe are all made in the image and likeness of God. All the Slavic people, whether it be from Belarus, Ukraine, or Russia, we all descended from the same heavenly father,â€ Woloszyn said. â€œWeâ€™re brothers.â€

The Flatwater Free Press is Nebraskaâ€™s first independent, nonprofit newsroom focused on investigations and feature stories that matter.

9579,African refugees see racial bias as US welcomes Ukrainians,"Wilfred Tebah doesnâ€™t begrudge the U.S. for swiftly granting humanitarian protections to Ukrainians escaping Russiaâ€™s devastating invasion of their homeland.

But the 27-year-old, who fled Cameroon during its ongoing conflict, canâ€™t help but wonder what would happen if the millions fleeing that Eastern Europe nation were a different hue.

As the U.S. prepares to welcome tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing war, the country continues to deport scores of African and Caribbean refugees back to unstable and violent homelands where theyâ€™ve faced rape, torture, arbitrary arrest and other abuses.

â€œThey do not care about a Black man,â€ the Columbus, Ohio, resident said, referring to U.S. politicians. â€œThe difference is really clear. They know what is happening over there, and they have decided to close their eyes and ears.â€

Tebahâ€™s concerns echo protests against the swift expulsions of Haitian refugees crossing the border this summer without a chance to seek asylum, not to mention the frosty reception African and Middle Eastern refugees have faced in western Europe compared with how those nations have enthusiastically embraced displaced Ukrainians.

In March, when President Joe Biden made a series of announcements welcoming 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, granting Temporary Protected Status to another 30,000 already in the U.S. and halting Ukrainian deportations, two Democratic lawmakers seized on the moment to call for similar humanitarian considerations for Haitians.

â€œThere is every reason to extend the same level of compassion,â€ U.S. Reps. Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts, and Mondaire Jones, of New York, wrote to the administration, noting more than 20,000 Haitians have been deported despite continued instability after the assassination of Haitiâ€™s president and a powerful earthquake this summer.

Cameroonian advocates have similarly ratcheted up their calls for humanitarian relief, protesting in front of the Washington residence of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the offices of leading members of Congress this month.

Their calls come as hundreds of thousands in Cameroon have been displaced in recent years by the countryâ€™s civil war between its French-speaking government and English-speaking separatists, attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram and other regional conflicts.

The advocacy group Human Rights Watch, in a February report, found many Cameroonians deported from the U.S. suffered persecution and human rights violations upon returning there.

Tebah, who is a leading member of the Cameroon American Council, an advocacy group organizing protests this month, said thatâ€™s a fate he hopes to avoid.

Hailing from the countryâ€™s English-speaking northwest, he said he was branded a separatist and apprehended by the government because of his activism as a college student. Tebah said he managed to escape, as many Cameroonians have, by flying to Latin America, trekking overland to the U.S.-Mexico border and petitioning for asylum in 2019.

â€œI will be held in prison, tortured and even killed if I am deported,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m very scared. As a human, my life matters too.â€

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees TPS and other humanitarian programs, declined to respond to the complaints of racism in American immigration policy. It also declined to say whether it was weighing granting TPS to Cameroonians or other African nationals, saying in a written statement only that it will â€œcontinue to monitor conditions in various countries.â€

The agency noted, however, that it has recently issued TPS designations for Haiti, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan â€” all African or Caribbean nations â€” as well as to more than 75,000 Afghans living in the U.S. after the Taliban takeover of that Central Asian nation. Haitians are among the largest and longest-tenured beneficiaries of TPS, with more than 40,000 currently on the status.

Other TPS countries include Burma, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen, and the majority of the nearly 320,000 immigrants with Temporary Protected Status hail from El Salvador.

Lisa Parisio, who helped launch Catholics Against Racism in Immigration, argues the program could easily help protect millions more refugees fleeing danger but has historically been underused and overpoliticized.

TPS, which provides a work permit and staves off deportation for up to 18 months, doesnâ€™t have limits for how many countries or people can be placed on it, said Parisio, who is the advocacy director for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network.

Yet former President Donald Trump, in his broader efforts to restrict immigration, pared down TPS, allowing designations for Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa to expire.

Although programs like TPS provide critical protections for vulnerable refugees, they can also leave many in legal limbo for years without providing a pathway to citizenship, said Karla Morales, a 24-year-old from El Salvador who has been on TPS nearly her whole life.

â€œItâ€™s absurd to consider 20 years in this country temporary,â€ the University of Massachusetts Boston nursing student said. â€œWe need validation that the work weâ€™ve put in is appreciated and that our lives have value.â€

At least in the case of Ukraine, Biden appears motivated by broader foreign policy goals in Europe, rather than racial bias, suggests MarÃ­a Cristina GarcÃ­a, a history professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, focused on refugees and immigrants.

But Tom Wong, founding director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Center at the University of California, San Diego, said the racial disparities couldnâ€™t be clearer.

â€œThe U.S. has responded without hesitation by extending humanitarian protections to predominately white and European refugees,â€ he said. â€œAll the while, predominately people of color from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia continue to languish.â€

Besides Cameroon, immigrant advocates also argue that Congo and Ethiopia should qualify for humanitarian relief because of their ongoing conflicts, as should Mauritania, since slavery is still practiced there.

And they complain Ukrainian asylum seekers are being exempted from asylum limits meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 while those from other nations are being turned away.

â€œBlack pain and Black suffering do not get the same attention,â€ says Sylvie Bello, founder of the D.C.-based Cameroon American Council. â€œThe same anti-Blackness that permeates American life also permeates American immigration policy.â€

Vera Arnot, a Ukrainian in Boston who is considering seeking TPS, says she didnâ€™t know much about the special status until the war started and wasnâ€™t aware of the concerns from immigrants of color. But the Berklee College of Music sophomore hopes the relief can be extended to other deserving nations.

Arnot says TPS could help her seek an off-campus job with better pay so she doesnâ€™t have to rely on her familyâ€™s support, as most in Ukraine have lost their jobs due to the war.

â€œUkrainians as a people arenâ€™t used to relying on others,â€ she said. â€œWe want to work. We donâ€™t want welfare.â€

For Tebah, who is staying with relatives in Ohio, TPS would make it easier for him to open a bank account, get a driverâ€™s license and seek better employment while he awaits a decision on his asylum case.

â€œWeâ€™ll continue to beg, to plead,â€ Tebah said. â€œWe are in danger. I want to emphasize it. And only TPS for Cameroon will help us be taken out of that danger. It is very necessary.â€

7906,Ukraine Shows The World Why Gun Rights Are Human Rights,"The world is captivated by Ukraineâ€™s resistance to Russian invasion, especially since much of Ukraineâ€™s resistance comes from ordinary citizens taking up arms in defense of their homeland.

Ukraine has a fighting chance in part because it has taken dramatic steps to provide its people firearms. More than 25,000 automatic rifles and 10 million rounds of ammunition have been distributed to volunteers in Kyiv.

In the United States, even supporters of draconian gun control are announcing they â€œstand with the brave Ukrainian peopleâ€ in their armed resistance. The glaring contradiction between these positions â€” supporting gun confiscation one day and gun distribution the next â€” seemingly hasnâ€™t dawned on many of these ideologues.

Their contradiction is apparent in actions, as well as in words. President Joe Bidenâ€™s rush to arm Ukrainians stands in contrast with his desire to disarm ordinary Americans.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is another prime example: engaging in tyrannical gun control at home while supplying the Ukrainian resistance with machine guns, pistols, carbines, and 1.5 million rounds of ammunition. The European Union shows a similar hostility to the self-defense rights of its people, even as it gives Ukraine about half a billion dollarsâ€™ worth of â€œlethal aid.â€

Ukraine Late to Expand Gun Rights

Arming average citizens hasnâ€™t always been the Ukrainian way, either. A 2014 report noted that the country had â€œinherited the Soviet civilian gun control system, which provides for restrictive gun owner licensing and the registration of all firearms.â€ According to that report, Ukraine initially considered imposing comprehensive gun laws during the 1990s. But politicians gridlocked over â€œwhether or not private [gun] ownership would increase crime or improve security.â€

Hopefully the events of 2022 have settled that question once and for all. An individualâ€™s natural right of self-defense applies equally to the defense of his life as to the defense of his nation â€” and neither individual nor nation is secure without the ability to exercise it. This should never have been a question.

As it happened, Ukraine was tragically late to expand legal protection of gun rights. Its parliament acted on an emergency basis just before Russia invaded.

Better late than never, certainly. But imagine if the people of Kyiv had been training with these weapons their whole lives. Imagine if they knew them like the back of their hands, instead of quickly learning to handle them during an invasion. Their resistance, as well as their example to the world, would be all the more powerful.

Natural Right to Bear Arms

Itâ€™s also unfortunate that Ukraineâ€™s government has left some significant restrictions on the self-defense rights of the Ukrainian people, and has only codified these rights in a statute rather than giving them full constitutional protection. In reality, the right to bear arms â€” in public and private â€” is a natural right that the Ukrainian people need no government permission to exercise. They just need the government to stay out of the way of their natural rights.

But in a time even many U.S. jurisdictions violate that natural right, itâ€™s not surprising if other countries are confused about it.

Ukraine is certainly moving in the right direction on gun rights, something that canâ€™t be said of the entire United States. The chairman of Ukraineâ€™s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, says the new law is meant â€œto ensure that every citizen receives the sacred right to self-defense.â€

The people of Ukraine have a chance because they are armed. Itâ€™s a lesson the world should never forget.",https://thefederalist.com/2022/03/04/ukraine-shows-the-world-why-gun-rights-are-human-rights/,Anti-Russian
8194,Europe Can Handle Ukrainian Refugeesâ€”for Now. But Will It Need Americaâ€™s Help?,"Unfortunately, there are already some troubling indications of this precise strategy shift, with an increase in documented instances of Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure and reports of its use of potent thermobaric weapons in cities. A vicious and prolonged campaign to break Ukrainian morale will, as a matter of course, drive many more people to leave the country. At a certain volume and over a long enough period of time, the warm welcome of those fleeing the carnage and chaos will inevitably wear thin.

Domestic political audiences, no matter how initially eager to receive refugee populations, will always eventually tire, particularly as narratives develop over the provision of social services and the unavoidable temporary stretching of public programs that tends to accompany these arrivals. If the Ukrainian refugee population starts heading into the four, five, or six million range, itâ€™s possible theyâ€™ll overwhelm Europeâ€™s practical or political capacity to welcome them in full.

This is where the U.S. is likely to step in. The Ukrainian-American community and several lawmakers are calling for the U.S. to be more meticulous and preemptive in setting up resettlement processes for Ukrainian refugees, taking lessons from its disastrously botched efforts to evacuate Afghans following last yearâ€™s withdrawal. The administration has already moved aggressively to protect Ukrainians, taking just one week from the start of the invasion to designate the country for Temporary Protected Status, giving all Ukrainians currently in the U.S. a potential shield from deportation, and the ability to obtain work permits regardless of their prior status.",https://newrepublic.com/article/165670/ukraine-refugee-resettlement-us-immigration,Anti-Russian
8911,"After fleeing Ukraine, 15-year-old twins cram to catch up at school in Paris","Paris: Weeks after fleeing Kyiv with their mother and arriving in Paris, 15-year-old twins Masha and Sasha Litkovska have already started high school in the French capital and are cramming to get to grips with the language.

They are among nearly 90 Ukrainians who have transferred to high schools in Paris and the rest of the Ile-de-France region in recent weeks.

There are 700 spots available in the Ile-de-France for foreign students in need and most of them this year are expected to be allocated to people fleeing Ukraine following Russiaâ€™s invasion, according to Christophe Kerrero, Parisâ€™s chief academic officer.

So far, the girls have spent most of their time taking French as a second language class, where they are being helped by two other students, originally from Russia and Kazakhstan, who translate for them.

â€œThe objective - since these two students are really beginners in the French language - is to get them to master the language as soon as possible, so they can pursue their studies in France if they stay,â€ said their teacher Sarah Czarnobroda.

While the twins are adapting to their new life, they remain anxious about their father, a police officer, who has stayed at home in Kyiv to fight.

530,DNC Lawyer Michael Sussmann Fires Back At Special Counsel Durham - Above the Law,"On Friday, Special Counsel John Durham filed a Motion to Inquire Into Potential Conflicts of Interest between attorney Michael Sussmann and his counsel at Latham & Watkins. Itâ€™s been five months since Durham indicted Sussmann, a former Perkins Coie lawyer charged with one count of lying to James Baker, then the general counsel of the FBI, in 2016.

And yet it only just occurred to Durham to mention this conflict now. Out of the goodness of his heart.

Or perhaps not. A person given to less charitable interpretation might think that he larded the motion with a bunch of irrelevant, suggestive material, then dropped it the weekend before the Super Bowl to allow the right wing media ecosphere time to spin the story into the next Watergate before anyone else got around to debunking it.

Durham says that Rodney Joffe, Sussmannâ€™s client who examined the DNS traffic around politically sensitive entities in the way of the Russian hack of the DNC, â€œexploited this arrangement by mining the [White House]â€™s DNS traffic and other data for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump.â€ By way of background, Joffeâ€™s firm Neustar was collecting bulk traffic data, and noticed weird contacts between Trump Tower and Russian servers and phones at the very moment Russians had hacked the DNC, were crawling all over our election infrastructure, and seeding our social media feeds with anti-Hillary memes. He brought the data to Sussmann, who brought it to the FBI.

Durham made further reference to a February 2017 meeting Sussmann had with the CIA, during which he accused Sussmann of telling the same â€œlieâ€ he told Baker, i.e. that he was not there on behalf of a particular client when he was actually representing the Clinton campaign. (When was Trump inaugurated again?)

Immediately the right wing ecosphere went wild, accusing Clinton of paying Joffe to spy on Trump at the White House and in Trump Tower. Hereâ€™s Tucker Carlson last night baselessly accusing the Clinton campaign of stealing emails and text messages.

Tucker: The filing says they intercepted Internet traffic, that is e-mails presumably text messages pic.twitter.com/7V6uKcGMEr â€” Acyn (@Acyn) February 15, 2022

By Sunday, Trump was braying for executions.

â€œIn a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death. In addition, reparations should be paid to those in our country who have been damaged by this,â€ he howled.

Literally none of that was true, since Joffe was the one who paid Sussmann, not the other way around. And in fact Joffe had legitimate access to the data, all of which predated Trumpâ€™s inauguration.

Hereâ€™s a footnote from Sussmannâ€™s response, filed today:

For example, although the Special Counsel implies that in Mr. Sussmannâ€™s February 9, 2017 meeting, he provided Agency-2 with EOP data from after Mr. Trump took office, the Special Counsel is well aware that the data provided to Agency-2 pertained only to the period of time before Mr. Trump took office, when Barack Obama was President. Furtherâ€”and contrary to the Special Counselâ€™s alleged theory that Mr. Sussmann was acting in concert with the Clinton Campaignâ€”the Motion conveniently overlooks the fact that Mr. Sussmannâ€™s meeting with Agency-2 happened well after the 2016 presidential election, at a time when the Clinton Campaign had effectively ceased to exist. Unsurprisingly, the Motion also omits any mention of the fact that Mr. Sussmann never billed the Clinton Campaign for the work associated with the February 9, 2017 meeting, nor could he have (because there was no Clinton Campaign). See Dkt. No. 35 at 3- 4. And the Special Counsel persists in alleging that Mr. Sussmann billed the Clinton Campaign for his meeting with the FBI in September 2016, when that is false as well.

Sussmann is now moving to strike language from Durhamâ€™s filing which is â€œprejudicialâ€”and falseâ€”allegations that are irrelevant to his Motion and to the charged offense, and are plainly intended to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool.â€

â€œThese allegations were not included in the Indictment; these allegations post-date the single false statement that was charged in the Indictment; and these allegations were not necessary to identify any of the potential conflicts of interest with which the Motion is putatively concerned,â€ Sussman writes of the allegations about his conduct in February of 2017. â€œWhy then include them? The question answers itself.â€

Noting that heâ€™s well aware of whatever â€œconflictsâ€ the Special Counsel purports to be concerned about and has already waived them, Sussmann urges the court to â€œstrike the Factual Background portion of the Special Counselâ€™s motion pursuant to the Courtâ€™s inherent power to â€˜fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.â€™â€

But whether or not US District Judge Christopher Cooper agrees to Sussmannâ€™s request, he can hardly halt the spread of Durhamâ€™s false narrative about the Clinton campaign. Because federal judges are powerful, but they canâ€™t order toothpaste back in the tube. That damage is already done.

156,Democracy in constant need of protection,"The new year is ushering in an unprecedented test for democracies. Democracy around the globe is in peril. As historyâ€™s most effective and fair form of government, democracy is confronting a confluence of crises.

Freedom House succinctly sums up the global situation. â€œAs a lethal pandemic, economic and physical insecurity, and violent conflict ravaged the world, democracyâ€™s defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny,â€ it found.

The world is in the midst of the 15th consecutive year of democratic backsliding. Authoritarianism is on the march. In a brazen example in the heart of Europe, the democratically elected government of Ukraine is under threat by Russia, which has massed nearly 100,000 troops along their common border. From Hungary to Tanzania to Turkey and beyond, elected leaders are attacking civil society, media and oversight institutions, and spreading disinformation.

Some governments have used the pandemic to deploy emergency powers that restrict civil liberties. In addition, citizen trust in government across democracies has plummeted. The United States entered 2022 reliving the horror of the Jan. 6 assault on its democracy. This year, elections across several major democracies â€” Brazil, India, the Philippines among others â€” will serve as a litmus test on whether leaders with authoritarian tendencies prevail.

But there are signs of hope and promise. The end of 2021 saw major global forums â€” such as the U.S. Summit for Democracy and the Global Summit of the 78-country Open Government Partnership (OGP) â€” convening a countervailing force to renew democracy and push back against the rise of authoritarianism.

A new study published by the organization I lead (OGP) assessed democratic reforms implemented over the past decade in scores of countries around the world. It highlights hundreds of transformative efforts that are building citizen trust in democratic governance by making government more open and accountable. Specifically, courageous reformers and activists over the past decade are advancing four broad categories of reforms that can protect and renew democracy going forward.

The first category â€” opening opaque institutions to fight corruption. Today, 70 governments from Argentina to Ukraine are opening procurement contracts to end corrupt backroom deals. At a time when the Panama and Pandora Papers have unmasked illicit wealth stashed in anonymous corporations, 30 countries like Armenia, Nigeria and the UK are opening up about who really owns the companies. In another example, Colombia is empowering citizen auditors to monitor COVID-19 stimulus spending on a mobile app to ensure it reaches intended beneficiaries.

The second category â€” empowering citizens to shape and oversee policies and services that affect their lives, particularly at the local level, such as participatory budgeting in Madrid or citizens monitoring services in Kaduna, Nigeria. Reformers are convening people across political divides in citizensâ€™ assemblies to forge shared solutions on contentious policies such as same-sex marriage in Ireland or climate justice in France.

The third category â€” empowering historically marginalized communities, such as enhancing access to justice for the Roma minority in North Macedonia, or empowering women by targeting the gender wage gap in Jalisco, Mexico.

The fourth category â€” confronting threats to democracy, such as the Netherlands and Canada strengthening the transparency of online political campaigns to curb disinformation.

The imperative now is to scale up these reforms to tackle societal crises and reignite confidence in democracy as the most viable and potent form of government for addressing the needs of people.

The Canadian writer Margaret Atwood noted the duality of democracy â€” its great power to transform whole nations for the better and yet its own vulnerability and need for constant nurturing.

â€œThe fabric of democracy is always fragile everywhere because it depends on the will of citizens to protect it,â€ she wrote. â€œAnd when they become scared, when it becomes dangerous for them to defend it, it can go very quickly.â€

The mission of all peoples during this period of unprecedented peril must be to join forces to demand and advance reforms that renew democracy â€” and protect this most cherished of gifts.

769,Ukraine-Russia crisis: What to know in the escalating crisis,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) â€” Efforts by world leaders to head off a Russian invasion of Ukraine were dealt a serious blow Monday when Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognizing the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and ordered his military to â€œmaintain peaceâ€ there.

But Putinâ€™s moves, made as shelling continued in those regions, could be a precursor to the Kremlin sending in troops and weapons to support the separatists. Doing so is sure to deepen already inflamed tensions between Russia and the West.

The U.N. Security Council held a rare nighttime emergency meeting at the request of Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries.

Ukraineâ€™s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sought to project calm, telling the country: â€œWe are not afraid of anyone or anything. We donâ€™t owe anyone anything. And we wonâ€™t give anything to anyone.â€

The White House said earlier Monday that President Joe Biden had agreed â€œin principleâ€ to meeting Putin, but only if the Kremlin refrains from launching an assault on Ukraine. Even before any invasion, however, both Biden and the European Union said they would move ahead with targeted sanctions in response to Putinâ€™s decrees.

The White House issued an executive order to prohibit Americans from investing and doing business in the separatist regions.

A Biden-Putin meeting would offer some new hope of averting a Russian invasion that U.S. officials said appeared imminent, as an estimated 150,000 Russian troops await Putinâ€™s orders to strike. It was uncertain when â€” or if â€” troops massing at the border would enter Ukraine.

Here is a look at the latest developments in the security crisis in Eastern Europe:

PUTIN DECREES INDEPENDENCE FOR SEPARATIST REGIONS

In a long, ranting speech during a meeting of his Security Council, Putin charged that Ukraine had inherited Russiaâ€™s historic lands and after the Soviet collapse was used by the West to contain Russia.

Putinâ€™s decrees allow Russia to sign treaties with the two separatist regions. In the meantime, they say Russia will provide military assistance to â€œmaintain peace.â€

Western officials fear that Russia could invade Ukraine any moment, using skirmishes in eastern Ukraine as a pretext for an attack.

The decision effectively shatters the 2015 Minsk peace agreements, which ended large-scale fighting. Violence has still simmered and seen a spike in recent weeks in the wider crisis.

The meeting of Putinâ€™s Security Council followed televised statements by separatist leaders, who pleaded with Putin to recognize their regions as independent states and sign friendship treaties envisaging military aid to protect them from what they described as an ongoing Ukrainian military offensive. Russiaâ€™s lower house made the same plea last week.

Ukrainian authorities deny launching an offensive and accuse Russia of provocation as shelling intensifies along the line of contact.

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL?

Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo opened the session late Monday with a warning that â€œthe risk of major conflict is real and needs to be prevented at all costs.â€

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Putin â€œhas put before the world a choiceâ€ and it â€œmust not look awayâ€ because â€œhistory tells us that looking the other way in the face of such hostility will be a far more costly path.â€

Russiaâ€™s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said Putin acted in response to Ukrainian aggression. He said Russia was open to diplomacy but wouldnâ€™t allow â€œa new bloodbath in the Donbas.â€

Chinaâ€™s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun called for restraint and a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

WILL BIDEN AND PUTIN MEET?

The U.S. and Russian presidents have tentatively agreed to meet in a last-ditch diplomatic effort to stave off another invasion of Ukraine. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

Yet both seem cautious about a possible meeting.

The White House says the meeting will only happen if Russia does not invade Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, for his part, said â€œitâ€™s premature to talk about specific plans for a summit.â€

French President Emmanuel Macron sought to broker the possible meeting between Biden and Putin in a series of phone calls that dragged deep into Sunday night. Macronâ€™s office said both leaders had â€œaccepted the principle of such a summit,â€ to be followed by a broader meeting involving other leaders, too.

The White House said Biden on Monday conferred with Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during a 30-minute call.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were to lay the groundwork for the summit at a meeting Thursday, according to Macronâ€™s office.

Blinken spoke with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba after Putinâ€™s declaration and planned to meet with him on Tuesday in Washington, the State Department said.

WHATâ€™S THE SITUATION ON UKRAINEâ€™S EASTERN FRONT?

Heavy shelling has increased in recent days along the tense line of contact between Ukrainian forces and the Russian-backed separatist rebels in Ukraineâ€™s industrial heartland of Donbas.

The conflict began after Russiaâ€™s annexation of Crimea and has claimed at least 14,000 lives.

Ukrainian military spokesman Pavlo Kovalchyuk said Ukrainian positions were shelled 80 times Sunday and eight times early Monday, noting that the separatists were â€œcynically firing from residential areas using civilians as shields.â€ He said Ukrainian forces werenâ€™t returning fire.

In the village of Novognativka on the government-controlled side, 60-year-old Ekaterina Evseeva said the shelling was worse than at the height of fighting.

â€œItâ€™s worse than 2014,â€ she said, her voice trembling. â€œWe are on the edge of nervous breakdowns. And there is nowhere to run.â€

RUSSIAN TROOPS STAY IN BELARUS, ADDING TO FEARS

Russian troops who have been carrying out military exercises in Belarus, which is located on Ukraineâ€™s northern border, were supposed to go home when those war games ended Sunday. But now Moscow and Minsk say that the Russian troops are staying indefinitely.

The continued deployment of the Russian forces in Belarus raised concerns that Russia could send those troops to sweep down on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, a city of 3 million less than a three-hour drive rom the Belarusian border.

UKRAINE PROJECTS CALM

Despite Bidenâ€™s assertion that Putin has made the decision to roll Russian forces into Ukraine, Ukrainian officials sought to project calm, saying they werenâ€™t seeing an invasion as imminent.

Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Monday that Russia has amassed 147,000 troops around Ukraine, including 9,000 in Belarus, arguing that the number is insufficient for an offensive on the Ukrainian capital.

â€œThe talk about an attack on Kyiv from the Belarusian side sounds ridiculous,â€ he said, charging that Russia is using the troops there to create fear.

Over the weekend at the Polish border, many Ukrainians were also returning home from shopping or working in the neighboring EU country. Some said they were not afraid and vowed to take up arms against Russia in case of an assault.

EU OFFERS TO ADVISE UKRAINE

For all the posturing and vows of reprisal from Western leaders, direct military intervention has thus far been ruled out. Kuleba, Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister, said Monday the European Union has agreed to set up a military education advisory mission in his country.

Kuleba told reporters in Brussels after meeting with the blocâ€™s foreign ministers that an agreement had been reached in principle to roll out the advisory training military mission.

â€œThis is not combat forces,â€ he said. â€œThis is a new element in the cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union.â€

The move could involve sending European officers to Ukraineâ€™s military schools to help educate its armed forces. Itâ€™s likely to take several months to set up.

Russia has sought promises from NATO that it would never offer membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet republics, a condition that the West has rejected.

The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, spoke Monday with the commander in chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, Lt. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny.

Milley called Ukraine a key partner to NATO, according to the Pentagonâ€™s summary of the phone call.

THE LATEST BRITISH WARNINGS

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was preparing to speak to Zelenskyy and â€œoffer him the support of the United Kingdom.â€

Earlier, Britainâ€™s defense secretary, Ben Wallace, urged Putin to turn away from military action and pursue diplomacy not just for the sake of Ukrainians but to prevent Russian deaths.

Russians know the consequences of the past actions, including the invasion of Afghanistan and Russiaâ€™s invasion of Chechnya, he said.

â€œThese are just two examples when too many young men returned home in zinc-lined coffins, and the government therefore urges President Putin for the sake of his own people, and even at this 11th hour, to rule out the invasion of Ukraine,â€ he said.

Wallace told the House of Commons that Putin had continued to build up forces in the region. Russia has now massed 65% of its land combat power on the Ukrainian border, he said.

U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the West was preparing â€œfor the worst-case scenario,â€ adding: â€œWe must make the cost for Russia intolerably high.â€

8840,Calling Ukraine â€œRelatively Civilizedâ€ Invokes a Racist Ranking of Europeanness,"Part of the Series Russia's War on Ukraine in an Age of Escalating Imperial Tensions

CBS senior foreign correspondent Charlie Dâ€™Agataâ€™s contrast of Ukraine, which he described as â€œrelatively civilized, relatively European,â€ with Iraq and Afghanistan, where â€œconflict has been raging for decades,â€ went viral and offended millions around the globe. This dangerous comment was a sobering reminder of the persisting racism, Islamophobia and colonial mentalities still propagated by mainstream media. While people from the Middle East expressed their shock and disappointment at being labeled uncivilized, I want to focus on the â€œrelativelyâ€ part of â€œrelatively civilized, relatively Europeanâ€ and illustrate the danger â€” historical and lingering â€” in concrete, regional, Eastern European terms. Bulgaria provides an illuminating example of a country with inhumane policies for acceptance as â€œfullyâ€ European by a xenophobic, Islamophobic Western Europe.

Since the end of the nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule in 1878, a central component of building what we recognize today as modern Bulgaria was coming to terms with being â€œrelatively civilized, relatively European.â€ According to Bulgarian intellectuals at the time of founding and socialism later (1944-1989), the Ottoman Empire had interrupted Bulgarian â€œnaturalâ€ European cultural development. Thus, cleansing all vestiges of Islam and the Ottoman Empire was vital in affirming Bulgarian national identity as a European country with modern European potential. These ideas led to horrific consequences for the tangible, living vestiges of the Ottoman Empire: my Turkish community.

Bulgarian national identity construction during socialism was based on the â€œTurkish yoke.â€ Historians and media framed the former Ottoman rulers in classic orientalist terms: Muslim, backward and barbaric. Hostile stereotypes were reproduced in many Bulgarian television productions about the history of Bulgarian plight under Ottoman domination. Additionally, the television productions were harnessed to legitimize a forced assimilation campaign that targeted Muslim communities, including my own. Every Turkish and Muslim person in Bulgaria was forced to change their mostly Arabic-origin name to a Bulgarian one. My mother still has the proof of her name-change document, which she had to present at work to be given her salary. Practicing Islam and associated clothing (veils, shalwar) were banned, speaking Turkish was illegal and Prime Minister Todor Zhivkov declared, â€œThere are no Turks in Bulgariaâ€ after the name-changing campaign was complete. In the late 20th century. In Europe.

Following my fatherâ€™s escape to Turkey and a lengthy ordeal with the government, my mother managed to get my brother and I out of Bulgaria shortly before the largest act of ethnic cleansing in Europe since World War II, when 360,000 Turks were expelled from Bulgaria in 1989. Following Bulgariaâ€™s transition to democracy later that year, ethnic minority rights were promised and restored, and many expellees returned. However, as elsewhere, despite a democratically elected government and European Union (EU) membership, ethnic minority rights leave much to be desired in Bulgaria, demonstrating how empty terms such as â€œEuropeanâ€ are. For example, Bulgarian authoritiesâ€™ â€œfailure to tackle entrenched prejudice against asylum seekers, migrants, Muslims and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people is fuelling further violence and discrimination,â€ Amnesty International notes, leading to a â€œclimate of fear.â€

Recently, at the prospect of an onslaught of Ukrainian refugees following the Russian attack on Ukraine, Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov â€” much like Charlie Dâ€™Agata â€” stated that no European country is afraid of the Ukrainian refugees, because Ukrainians are â€œintelligent,â€ â€œeducatedâ€ and â€œEuropean,â€ in contrast to the prior (Syrian) refugee waves of â€œpeople with unclear pasts, who could have been terrorists.â€ This empathy toward Ukrainian refugees is indeed a stark contrast to Bulgarian policies and practices toward Syrian refugees. During the Syrian refugee waves, instead of protecting Syrian refugees, Bulgaria fortified its borders to keep Syrian refugees out of the country. Though overt xenophobia is ostensibly against EU values, a xenophobic, Islamophobic climate reverberated throughout Bulgarian public discourse and, as we witness again, it is ongoing. Indeed, this xenophobic climate is pervasive in the EU more broadly.

Statements such as â€œrelatively civilized, relatively Europeanâ€ only fuel xenophobia and racism in countries described as such, because elites aspire to full Europeanness, at all costs. In our effort to combat xenophobia, racism and Islamophobia, we must remember that terms such as â€œcivilizedâ€ and â€œEuropeanâ€ are nothing but a colonial fantasy peddled as human rights and justice for all.

Edward Said asserted that orientalism says more about â€œourâ€ world than the Orient itself. The reactions to Ukrainian refugees and characterizing countries in Europe as â€œrelatively civilizedâ€ does indeed continue to remind us that the scope, institutions and influence of orientalism are still with us, as they were when Said wrote Orientalism in the 1970s. Yet, I have witnessed the power of the media in toppling elite discourses and promoting intercultural understanding and remain hopeful for the future. Despite the Herculean effort by Bulgarian elites to instill animosity toward Turks and Turkey, Turkish TV series are adored by Bulgarians and have been running on primetime television for more than a decade in Bulgaria. Bulgarian viewers, at first surprised that the Turks in the TV series did not look like the Turks in Bulgarian productions, increasingly recognized the cultural proximity between the two countries and saw Turks for what they are: human beings.

As a former refugee, I can attest: Refugees are in fact human beings â€” human beings seeking refuge from danger. Who would want to leave their place of birth, comfort and community for an entirely new life, unless they didnâ€™t absolutely have to? A Syrian refugee living in Istanbul told me a few years ago that he wished that people would understand that war could happen anywhere. â€œToday itâ€™s us. Tomorrow it might be you,â€ he said. This crystallized for Europeans with Russiaâ€™s attack on Ukraine, expressed with shock and open arms to Ukrainian refugees. This support for â€œrelatively Europeanâ€ refugees is most admirable and welcome. Now, letâ€™s extend this humanity to all refugees and remember that tomorrow it might be us.

6424,UKRAINE WAR: Putin's Latest Brilliant Masterstroke,"Russian strongman Vladimir Putin has removed several top military commanders from their positions due to â€œpoor performancesâ€ in the Ukraine War, according to British intelligence officials on Thursday.

The U.K. Ministry of Defense described â€œa culture of cover-ups and scapegoatingâ€ that might keep more Russian officers â€œdistracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russiaâ€™s operational set-backs.â€

Lt. Gen. Serhiy Kisel, who commanded Russiaâ€™s elite 1st Guards Tank Army, has been suspended for his failure to capture Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city, Kharkiv. Vice Adm. Igor Osipov, who commanded Russiaâ€™s Black Sea Fleet, has also likely been suspended following the sinking of the fleetâ€™s flagship, Moskva, in April. Gen. Valeriy Gerasimov, the Russian militaryâ€™s chief of the general staff, likely remains in his post, but it was unclear whether he retains the confidence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the ministry.

The failure at Kharkiv is telling. Russian troops never managed to take or even surround Ukraineâ€™s second-largest city despite its proximity to the Russian border and Russiaâ€™s military logistics hub at Belgorod. Over the last two weeks, the Ukraine Army has pushed the Russians almost fully out of the Kharkiv Oblast (region), in some locations all the way back to the border.

Russia abandoned the Battle of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, at the end of March. Soldiers removed from fighting there have been reinforcing the effort to take the rest of Ukraineâ€™s eastern Donbas region, according to multiple sources. Seven weeks later, Russia has yet to make much additional progress in Donbas.

Thatâ€™s not to say everything is going swimmingly for Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy described the conditions in the Donbas as â€œhellâ€ and said the industrialized and resource-rich region had been â€œcompletely destroyedâ€ by the fighting.

Down south, after weeks of delays and heavy fighting, Russian forces appear to have almost entirely eliminated Ukrainian resistance at the massive Azovstal plant in Mariupol. The city â€” along with the cash-cow steel plant â€” has been so badly destroyed that Russia announced it will transform it from an industrial area to a resort town.

There are plenty of resort towns on the Black Sea. Massive steel plants are a bit harder to come by. Azovstal had employed more than 12,000 people at the single facility and had been a big earner of foreign currency.

Russia used to be a lot better at the whole spoils of war thing.

On Monday, retired Russian Army Colonel Mikhail Khodaryonok warned â€” on Russian state television, if you can believe that â€” that things â€œwill get worseâ€ for Russia.

He added Russiaâ€™s position on the world stage is no better, claiming the country is in â€œfull geopolitical isolationâ€. He also warned Russia not to engage in conflict with Finland, which has recently announced plans to join NATO. â€œMuch as we would hate to admit this, virtually the entire world is against us,â€ Khodaryonok said.

â€œWe shouldnâ€™t take â€˜information tranquilizers,â€™ because sometimes information is spread about some moral or psychological breakdown of Ukraineâ€™s armed forces, which are allegedly on the verge of some kind of crisis in morale,â€ Khodaryonok said. â€œAll of that, to put mildly, is false.â€

Recommended: Is Elon Musk Trying to Buy Twitter â€” Or Humiliate It?

Two days later, perhaps after a gentle warning, Khodaryonok reversed course with almost comic effect.

â€œWhen a country buys Western-made equipment, sometimes it malfunctions or stops working, right in the middle of the battle,â€ he said Thursday on Russiaâ€™s notoriously monitored state media. â€œOur arms we supply to our buyers are different in their reliability, you get exactly the weapons described.â€

â€œAlex, Iâ€™ll take â€˜Things No One Said About Russian vs. Western Weapons EVERâ€™ for $400.â€

Khodaryonok went on to say that â€œThe Russian Federation is yet to utilize even one-tenth of its military-economic potential.â€ Russia is believed to have sent about 75% of its combat power to Ukraine and lost perhaps a quarter of it to combat, fatigue, and maintenance failures.

Any replacements Russia musters will likely be less well-trained and less well-equipped, simply due to the stresses of war and the bite of sanctions.

Whatâ€™s the big picture?

Though much less effective than advertised, the Russian armed forces can still cause a lot of death and destruction. Manpower and logistical limitations, however, prevent them from advancing very far or in more than one direction at a time. The retreats from Kyiv and Kharkiv are the result of these very real limits.

The Ukraine armed forces have fought beyond most expectations, particularly in their ability to inflict damage on those parts of the Russian military that can afford it the least. Retired Australian Army General Mick Ryan describes how Ukraine has focused on Russiaâ€™s â€œcommunications networks, logistic supply routes, rear areas, artillery and senior commanders in their command postsâ€ to devastating effect.

But Ukraine has yet to demonstrate that it can force the Russian troops out of areas where Moscow chooses to remain strong.

Thatâ€™s a recipe for a long, hard slog that benefits no one and risks escalation to a broader conflict.

I know I keep saying this, but itâ€™s time for the Biden administration to stop yammering about regime change and pressing for the utter humiliation of Russia, and start working hard for a negotiated settlement.

But three months into this stupid war, thereâ€™s zero sign of restraint or wisdom in either Moscow or Washington.",https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2022/05/20/ukraine-war-putin-fires-top-commanders-in-latest-brilliant-masterstroke-n1599447,Anti-Russian
2038,Russia's nuclear threats over Ukraine are keeping StratCom busy,"With Russian rockets pounding Ukrainian cities and President Vladimir Putin brandishing his plutonium saber, you just know the late-night coffee is brewing deep inside U.S. Strategic Commandâ€™s glass tower at Offutt Air Force Base.

Adm. Charles Richard, StratComâ€™s commander and the keeper of the nationâ€™s nuclear keys, implied as much in video-chat testimony to a House Armed Services subcommittee on Tuesday.

â€œDue to the unfolding events over the weekend,â€ Richard said, â€œI felt it prudent to remain at my headquarters here in Omaha.â€

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is more than just the largest land war in Europe since 1945. It also presents the United States with the starkest threat of nuclear conflict since the end of the Cold War, and has thrust Nebraska-based StratCom into an unaccustomed spotlight.

â€œThe men and women of U.S. Strategic Command ... work night and day to deter threats like these,â€ Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer said this week in a speech on the Senate floor. â€œThereâ€™s a reason their motto is â€˜Peace is Our Profession.â€™ â€

Putin has compounded the risk with bare-fanged threats sure to make neck hair stand on end in both Omaha and D.C.

â€œTodayâ€™s Russia remains one of the most powerful nuclear states,â€ Putin said last week. â€œThere should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country.â€

He ratcheted up tensions another notch Sunday when he ordered Russiaâ€™s forces put on a â€œspecial regime of high-alert combatâ€ during a strange meeting where he was photographed sitting at one end of a long conference table while his top military commanders gathered at the other.

So far, the U.S. hasnâ€™t responded in kind.

â€œWe know that the president has not placed U.S. nuclear forces on high alert,â€ said Lana Obradovic, director of the University of Nebraska at Omahaâ€™s Intelligence Community Center of Academic Excellence program. â€œBut I am certain StratCom is observing the situation and working around the clock.â€

In StratComâ€™s cubicles, teams of military and civilian planners earn their pay by envisioning catastrophic threats to the U.S. and its allies, and then drawing up plans to defuse them.

â€œThis is the kind of stuff that they work on â€” numerous reports written, thousands and thousands of hours of research, gaming out different scenarios that the president and his advisers could face,â€ said Tyler White, director of the National Security Program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. â€œYou donâ€™t want two nuclear powers going to war with each other.â€

The fear of just such a war animated StratComâ€™s predecessor at Offutt, the Strategic Air Command, for four decades during the Cold War as the U.S. and the USSR eyed each other with a hostile gaze.

In those days, nuclear-armed missiles and bombers stood poised to fire in both countries. Around the world, two generations grew up under the constant threat of nuclear annihilation.

The threat all but evaporated with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the breakup of the Soviet Union. In 1992 SAC, the nationâ€™s Cold War guardian, stood down and was replaced by StratCom.

The new command took on new tasks including space, missile defense, intelligence collection and communications. But StratComâ€™s public profile faded with the prominence of its signature nuclear mission.

Suddenly, with Putinâ€™s Ukraine incursion, Americans are experiencing a riveting, nuclear-tipped calamity that for many is a brand-new experience.

â€œStratCom is one of the lesser-thought-about (military) commands,â€ White said. â€œNow it kind of takes center stage again because of this crisis.â€

The public may be paying attention to nuclear issues for the first time in a long while, but StratComâ€™s planners have never looked away.

â€œThe strategic deterrence mission is ongoing all the time,â€ said Rick Evans, executive director of the University of Nebraskaâ€™s National Strategic Research Institute, an academic alliance that conducts research for StratCom. â€œThese types of plans are very well-practiced. Weâ€™re very proficient at that.â€

Evans has been in the room to see plenty of them. The retired Air Force major general served in top positions at StratCom near the end of his 35-year military career, including a stint as acting deputy commander. He retired in 2019.

Evans said he would be more worried about Putinâ€™s nuclear noise-making if StratComâ€™s intelligence sources indicated he was taking concrete steps toward a nuclear strike, like loading bombs on aircraft or pulling weapons out of storage.

â€œThis is still a regional conflict,â€ he said. â€œWe have the appropriate forces on status at the right time.â€

People may think StratComâ€™s strategic plans rest on massive retaliation â€” nuking adversaries to kingdom come. And they do have plans for Armageddon.

But Armageddon represents the failure of nuclear deterrence, Evans said. StratComâ€™s modern plans employ non-nuclear, and even non-military strategies to keep confrontations from escalating â€” like diplomacy, information warfare and economic sanctions.

â€œAll these instruments of national power are in play,â€ he said.

And all of them are in use in Ukraine, including by Ukrainians themselves. Militarily they should be no match for the huge Russian army. But President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has united his own people behind him, and inspired NATO and the world to support his cause.

â€œHe has won the information war,â€ White said. â€œThis is a space that Putin is used to winning. And he is being absolutely schooled.â€

The sympathy for Zelenskyy and his fellow Ukrainians has aided President Joe Bidenâ€™s efforts to rally NATO support.

â€œNATO has certainly demonstrated that it is more united, resilient and resolute than ever before,â€ said Obradovic. â€œThe unintended consequence of the Russian aggression was that American leadership and NATO's renewed purpose have now led to an increase in defense spending and added credibility.â€

Obradovic, an associate professor of political science who has worked closely with StratCom, brings a unique personal perspective to a research portfolio that includes U.S. national security policymaking and post-communist transitions.

At age 16, she fled her home in the former Yugoslavia with her mother as the country was engulfed in sectarian violence following the collapse of communist rule. She has witnessed the kind of indiscriminate targeting of civilians now taking place in Ukraine and experienced life as a refugee.

Coincidentally, Obradovic is on a sabbatical in Sarajevo, in her former homeland, recruiting young Bosnian students for a summer program at UNO. In the 1990s, Sarajevo became the battered symbol of the Bosnian war during a four-year siege that killed nearly 14,000 people.

Sarajevens have marched in support of the Ukrainian people, Obradovic said, and feel a special bond to them in their suffering.

â€œThey know a lot about war, perseverance and defiance, which is why so many are horrified by the events in Ukraine,â€ she said in an email. â€œThe hope is that the world has learned its lessons since Bosnia, that democratic nations will protect international norms and rules, and prevent atrocities and attacks â€” particularly those aimed at the civilian population from happening again.â€

Putin has certainly endured setbacks, with his military bogged down in Ukraine, the world nearly united in its disapproval, international sanctions already crippling Russiaâ€™s economy and protesters marching in the streets of his own country.

â€œUkraineâ€™s efforts to frustrate the invasion have surpassed expectations,â€ White said. â€œHe has to feel isolated internationally, and he probably feels isolated internally. His biggest fear is a popular uprising.â€

The growing fear is that, feeling cornered, Putin might unsheathe his nuclear sword. Would he really do it?

â€œThatâ€™s an important question that energizes everybodyâ€™s minds,â€ said Christopher Yeaw, NSRIâ€™s associate executive director for strategic deterrence and nuclear programs. â€œIn Putinâ€™s current state of mind, he is certainly leaning forward.â€

In the nuclear realm, Yeaw said, Putin has a large number of low-yield tactical or â€œbattlefieldâ€ atomic weapons. These are small enough to level a few city blocks, perhaps killing dozens or hundreds of people, instead of destroying an entire city, and killing tens of thousands.

Of course, they would still burn and maim and poison, just on a smaller scale.

â€œThese are nuclear warheads that blur the line between conventional and nuclear,â€ Yeaw said. â€œThey could take out an entire air base with one strike.â€

The U.S. and the USSR both stored up large caches of these â€œbaby nukesâ€ during the Cold War, expecting they might use them should the two sides clash in a European ground war.

Battlefield nuclear weapons werenâ€™t covered by any of the post-Cold War arms agreements. The U.S. got rid of its weapons, seeing no further need for them.

For a time Russia did, too, Yeaw said. But by the 1990s it stopped, after seeing the U.S. become involved in conflicts with Russian allies in the Balkans.

â€œThe Russians made promises that went away,â€ Yeaw said. â€œThe U.S. is outmatched in the European theater probably 20-to-1. In the Pacific theater, we donâ€™t have any.â€

Yeaw helped to write the Pentagonâ€™s 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, which provided for the addition of two new types of tactical nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal: the W-76-2 Trident submarine warhead, which was deployed in 2020, and the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile, which is still on the drawing board.

The W-76-2 is about 5 to 7 kilotons â€” less than 10% as powerful as the W-76 Trident missile it is derived from, and less than half the strength of the bomb that leveled Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War II.

Battlefield nuclear weapons are opposed by arms-control advocates, who believe their lesser firepower compared with larger city-killing weapons might tempt a cornered, desperate leader to use them. Doing so would clearly cross a red line.

â€œAny use of nuclear weapons is going to have strategic implications,â€ Evans said. â€œIf you actually use one of these things, if you break the seal, it opens you up to a whole different variety of outcomes.â€

So â€” would Putin really use one?

â€œThatâ€™s the $60 million question,â€ Yeaw said.

The United States is trying to stay out of a direct confrontation with Russia. Itâ€™s not clear how Biden would respond if Putin detonates a battlefield nuke in Ukraine.

â€œHow do you deal with a country that is willing to use nuclear weapons, in a war that youâ€™re not in?â€ White said. â€œItâ€™s hard to believe thereâ€™s going to be no response.â€

Part of Yeawâ€™s job since joining NSRI is to prepare war games for StratCom planners to play, simulating real-life situations.

In 2019, his team created one and blandly named it the â€œLimited Nuclear Employment War Game.â€ It plays out a conflict between NATO and Russia over Russian expansionism in Ukraine.

He has played it a number of times. So have planners at StratCom.

Yeaw doesnâ€™t want to say exactly how it ends.

â€œWhat could happen is the whole realm of scary possibilities,â€ he said. â€œOnce you start down the path of war, things take on a life of their own.â€

Heâ€™s been thinking about that game in recent weeks.

â€œI hope I donâ€™t watch it on TV,â€ Yeaw said.

One of the key points in any StratCom plan to avert war is to give the adversary a face-saving way to back out, said Michelle Black, deterrence researcher and assistant professor of political science at NSRI.

She, too, has been in the room. Her tour in the Army from 2001-05 included deployments to Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar as a psychological operations specialist. She worked seven years at StratCom in a civilian post as an adversary deterrence analyst. She worked there when Putin seized Crimea in 2014.

â€œSince Crimea, (Ukraine) has been a target of attention. Understanding how things could escalate has been a priority,â€ Black said. â€œI would have confidence in saying that a portion of this has been planned out.â€

She sees Putin as a rational actor.

â€œPutinâ€™s a strategist. He has smart people around him,â€ she said. â€œMaybe Putin's not ready for an off-ramp yet.""

Yeawâ€™s concern is what happens if NATO corners Putin so effectively that the off-ramps are gone.

â€œThereâ€™s a cornered bear thatâ€™s still trying to lash out,â€ Yeaw said. â€œI wouldnâ€™t want to be in front of the bearâ€™s paw.â€

In his testimony this week, StratComâ€™s Adm. Richard worked to reassure jittery members of Congress.

â€œPlease make no mistake,â€ he said, â€œStratComâ€™s forces are ready.â€

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The messages, videos and photos flying across Twitter, Facebook and Telegram far outnumber the airstrikes raining down on Ukraine.

They claim to show Russian fighter jets being shot down or Ukrainians dodging for cover in their own homes.

Some are real, horrifying images of this war. Others had been lurking on the internet for years before Russia launched the largest attack on a European country since World War II.

The invasion of Ukraine is shaping up to be Europeâ€™s first major armed conflict of the social media age, when the small screen of the smartphone is the dominant tool of communication, carrying with it the peril of an instantaneous spread of dangerous, even deadly, disinformation.

TikTok videos, propagandized headlines and tweets pinging out across screens around the world are confusing millions about the reality of how this battle is unfolding on the ground.

Across Telegram and Twitter, Russiaâ€™s attack on Ukraine was both â€œunprovokedâ€ and â€œnecessary,â€ depending on the sender of the message.

â€œThe prayers of the world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,â€ President Joe Biden tweeted Wednesday night to his 40 million followers.

Russian state media, however, echoed Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s comments across its platforms, with RT News blasting to hundreds of thousands of followers on Telegram that the action was â€œnecessary.â€

Over the last few days, Putin and Russian media have ramped up false accusations that Ukrainians are committing genocide, and mischaracterizing the majority of the countryâ€™s population as Nazis, said Bret Schafer, who heads the information manipulation team at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington.

Last week, for example, RTâ€™s news director claimed on live television, without evidence, that Ukrainians might start gassing their own people.

â€œYouâ€™ve really seen this escalation of the narrative that Russia needs to protect from this Nazi mob of genocidal Ukrainians,â€ Schafer said.

As Thursday wore on, the truth became even more difficult for the rest of the world to disentangle from a string of hundreds of misleading tweets, deceptively edited videos and out-of-context photos that emerged after the first shots of war rang out.

One clip, taken from a video game, amassed millions of views as users falsely claimed it depicted real attacks. A video captured by The Associated Press in Libya more than a decade ago was revived across Facebook and Twitter Thursday, with users saying it showed a Russian fighter jet plummeting through gray skies to the ground after being shot down by Ukrainian forces. And some TikTok users wrongly believed they were watching a video of soldiers parachuting into Ukraine after a Russian account posted years-old footage while Russiaâ€™s invasion was underway â€” that didnâ€™t stop the clip from racking up more than 22 million views before the dayâ€™s end.

People who see these videos, photos and claims online are likely to watch them, share them and move on with their day, said John Silva, a senior director of the News Literacy Project, a nonprofit that works to fight misinformation through education.

â€œWe see a paratrooper, heâ€™s speaking Russian, and so we donâ€™t take the time to question it,â€ said Silva. â€œIf we see a piece of information thatâ€™s new to us, we have this compulsion to share it with others.â€

And while some users are unintentionally spreading rumors in hopes of shaping perception of the invasion, others are betting on the idea that they can dupe unwitting social media users into sharing the falsehoods.

â€œWe know disinformation is going to come out of the Russian government,â€ Silva said. â€œThen you also have trolls â€” people who just put things out there to see if they can fool people.â€

People are consuming these misleading claims because they are desperate for information, Schafer of the Alliance for Securing Democracy said.

â€œYou have a huge surge of demand, low supply of credible information, and a lot of sketchy information that fills the void,â€ he added.

That void became larger Thursday as internet outages rolled through several parts of Ukraine, making it even harder for people there to contact relatives or follow the news.

As a surge of people tried to access Telegram, a social media and messaging platform popular in Eastern Europe, the app experienced service interruptions, according to a post from Pavel Durov, one of Telegramâ€™s founders.

Key Russian websites, including the main sites of the Kremlin and military, were also unreachable or slow to load following what appeared to be a retaliatory attack. And U.S. officials blamed Russia for disabling major government websites in Ukraine.

Widespread outages in Kharkiv, Ukraineâ€™s second largest city, and the strategic port of Mariupol were experienced Thursday, said Alp Toker, the founder of NetBlocks, a London-based company that monitors web outages and internet accessibility throughout the world.

While some outages could be caused by shells or airstrikes, others are part of an intentional effort by Russian forces to disrupt communications and cause panic, he said.

â€œBlow by blow, the human impact of being disconnected at a time like this is a terrifying experience,â€ he said. â€œIt makes sense from a tactical view. We know that this is a strategy.â€

8893,Britain bans Russian state TV channel RT,"

CNN

By Mark Thompson, CNN Business

Britain has banned Russian state TV channel RT, saying it was incapable of providing impartial coverage of the war in Ukraine.

UK broadcast media regulator Ofcom said it had been conducting 29 investigations into RTâ€™s coverage of Russiaâ€™s invasion, and had taken into account the channelâ€™s ties with the Russian state and new Russian laws which â€œeffectively criminalizeâ€ any journalism that departs from the Kremlinâ€™s narrative in relation to the war.

â€œFreedom of expression is something we guard fiercely in this country, and the bar for action on broadcasters is rightly set very high,â€ Ofcom CEO Melanie Dawes said in a statement. â€œFollowing an independent regulatory process, we have today found that RT is not fit and proper to hold a license in the UK. As a result we have revoked RTâ€™s UK broadcasting license.â€

The European Union had already banned RT from broadcasting as part of sweeping sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

The measure suspended RTâ€™s broadcasting activities in the European Union, or directed at it, affecting its UK, German, French and Spanish networks. Ofcom confirmed in its statement Friday that the channel was already off air in the United Kingdom because of the EU sanctions.

The Kremlin described Britainâ€™s move as â€œanti-Russian madness.â€

â€œThis is a continuation of the anti-Russian madness that is happening in Europe and the US,â€ Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. â€œThis is another step to grossly restrict freedom of speech, to violate all laws related to the work of the media,â€ he added.

RTâ€™s ability to project President Vladimir Putinâ€™s talking points around the world has been significantly constrained in recent weeks as cable carriers and social media channels dumped the broadcaster.

DirecTV, one of only two major television providers in the United States to carry RT, said earlier this month it was cutting ties with immediate effect. A few days later, RT America decided to cease production and lay off most of its staff.

Ofcomâ€™s move could trigger further retaliation by Russian authorities against British broadcasters such as the BBC. Russian media regulators restricted access to the BBC website earlier this week, having previously taken similar action against its Russian language website.

â€œI think this is only the beginning of the response to the information war unleashed by the West against Russia,â€ Russiaâ€™s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a Telegram post on Wednesday.

RT had broken UK broadcasting rules repeatedly, long before the invasion of Ukraine.

In July 2019, Ofcom fined RT Â£200,000 ($263,000) for repeatedly breaking impartiality rules in its coverage of the Skripal poisonings and the conflict in Syria. It found that RT had failed to maintain â€œdue impartialityâ€ in seven programs that aired in March and April 2018.

The programs were broadcast after the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. UK authorities said they were the victims of an attack conducted by agents of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU.

RT said Friday that the UK ban was â€œpolitical.â€

â€œFor many years in the UK they have been looking for a formal reason to close RT, but they have tried to maintain the appearance of freedom of speech. Now the masks are off,â€ the channel said in a statement on its Telegram account.

7088,Blinken says Russiaâ€™s â€˜playbookâ€™ for an invasion of Ukraine is moving forward but war can still be averted,"By Jeremy Herb, CNN

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Russiaâ€™s â€œplaybookâ€ for an invasion of Ukraine is moving forward, though he said there still is a chance for diplomacy to avert a war.

â€œAs weâ€™ve described it, everything leading up to the actual invasion appears to be taking place,â€ Blinken said on CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Unionâ€ on Sunday.

Ukraineâ€™s defense ministry reported more than 100 ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine on Saturday and said that shelling continued into Sunday, while Russian troops remain in Belarus to continue military exercises that were supposed to have concluded.

Blinken told CNNâ€™s Dana Bash he was concerned that the extension of the exercises was another sign that Russia was setting the stage to invade, following â€œfalse-flagâ€ operations this week and the accumulation of more than 150,000 Russian forces along Ukraineâ€™s border.

â€œNow theyâ€™re justifying the continuation of â€˜exercisesâ€™ that they said would end now, the continuation indefinitely of those quote-unquote exercises on the situation in eastern Ukraine â€” a situation that they created by continuing to ramp up tensions,â€ Blinken said.

Still, Blinken said the US would continue to try to find a last-ditch diplomatic path. He said President Joe Biden is willing to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin â€œat any time, in any formatâ€ if it will help prevent a war, saying the Biden administration will continue to take whatever steps it can to try to convince Moscow not to invade Ukraine.

â€œWe believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,â€ Blinken said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in Germany on Saturday, where he met with Vice President Kamala Harris at the Munich Security Conference. Zelensky said that he was urging the US and Europe not to wait to put in place sanctions against Russia, arguing that they wouldnâ€™t help Ukraine if they only were invoked after an invasion had already begun.

Blinken said on Sunday that the US did not want to unveil the sanctions ahead of time because that would â€œallow Russia to try and plan against them.â€

â€œThe purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war,â€ he said. â€œAs soon as you trigger them, that deterrent is gone and until the last minute, as long as we can try to bring a deterrent effect to this, weâ€™re going to try to do that.â€

Blinken said that if Putin goes forward with an invasion, the US and NATO have been clear theyâ€™re â€œgoing to come down on him and Russia very, very hard.â€

Asked if Putin could be bluffing, Blinken said, â€œThereâ€™s always a chance, but every indication that weâ€™ve seen, every move that heâ€™s made, that has followed the play that we laid out for the world to see in front of the United Nations Security Council, he is following the script almost to the letter.â€

â€œEverything weâ€™re seeing suggests that this is dead serious, that we are on the brink of an invasion,â€ he added.

But Putin still has options on the table if he chooses to take a diplomatic off-ramp to the tensions, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Sunday.

â€œWe have made serious proposals and talked about changing, for instance, the scope and scale of some of our exercises in Europe, being willing to talk about offensive missile capabilities in Europe. We have certainly put forward other proposals to try to convince Mr. Putin â€¦ that weâ€™re serious,â€ Kirby told Fox.

He also made clear the issue of Ukraineâ€™s membership in NATO, however, is â€œan issue for Ukraine and for NATO.â€

â€œThat is not something that Mr. Putin can simply institute a veto over or decide for himself,â€ he said.

And the US would not recognize the ceding of Crimea or any other territory in Eastern Ukraine to Russia as a way to avoid war, Blinken told CBSâ€™ Margaret Brennan Sunday.

â€œNo,â€ the secretary said when asked on â€œFace the Nationâ€ if the US would use that tactic as a diplomatic way to avoid a larger war.

Meanwhile, President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ of Finland, which shares a border with Russia, told Bash in a separate interview Sunday that Putin has â€œbehaved in a way which is very difficult to predictâ€.

â€œItâ€™s very difficult to say and define what the other person actually, deep down, is. But so far, I would say that he has behaved in a way which is very difficult to predict but that might be also intentional, namely to behave in that way, because that brings confusion to surroundings,â€ NiinistÃ¶ said.

Blinken is scheduled to meet later this week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Europe, in what would be another round of diplomatic talks that have gone on for weeks as Russiaâ€™s troops have continue to mass on Ukraineâ€™s border. But Blinken said the meeting would be called off in the event of an invasion.

â€œIt all depends on what Russia does in the coming days,â€ he said. â€œIf it doesnâ€™t invade, Iâ€™ll be there.â€

3573,Russia: Now witness the firepower of this fully ARMED and OPERATIONAL hypersonic missile system,"Is Vladimir Putin literally breaking out the big guns in an effort to finally destroy the resistance in Ukraine? That seems to be the implication if an announcement from the Russian army is to be believed. While not technically the â€œbiggest gunsâ€ they have in their arsenal, one of Russiaâ€™s generals claimed that they used one of their new Kinzhal hypersonic aeroballistic missiles to destroy an underground ammunition depot near the Polish border this morning. Weâ€™ve long since passed the point where you can take any statements made by Russian officials at face value, but we do know that Moscow has successfully tested their hypersonic weapons before. This would be the first use of such a missile in actual combat, however. (NBC News)

Russiaâ€™s military said Saturday it had used a hypersonic missile in combat for the first time to destroy an ammunition depot in Ukraineâ€™s west. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the â€œKinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles,â€ was deployed Friday, in a video posted on Russian state media RIAâ€™s Telegram channel. He added that it â€œdestroyed a large underground warehouseâ€ containing â€œmissiles and aviation ammunitionâ€ in the village of Delyatyn, a small community around 380 miles west of Ukraineâ€™s capital Kyiv. NBC News was not able to verify his claims, which came after Ukraineâ€™s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for talks with Moscow to stop its invasion and â€œrestore territorial integrity and justice to Ukraine,â€ in a video message released late Friday.

As noted in the article, NBC was unable to verify that an ammunition depot had actually been destroyed and, if so, a hypersonic missile was used to do it. I would imagine that American intelligence officials have been watching the action closely via satellite surveillance systems and they should be able to confirm or deny the story soon enough.

Would Russia lie about something like this? Thatâ€™s probably a silly question at this point. Theyâ€™ve been lying through their teeth about almost every aspect of the invasion of Ukraine since well before it even began. But the use of these advanced weapons systems, or even the threat of using them, might be Putinâ€™s way of trying to intimidate the Ukrainian resistance.

If so, that might be some sort of compromise measure in terms of a question that we looked at here recently. Some analysts have grown concerned that Putin might deploy a tactical nuclear weapon if he grows too frustrated with his lack of progress in sacking Ukraine. Perhaps thatâ€™s still a bridge too far, but heâ€™s thinking that the new hypersonic missiles might send the same message?

In any event, Mad Vlad has more bad news to be frustrated by as of this morning. Ukraine is claiming to have killed another Russian general in combat.

Russian Lieutenant-General Andrei Mordvichev was killed during fighting, Ukraineâ€™s armed forces said Saturday in a statement on its Facebook page. It said Mordvichev â€œthe commander of the 8th All-Military Army of the Southern Military District of the Armed Forces,â€ was killed â€œas a result of fire damage.â€

That headline hasnâ€™t been confirmed yet either, and Ukraine has been known to pad some of their numbers to emphasize the effectiveness of their resistance. But if it turns out to be true, Russia has lost something in the range of a half-dozen of their most senior military officers in less than a month. Thatâ€™s a really curious development because the top brass tends to command from the rear in most war scenarios. So either they have advanced too quickly without clearing the resistance and allowed the Ukrainians to get behind them in force or their soldiers are so disorganized and bad at this that the generals feel compelled to go to the front lines and direct the action themselves. Either way, itâ€™s not a positive development for the vaunted Russian army.",https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2022/03/19/russia-now-witness-the-firepower-of-this-fully-armed-and-operational-hypersonic-missile-system-n456465,Anti-Russian
2867,Russia's top oligarch to Putin: Never go the full Maduro ... or Lenin,"A gutsy move by Russiaâ€™s wealthiest oligarch, who probably should make sure all of his upper-story windows are solidly reinforced after this. The first signs of a public split between Vladimir Putin and his big-money support edged out into the open today. Yesterday, the Russian tyrant threatened massive expropriations for Western firms that bail out of Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, a move that comes straight out of Russiaâ€™s Communist past:

President Vladimir Putin had promised a response. Speaking Thursday at a meeting with government officials, he backed a plan to introduce â€œexternal managementâ€ of foreign companies leaving Russia. â€œWe need to act decisively with those [companies] who are going to close their production,â€ Putin said according to a video posted by the Kremlin and aired on state media. â€œIt is necessary, then â€¦ to introduce external management and then transfer these enterprises to those who want to work,â€ he added. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said earlier that legislation had been drafted. â€œIf foreign owners close the company unreasonably, then in such cases the government proposes to introduce external administration. Depending on the decision of the owner, it will determine the future fate of the enterprise,â€ Mishustin said, according to the Kremlin.

â€œExternal managementâ€ means outright seizure through expropriation. Socialist regimes almost always play this card when industrial owners refuse to play ball with their collectivist policies, if not immediately at the start of la revolucion. Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro used expropriation in Venezuela in the oil industry, which had been at one time the backbone of prosperity in the country. After kicking out the oil companies and seizing their assets, the normal Hayekian sequence rapidly followed, as it did in other industries where expropriations took place.

In fact, the Soviet Union did the same thing in 1917, with disastrous effect, as Jim Geraghty reminds us today:

Our study shows that until the year of the 1917, Revolution Russiaâ€™s economy was declining, but by no more than any other continental power. While wartime economic trends shed some light on the causes of the Russian Revolution, they certainly do not support an economically deterministic story; if anything, our account leaves more room for political agency than previous studies. In the two years following the Revolution, there was an economic catastrophe. By 1919, average incomes in Soviet Russia had fallen to less than 600 international dollars at 1990 prices. Less than half that of 1913, this level is experienced today only in the very poorest countries of the world and had not been seen in Eastern Europe since the 17th century (Maddison 2001). Worse was to come. After a run of disastrous harvests, famine conditions began to appear in the summer of 1920 (in some regions perhaps as early as 1919). In Petrograd in the spring of 1919, an average workerâ€™s daily intake was below 1,600 calories, about half the level before the war. Spreading hunger coincided with a wave of deaths from typhus, typhoid, dysentery and cholera. In 1921, the grain harvest collapsed further, particularly in the southern and eastern grain-farming regions. More than five million people may have died prematurely at this time from hunger and disease.

That brings us to Vladimir Potanin, Russiaâ€™s wealthiest oligarch with over $22 billion in assets even after the sanctions collapsed Russiaâ€™s stock market and ruble. Potanin warned that Putinâ€™s plan to expropriate these assets would preclude any return of Western capital to Russia for a generation, a fate that Potanin doesnâ€™t think is necessarily set. Pursuing this path would bring Russia all the way back to Lenin, and Potanin warns that Russians wonâ€™t stand for that:

â€œFirstly, it would take us back a hundred years, to 1917, and the consequences of such a step â€” global distrust of Russia on the part of investors â€” we would experience for many decades,â€ he said in a message posted on Norilsk Nickelâ€™s Telegram account on Thursday. â€œSecondly, the decision of many companies to suspend operations in Russia is, I would say, somewhat emotional in nature and may have been taken as a result of unprecedented pressure on them from public opinion abroad. So most likely they will come back. And personally, I would keep such an opportunity for them,â€ he added. â€¦ Potanin said it wasnâ€™t particularly expedient to talk about nationalizing Western assets, but the Kremlinâ€™s proposal could allow â€œowners to keep property, and companies to avoid collapse, continue to produce products and pay money to employees.â€ â€œI understand that in light of the economic restrictions directed against Russia, there may be an understandable desire to act symmetrically,â€ he wrote. â€œBut on the example of Western countries, we see that the economies of these countries suffer from the imposition of sanctions against Russia. We must be wiser and avoid a scenario where retaliatory sanctions hit ourselves.â€

Thatâ€™s a gentle nudge toward Putin to consider the backfire potential long-term of his consequences. If Putin still needs to be reminded of that necessity after watching his Ukraine adventure blow up in his face, it seems doubtful that Putin will be encouraged to moderate his economic response to the financial lockout from the West. Putin justifies his power by acting muscularly, not intellectually, an impulse that likely has increased in Putin the more it becomes apparent that his military is actually a paper tiger when it comes to conventional forces. That makes this rare dissent from the ruling oligarchical class especially dangerous to Potanin.

It might be even more dangerous to Putin, however. It looks as though he might have exhausted his support from the oligarchical class, whose corruption has deep tentacles in Putinâ€™s government. Putinâ€™s not the only dangerous man at that level in Russia, and the question may arise as to whether the oligarchs might start looking for another option if Putin keeps making matters worse. Potanin had better watch his back, but maybe Putin should start worrying too â€” especially when Potanin seems to feel comfortable enough to publicly rebuke Tsar Vlad.",https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2022/03/11/russias-top-oligarch-to-putin-never-go-the-full-maduro-or-lenin-n454676,Anti-Russian
9001,WHO Chief: Worldâ€™s worst health crisis is in Ethiopia,"WHO Chief: Worldâ€™s worst health crisis is in Ethiopia

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the situation in Tigray from where he hails was â€œcatastrophic.â€

Loading the player...

As much of the worldâ€™s attention is focused on the bloodshed in Ukraine, the head of the World Health Organization said Wednesday thereâ€™s â€nowhere on earth where the health of millions of people is more under threatâ€ than Ethiopiaâ€™s Tigray region.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the situation in Tigray from where he hails was â€œcatastrophic,â€ saying the region had been â€œsealed off from the outside worldâ€ for about 500 days.

In this Jan. 30, 2020, file photo, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), talks to the media at the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. (Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone via AP, File)

â€œNo food aid has been delivered since the middle of December,â€ Tedros told a press briefing, adding that about three quarters of health facilities assessed by WHO in the region had been destroyed. He said there was no treatment for about 40,000 people with HIV in the region.

â€œYes, Iâ€™m from Tigray and this crisis affects me, my family and my friends very personally,â€ Tedros said. â€œBut I, the director general of WHO, I have a duty to protect and promote health wherever itâ€™s under threat,â€ he said. â€œAnd there is nowhere on earth where the health of millions of people is more under threat than Tigray.â€

Tedros said the U.N. health agency had now documented 43 attacks on health care workers and facilities in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began last month.

WHO has now opened supply lines to many cities in Ukraine, but some access challenges remained. The agency continued to call for attacks on health workers and facilities to stop.

For more than a year, a de facto blockade has deprived 7 million people in #Tigray of urgently needed health care & access to food & people are dying. We call on #Ethiopia & #Eritrea to guarantee immediate, safe access & work for peace. Life is precious â€“ everywhere. #EndTheSiege pic.twitter.com/PzAPTeNCK8 â€” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) March 9, 2022

But Tedros said the crisis in Ukraine was â€œfar from the only crisis to which WHO is responding,â€ citing ongoing problems in Yemen, Syria and Ethiopia.

Earlier this year, the government of Ethiopia sent a letter to the World Health Organization, accusing Tedros of â€œmisconductâ€ after his sharp criticism of the war and humanitarian crisis in the country.

4159,Kremlin calls Bidenâ€™s Putin statement â€˜alarmingâ€™,"The Kremlin on Monday said President Bidenâ€™s comment this weekend seemingly suggesting that Russian President Vladimir Putin should be removed was â€œalarming.â€

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters â€œthis is a statement that is certainly alarming,â€ and said Moscow will â€œcontinue to trackâ€ statements from the U.S. president, Reuters reported.

At the end of a speech in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday, Biden said, â€œfor Godâ€™s sake, this man cannot remain in power,â€ which was widely interpreted as meaning Putin should be removed from his position atop Russiaâ€™s government.

However, the White House tried to walk back the comment, claiming that Biden was referring to Putin exercising power outside of Russia, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken affirmed that the U.S. has no policy for regime change in Moscow.

â€œThe presidentâ€™s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putinâ€™s power in Russia, or regime change,â€ a White House official said in a statement.

Peskov told the newswire Sunday that itâ€™s â€œnot for Biden to decideâ€ whether Putin should remain in power, adding â€œThe president of Russia is elected by Russians.â€ The Russian leader has been elected to four presidential terms over the past two decades and has been president of Russia since 2012.

â€œThis speech â€” and the passages which concern Russia â€” is astounding, to use polite words,â€ Peskov added. â€œHe doesnâ€™t understand that the world is not limited to the United States and most of Europe.â€

The ad-libbed remark came at the end of a 27-minute speech in Warsaw towards the end of Bidenâ€™s trip to Europe, which focused on Russiaâ€™s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Last week, Russia said it summoned the U.S. ambassador to Moscow for a meeting to provide him a â€œnote of protestâ€ over Biden calling Putin a war criminal.

The tough statement from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned that relations between Moscow and the U.S. could be completely severed because of Bidenâ€™s remarks and steps by the U.S. government to punish Russia over its invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

â€œIt is emphasized that such statements by the American President, unworthy of a statesman of such a high rank, put Russian-American relations on the verge of breaking,â€ the statement read.",https://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/599994-kremlin-calls-biden-putin-statement-alarming,Neutral
1158,Hundreds arrested as shocked Russians protest Ukraine attack,"MOSCOW (AP) â€” Shocked Russians turned out by the thousands Thursday to decry their country's invasion of Ukraine as emotional calls for protests grew on social media. Some 1,745 people in 54 Russian cities were detained, at least 957 of them in Moscow.

Hundreds of posts came pouring in condemning Moscow's most aggressive actions since the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Vladimir Putin called the attack a ""special military operation"" to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine from ""genocide"" â€” a false claim the U.S. had predicted would be a pretext for invasion, and which many Russians roundly rejected.

Tatyana Usmanova, an opposition activist in Moscow, wrote on Facebook that she thought she was dreaming when she awoke at 5:30 a.m. to the news, which she called ""a disgrace that will be forever with us now.""

""I want to ask Ukrainians for forgiveness. We didn't vote for those who unleashed the war,"" she said.

As sirens blasted in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and large explosions were heard there and in other cities, Russians were signing open letters and online petitions demanding the Kremlin halt the assault, which the Ukrainian health minister said had killed at least 57 Ukrainians and wounded dozens more.

""Public opinion is in shock, people are in shock,"" political analyst Abbas Gallyamov told The Associated Press.

One petition, started by a prominent human rights advocate, Lev Ponomavyov, garnered over 150,000 signatures within several hours and more than 330,000 by the end of the day. More than 250 journalists put their names on an open letter decrying the aggression. Another one was signed by some 250 scientists, while 194 municipal council members in Moscow and other cities signed a third.

""I'm worried about the people very much, I'm worried to tears,"" said Zoya Vorobey, a resident of Korolyov, a town outside Moscow, her voice cracking. ""I've been watching television since this morning, every minute, to see if anything changes. Unfortunately, nothing.""

Several Russian celebrities and public figures, including some working for state TV, spoke out against the attack. Yelena Kovalskaya, director of a state-funded Moscow theater, announced on Facebook she was quitting her job, saying ""it's impossible to work for a killer and get paid by him.""

""I know that right now many of you feel desperation, helplessness, shame over Vladimir Putin's attack on the friendly nation of Ukraine. But I urge you not to despair,"" human rights activist Marina Litvinovich said in a video statement on Facebook, calling for mass protests Thursday evening.

""We, the Russian people, are against the war Putin has unleashed. We don't support this war, it is being waged not on our behalf,"" Litvinovich said.

But the authorities were having none of that.

In Moscow and other cities, they moved swiftly to crack down on critical voices. Litvinovich was detained outside of her residence shortly after posting the protest call. OVD-Info, a rights group that tracks political arrests, reported that 1,745 people in 54 cities had been detained by Thursday evening, at least 957 of them in Moscow.

Russia's Investigative Committee issued a warning Thursday afternoon reminding Russians that unauthorized protests are against the law.

Roskomnadzor, state communications and media watchdog, demanded that Russian media use ""information and data they get only from official Russian sources."" Some media reported that employees of certain state-funded companies were instructed not to comment publicly on the events in Ukraine.

Human rights advocates warned of a new wave of repression on dissent.

""There will be new (criminal) cases involving subverters, spies, treason, prosecution for antiwar protests, there will be detentions of journalists and bloggers, those who authored critical posts on social media, bans on investigations of the situation in the army and so on,"" prominent human rights advocate Pavel Chikov wrote on Facebook.

""It is hard to say how big this new wave will be, given that everything has been suppressed already.""

Despite the pressure from the authorities, more than 1,000 people gathered in the center of Moscow Thursday evening, chanting ""No to war!"" as passing cars honked their horns.

Hundreds also took to the streets in St. Petersburg and dozens in Yekaterinburg.

""This is the most shameful and terrible day in my life. I even was not able to go to work. My country is an aggressor. I hate Putin. What else should be done to make people open their eyes?"" Yekaterina Kuznetsova, 40-year-old engineer who joined the demonstration in St. Petersburg, told the AP.

Russia's official line in the meantime remained intransigent. Speaker of the upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko charged that those who spoke out against the attack were only caring about their ""momentary problems.""

State TV painted the attack in line with what Putin said in his televised address announcing it.

Russia 1 TV host Olga Skabeyeva called it an effort ""to protect people in Donbas from a Nazi regime"" and said it was ""without exaggeration, a crucial junction in history.""

Outside the city-council offices in Kyivâ€™s Obolon district, Andriy Biletsky was about to give a speech. It was a spring day in 2019, and volunteers from Biletskyâ€™s far-right group, the Azov movement, were idling in the sunshine next to the gloomy Soviet-era building, while others milled about in the shade of the birch and linden trees of a nearby park, almost outnumbering the audience members. The volunteers wore tight-fitting T-shirts and heavy military boots, and were ready to record the proceedings with cell phones and camcorders. The spectators, mostly pensioners, clutched plastic shopping bags and gossiped among themselves.

Azov was established in 2014 as a volunteer militia, and was lauded for its heroic intervention in Ukraineâ€™s grueling campaign against Russian-backed separatists in the east. Since those early victories, however, Azov has expanded its scope, managing to integrate itself into the military, the police, and other structures of the Ukrainian state. It established its own political party, the National Corps. Biletsky, who commanded Azovâ€™s military forces against Russia, is the partyâ€™s leader.

There was a flurry of activity, gray heads turning and phones held aloft, as Biletskyâ€”a burly forty-year-old sporting a neatly groomed beard and a tight fadeâ€”entered the scene. A small crowd of babushkas with henna-dyed hair and young people in combat gear clustered around him as he began to speak. He railed against the traitors and crooks who dominate Ukrainian politics, and boasted of Azovâ€™s efforts to offer IT and English lessons to the elderly and unemployed. The crowd applauded. â€œIâ€™m so glad you are here,â€ cried one old woman when Biletsky opened the floor for questions. â€œEveryone says the nationalists are Nazis, but really you are patriots.â€ The audience applauded again as Biletskyâ€™s tattooed, black-clad entourage scanned the crowd for potential hecklers.

One respectably dressed middle-aged man carrying groceries asked Biletsky why he hadnâ€™t deployed his regiment to deal with the crooks in parliament. Biletsky sidestepped the question, reminding the crowd instead of the importance of voting. When the Q and A ended, I pushed myself forward and managed to shake Biletskyâ€™s hand. I reminded him that we had an interview scheduled for the next day. â€œWhat do you want to ask me about?â€ he said. â€œFascism?â€ Yes, I replied. He stared at me coldly for a moment and then laughed. â€œOf course, of course,â€ he said, â€œI have nothing to hide.â€

The next morning, his assistant canceled the interview.

Ukraine is among the poorest countries in Europe and the closest thing the continent has to a failing state. It is mired in a smoldering conflict with Russian-backed separatists in its eastern provinces, and its state institutions have been almost entirely captured by competing oligarchs. Corruption pervades almost every level of government. Outside Kyivâ€™s metro stations, elderly women in head scarves and bedraggled war veterans beg for change, while nearby the streets are lined with luxury shops and petty gangsters run red lights in black SUVs without fear of rebuke. Millions have emigrated to Poland or Russia for work. The capital has the uncanny feel, at times, of a postmodern Weimar, where Instagram influencers brunch in cafÃ©s tricked out in the international hipster style opposite billboards adorned with the faces of Ukraineâ€™s martyrs in the war against Russia.

But perhaps Ukraineâ€™s clearest departure from the standard model of European liberalism is its proliferation of armed far-right factions, considered by analysts and ordinary Ukrainians alike to be the secretly funded private armies of the elite oligarch class. They fought in the trenches outside Donetsk and now patrol city streets, enforcing a particular vision of order with the blessing of overstretched and underfunded police departments. In some regions, they serve as official election monitors.

Recruitment posters for these militias can be found across Kyiv, calling on disenchanted veterans and disaffected youths to join them in their mission to remake the world by crushing liberalism. To their supporters, these groups are enforcers of the popular will, defenders of the nation against Russian encroachment from the East and liberal values from the West. To others, especially Ukraineâ€™s Western-funded NGOs, increasingly isolated outposts of liberal order, they pose a serious and growing challenge to Ukraineâ€™s social harmony, and, ultimately, to the state itself.

The most powerful and ambitious of these militias is Azov. Like many of the countryâ€™s armed far-right groups, it was founded during the 2014 revolution, when the Moscow-friendly autocrat Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in bloody clashes around Kyivâ€™s central square, Maidan Nezalezhnosti. More than one hundred protesters were killed in the city, mostly by snipers from the elite Berkut police force, before Yanukovych was overthrown and forced to flee to Russia. Amid the chaos, former members of Patriot of Ukraine, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group, established Azov. The militia first fought in the capital, then aided the military in battles against Russian-backed separatist forces, including the reconquest of the city of Mariupol. In November 2014, Azov was officially integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine, with its own armored units and artillery battery. Since then, it has built a wide-ranging infrastructure of civil and military groupsâ€”including the National Militia, an auxiliary police forceâ€”and spawned a variety of summer camps, training centers, and veteransâ€™ programs. In 2016, Biletsky launched the National Corps. While they have thus far polled at around 1 percent, their failure to generate electoral enthusiasm belies their growing presence both on the streets and within the organs of the state.

This spring, as the novel coronavirus triggered an economic crisis across Europe, Azov capitalized on the uncertainty by pumping out a stream of social-media propaganda that highlighted its humanitarian efforts targeting poor Ukrainians. Azov press releases showed masked volunteers disinfecting trams and common spaces in apartment buildings, handing out packages of food to families and retirees under quarantine, and delivering surgical masks to underfunded clinics and hospitals in neglected provincial towns. â€œDuring this time, our Volunteers already know better than social services who really needs help,â€ claimed one post.

Volunteers are not shown on TV channels, but activists do their job every day. We help those who really need it. Who needed it before quarantine, and became even more vulnerable during quarantine.

National Corps members repaired crumbling orphanages, sewed face masks, and plastered walls with advice on hygiene and social distancingâ€”making a show of performing basic services the Ukrainian state was failing to provide. At the bottom of each press release was a phone number and the exhortation join us! together we will overcome all difficulties!

Ukraineâ€™s complex ecosystem of far-right militias and activist groups is populated by many other organizations that, while less influential than Azov, still play a major role in public life. A variety of themâ€”including Tradition and Order, Katechon, Freikorps, Sokil, and Karpatska Sichâ€”appear at demonstrations with Azov, though their branding differs. Some are more overtly Christian in their imagery; some tend toward neo-paganism; others are more openly fascist. The groups promote one anotherâ€™s posts on social media, especially on the Telegram channels used for organizing, indicating that some share members with Azov and thus may act as front organizations for deniable activity, according to Oksana Pokalchuk, the director of Amnesty International Ukraine. More often than not, however, the groups are committed rivals, competing for the largesse of the Ukrainian state and primacy in the countryâ€™s increasingly heated street politics.

Shortly before Biletsky opted to cancel our interview, I sat in a bright, whitewashed-brick cafÃ© in a gentrifying district of Kyiv with Julian Kondur, a young Roma activist. The previous year, he told me, the cityâ€™s Roma population had been the victims of what he called a â€œpogromâ€ at the hands of C14, one of Azovâ€™s smaller far-right competitors. In April 2018, C14 members burned down a Roma encampment in Kyivâ€™s Lysa Hora park. Kondurâ€™s Roma-rights organization had asked the police for protection, but according to Kondur, officers turned a blind eye when C14 returned the next morning to attack the remaining Roma with pepper spray. (The Kyiv police claim they were unaware that the second attack was taking place.) The militia published photographs on its Facebook page glorifying the campâ€™s destruction. â€œThese groups donâ€™t fight at war, they fight here,â€ Kondur told me. â€œTo prove that they are also heroes they find an easy target. And Roma were the easy target.â€

I arranged to meet Evgen Karas, C14â€™s leader, in one of its officesâ€”a windowless stone cellar near the Arsenalna metro station. It comprised a cramped office and kitchen area, as well as a hall where C14â€™s government-funded NGO hosts lectures and workshops for the capitalâ€™s youth. Karas, his head shaved, arrived half an hour late, locked in conversation with a few young women. Dressed sharply but casually, like the CEO of a tech startup, he settled into the chair opposite me, next to a giant flatscreen television that had been playing Ukrainian music videos. Karas spoke in a rapid, stream-of-consciousness style, defending the valuable role his group played in policing Kyiv, and then expounding a bizarre, unproven claim that Kyivâ€™s police force was engaged in a massive plot to murder elderly and vulnerable people living alone in the city center, bury them in secret graves, and steal their apartments.

When I asked Karas about the Lysa Hora incident, he claimed that the Roma burned down their own encampment, though he admitted that posting photographs of the burning tents on Facebook was probably a misstep. He insisted that C14â€™s role was something akin to Batmanâ€™s in Gotham City: ensuring justice for a desperate, neglected populace.

Karas gave an account of what he described as a typical scenario: First, one of the few good cops, hamstrung by the corruption of his superiors and the legal system, calls him asking for help closing down an illegal bar selling alcohol to children, or chasing drug dealers off the streets. Then C14â€™s foot soldiers arrest the culprits, handing them over to the police and sitting in on the resulting trials in a blaze of publicity that, Karas assured me, had brought positive results. His men, he told me, clamp down on petty crime and antisocial behaviorâ€”things that the countryâ€™s police are incapable of controlling. â€œGeneral crime, like robbers, thieves, people who have stolen cars or who are drunk driving, or someone who raped his wifeâ€”very often we can do it because we have many on patrol,â€ he said. He noted that many C14 members also belong to the Municipal Guard, an auxiliary police militia created by Kyivâ€™s mayor, the three-time world champion heavyweight boxer Vitali Klitschko. With six hundred members, many of them military veterans or C14 fighters from the front lines, the Municipal Guard took part in the Lysa Hora incident alongside C14 and was responsible for enforcing Kyivâ€™s quarantine measures last year.

According to Karas, C14â€™s effectiveness at maintaining order had translated into some success at the ballot box, at least at the local level, where several members have won elected office. Karas himself serves as a member of the Civil Oversight Council at the National Anti-Corruption Bureau. â€œI was elected,â€ he emphasized, making a pointed distinction between his group and Azov, whose success he claims is unfairly derived from the patronage of the countryâ€™s interior minister, the powerful oligarch Arsen Avakov. Karas acknowledged a rumor linking his organization to the director of the countryâ€™s Security Service, but dismissed it as hearsay. All C14 receives from the state, he said, is funding from the Ministry for Veteran Affairs for rehabilitating soldiers, plus some money from the Ministry of Culture for education, and resources for training journalists in â€œhow to deal with and resist Russian propaganda.â€ For Karas, the problem isnâ€™t that far-right groups are getting government funding but that Azov dominates the scene, hoovering up patronage and outcompeting smaller rivals.

On a side street near Maidan Nezalezhnosti, just a few steps from Kyivâ€™s showpiece McDonaldâ€™s, is Cossack House, one of Azovâ€™s administrative centers. Before the revolution, Cossack House provided lodging for military personnel, but when the fighting in the square began, Azov took control, transforming the building into a recruiting center, field hospital, and morgue. They now rent the building from the Ministry of Defense. Behind steel double doors, Cossack House is home to a free gym for potential recruits, as well as offices, lecture halls, and a film club. The buildingâ€™s gray neoclassical corridors display shrines to the groupâ€™s martyred dead, as well as glossy leaflets promoting their summer camps, funded by the Ministry of Culture, at which children receive patriotic education and weapons training.

I had ventured to Cossack House to meet with Ihor Mikhailenko, the commander of Kyivâ€™s National Militia, who, like many senior Azov figures, is a former member of the neo-Nazi Patriot of Ukraine movement. Although Azov does not formally subscribe to National Socialism, members are known to tattoo themselves with Nazi imagery and fly the swastika flag over their fortifications in the east, in what is either a genuine display of ideological loyalty, an effort to troll their Russian enemies, or both. Ukraineâ€™s bloody twentieth-century history creates a certain confusion, as so many symbols of Ukrainian nationalism and the struggle for independence against the Soviet Union are inextricably linked to those who collaborated with the invading Nazi forces against Stalin, a moral and political ambiguity that groups such as Azov exploit to the furthest possible limit. Azovâ€™s official logo combines the Wolfsangel rune of the â€œDas Reichâ€ division of the Waffen-SS with the Black Sun symbol, first employed by SS commander Heinrich Himmler at Wewelsburg Castle in Germany. The groupâ€™s slick propaganda videos feature young recruits with shaved heads and beards marching in torchlit neo-pagan ceremonies behind a Black Sun shieldâ€”imagery as inspiring to disaffected young Ukrainian men as it is discomfiting to the countryâ€™s Western backers.

Buzzed into Cossack House by the gatekeeper manning its CCTV cameras, I climbed a curving tsarist-era staircase into an empty lecture room, where school desks and chairs stood stacked against the walls, to wait for Mikhailenko. He arrived flanked by a burly retinue, and exuded an air of barely restrained impatience at being interviewed. â€œWe donâ€™t have a definite field of activity,â€ he said of the National Militiaâ€™s policing role. â€œWe are engaged in a very large range of preventive acts of law enforcement in the community, as civilians who are helping law enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis.â€ Mikhailenko had played a central role in Azovâ€™s formation as a combat unit, he told me, and he viewed the regiment as his child. â€œThen I switched to civilian life and saw the problems there,â€ he said. â€œI realized that it was necessary to act somehow, to change the order on the streets.â€

Human-rights groups allege that the National Militiaâ€™s public presence is expressly designed to discourage liberal protest and intimidate civil society, charges Mikhailenko denies. â€œThere are no cases where we have put pressure on activists, or any other kind of illegal activity,â€ he told me. â€œWe are not involved in illicit activities, and all our actions stem from the legislation of Ukraine, in accordance with the law.â€ He claims the National Militia is a solution to the failings of the stateâ€”particularly the under-recruitment of policeâ€”which has led to rising crime rates, creating in some areas of Ukrainian cities an anarchic atmosphere of impunity, in which drug dealers dominate housing projects and rival gangs engage in shootouts for control of their business enterprises. â€œThe attitude of bystanders to our activities is quite positive,â€ he said. â€œThey say that we need more like this.â€",https://harpers.org/archive/2021/01/the-armies-of-the-right-ukraine-militias/,Neutral
2415,Did Blinken Put Poland Outside NATO Protection if It Transfers New Fighter Aircraft to Ukraine?,"If you were an adult in 1990 and had any political awareness, you probably know the story of US Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie. On July 25, Glaspie was summoned to the presidential palace in Baghdad to meet with Saddam Hussein and foreign minister Tariq Aziz on the subject of Kuwaiti â€œaggressionâ€ against Iraq. In the course of Husseinâ€™s litany complaint about the Kuwaitis, one of which was Kuwait selling oil too cheap, Glaspie remarked:

I think I understand this. I have lived here for years. I admire your extraordinary efforts to rebuild your country. I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait.

At the time, this was viewed as having given the green light to Hussein to invade Kuwait without worrying about an American response.*

After yesterday, I wonder if weâ€™ve created another situation for the war in Ukraine to spread by what weâ€™ve said or failed to say.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, former Warsaw Pact countries who are all too familiar with the fraternal leadership of Russia were quick off the mark to supply Ukraine with weapons and supplies to allow them to resist Russia. Some countries put together a plan to provide the Ukrainian Air Force with 70 additional fighter or attack aircraft: 56 MiG-29s from Poland (28 aircraft), Slovakia (12), and Bulgaria (16), and 14 Su-25s from Bulgaria.

The plan was for the aircraft to be ferried to an airbase in Poland, where they would be married up with Ukrainian pilots and flown home. I have some questions about the whole plan. The Western MiGs and Sukhois are not off-the-assembly-line aircraft. They have Western avionics, and their powerplants have been upgraded. As such, they are not the same aircraft operated by the Ukrainian Air Force. I havenâ€™t read any authoritative account of how the Ukrainians plan to maintain these aircraft, and one canâ€™t help but wonder if the plan isnâ€™t to service them in Poland, fly them to a base in Ukraine, run a few missions there, and return to Poland. Last Wednesday, it looked like the whole deal was breaking down. Read the whole story at Transfer of NATO Aircraft to Ukraine Falls Through as Zelensky Resumes His Campaign for a No-Fly Zone.

As it turned out, the deal didnâ€™t break down because it was impractical; it broke down due to the behind-the-scenes machinations of the Biden junta, see Revealed: The Real Reason That Deal to Send Fighter Jets to Ukraine Fell Through. This is par for the course â€” the single biggest stumbling block to a unified Western response to Russiaâ€™s aggression has been Joe Biden. Biden is so totally dependent upon the good offices of Russia to negotiate a nuclear pact with Iran that he canâ€™t crack down hard on Russia and is forcing our allies to pull their punches as well, see Will Biden Betray Ukraine and NATO by Lifting Sanctions to Get Putinâ€™s Help With a New Iran Nuclear Deal?

On Sunday, Secretary of State Tony Blinken addressed the subject on Meet the Press. (The video is queued to the quote for your convenience.)

CHUCK TODD: And joining me now from Moldova is Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Secretary Blinken, welcome back to Meet the Press. SEC. ANTONY BLINKEN: Thanks, Chuck. CHUCK TODD: I want to start with some of the asks that President Zelenskyy made of Congress yesterday morning here, our time, and I assume he made some similar asks in his phone call with President Biden. Weâ€™ve got a bullet points here, the no-fly zone, more planes, drones and lethal aid, a full ban on Russian oil imports, and to terminate Russiaâ€™s preferential trading status. I want to set aside the no-fly zone situation here for a minute. Letâ€™s start with planes. It seems that weâ€™re close, this idea of essentially U.S. fighter jets to Poland, in exchange Poland sends Russian-made jets to Ukraine. Is that going to happen? And how quickly can it happen? SEC. ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, first, let me say this, President Zelenskyyâ€™s been a remarkable leader. Heâ€™s been the embodiment of the Ukrainian people and everything theyâ€™re doing to resist this, this Russian aggression. And President Bidenâ€™s in regular contact with him, as he was just yesterday. On this question of planes, yes, weâ€™re talking very actively about this, looking at what we could do to backfill Poland. If it chooses to send the MiGs and the Su-planes that it has to Ukraine, how we can help by backfilling what theyâ€™re giving to the Ukrainians. So thatâ€™s in very active discussion as we speak. CHUCK TODD: You said if, if Poland â€“ thatâ€™s a Polish decision, not a NATO decision? SEC. ANTONY BLINKEN: Itâ€™s a, itâ€™s a sovereign decision by Poland. If they choose to do it, we want to make sure that we can help them and, again, backfill what theyâ€™re giving so that they donâ€™t have any loss in their own ability â€” CHUCK TODD: So we are 100% â€“ SEC. ANTONY BLINKEN: â€“ to provide security â€“ CHUCK TODD: â€“ going to do this. If any of these NATO nations that have these Russian-made planes donate them to the Ukraine, Ukraine, weâ€™re going to backfill, if theyâ€™re a NATO ally. SEC. ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, look, we got to â€“ weâ€™d have to work through each case on its, on its own merits. Got to make sure weâ€™re able to do something if thatâ€™s what a countryâ€™s requesting in return for, for sharing the jets that they have.

Letâ€™s take a moment here to consider what Putin has said. He has declared that an attack on Russian forces coming from any country outside Ukraine will result in Russia considering that as â€œparticipation in the armed conflict.â€ This quote is in the context of the possible NATO no-fly zone, but here is a guy who claims he wants to â€œdenazifyâ€ a country literally headed by a Jewish guy.

In my interpretation, Blinken just told Poland, â€œYouâ€™re on your own, Scooter.â€ He said you are free to send aircraft to Ukraine, but it is not part of any NATO operation.

Suppose Putin interprets aircraft ferrying from Poland to Ukraine as an imminent attack on Russian forces and lobs a missile or three at the airbase. Would we consider that as triggering the mutual defense provisions of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty?

The topic of transferring aircraft is the subject of a lot of tension in Poland, too. Witness this exchange between a Polish media outlet and the Polish prime ministerâ€™s office.

â€¼ï¸FAKE NEWSâ€¼ï¸

Unfortunately you are spreading misinformation with quotation from 27/02/22. Poland won't send its fighter jets to #Ukraine as well as allow to use its airports. We significantly help in many other areas.https://t.co/wjNOgh97JT â€” Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland (@PremierRP_en) March 6, 2022

This is sort of ambiguous. It can be interpreted that Polish aircraft will not participate in combat operations in Ukraine or that Poland wonâ€™t transfer aircraft to Ukraine to be used in combat. The tweet used by the Chancery to give its tweet emphasis clearly refers to operations by the Polish Air Force and not to transferring ownership. (Just now, the Pentagon briefing gave the impression that the aircraft transfer is underway.)

If those aircraft are transferred, there is no easy and clean way to do it and not give Putin the opportunity to take a shot at Poland if he wishes.

7139,"Britain to sanction Russia â€˜hardâ€™ immediately, Johnson says","London: Britain will immediately impose hard economic sanctions on Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday.

A Reuters witness saw tanks and other military hardware moving through the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk after Putin formally recognised the breakaway regions and ordered the deployment of Russian forces to â€œkeep the peaceâ€.

â€œWe will immediately institute a package of economic sanctions,â€ Johnson told reporters.

â€œThis is, I should stress, just the first barrage of UK economic sanctions against Russia, because we expect Iâ€™m afraid that there is more Russian irrational behaviour to come.â€ Johnson said he would set out the sanctions in the House of Commons, probably at around 1230 GMT.

The sanctions, Johnson said, would be â€œtargeted not just at entities in Donbass and Luhansk and Donetsk, but in Russia itself - targeting Russian economic interests as hard as we can.â€ Britain has threatened to cut off Russian companiesâ€™ access to US dollars and British pounds, blocking them from raising capital in London and to expose what Johnson calls the â€œRussian dollâ€ of property and company ownership.

Britain has not yet spelled out who would fall under the sanctions, but has pledged that there would be nowhere for Russian oligarchs to hide. Johnson has said targets could include Russian banks.

Hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into London and Britainâ€™s overseas territories from Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and London has become the Western city of choice for the super-wealthy of Russia and other former Soviet republics.

Invasion has begun

Putin will find he has â€œgravely miscalculatedâ€, Johnson said, adding that Moscow appeared to be bent on a full scale invasion of its former Soviet neighbour.

Johnson chaired a meeting of Britainâ€™s national emergency security committee early on Tuesday.

â€œI think that the tragedy of the present situation is that President Putin has surrounded himself with like-minded advisors who tell him that Ukraine is not a proper country. And I think that he is going to find that he has gravely miscalculated,â€ Johnson told reporters after the meeting.

Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine has created a situation as grave as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, Johnsonâ€™s health minister said.

â€œYou can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun,â€ British Health Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News. â€œThe Russians, President Putin, has decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine and its territorial integrity.â€

The Cuban missile crisis erupted in 1962 when the Soviet Union responded to a US missile deployment in Turkey by sending ballistic missiles to Cuba.

The sanctions, Johnson said, would hit Russiaâ€™s economy hard.",https://gulfnews.com/world/europe/the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-has-begun--uk-1.85919486,Anti-Russian
8885,An eclair to go with that artillery fire? Welcome to Kyiv's jarring new normal,"KYIV, Ukraine â€” Itâ€™s hard to think of a more unlikely combo than war zones and cinnamon buns.

Yet there the buns are in the display cabinet of Khlibar, a high-end bakery and coffee shop (whose name means Bread Bar) in Podil, the hipster neighborhood in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Slathered in cream cheese frosting, they sit on trays laden with poppy seed pastries, cherry rolls, cheese braids and delicately constructed puff pastry cakes with a bouffant of icing.

Thereâ€™s no lack of takers, with dozens of patrons lining up in a chaotic queue outside or sitting on high chairs inside for a sugar-and-caffeine fix despite the drumbeat of Russian artillery and rockets blasting on Kyivâ€™s outskirts.

Itâ€™s one sign of the new normal here, as the cityâ€™s remaining residents readjust to a life under conflict.

The two columns of Russian armor thrusting toward the city spurred Kyiv to go on a war footing. Checkpoints with toy-jack-shaped anti-tank obstacles, concrete slabs and sandbags, manned by jittery soldiers and reservists, sprouted on every major street and boulevard. People lined up in front of supermarkets and pharmacies to stock up on supplies before hurrying home. Most other establishments were shuttered as possibly half of the cityâ€™s 3 million people fled to safer areas.

But three weeks into the invasion, some of those still here have begun to make a change.

Khilbar closed at the start of the war but opened again three days later, first by offering loaves of bread to help alleviate supply shortages, said Sergei Chernets, 42, an entrepreneur who owns four businesses, including Khlibar.

â€œWe saw a problem. People even got into fights over bread, so there was a need. We opened up, and the lines were around the block,â€ he said.

Still, people were clamoring for something more. â€œWhen people came for bread, they kept asking, â€˜Where are the pastries? We want pastries!â€™â€ Chernets said. â€œSo we decided to do that, too.â€

He already had summoned his three bakers back to work; luckily, the rest of his staff was still in Kyiv, including two pastry chefs. He called them all back in.

â€œEvery day weâ€™re getting more customers,â€ Chernets said, adding that up until this week his was the only pastry shop operating in Podil. â€œBefore, it was just customers from Podil. Now weâ€™re getting them from the center and the other districts.â€

For Victor Mozhovi, a cameraman with local public broadcaster Suspilne who was sitting down at a table and demolishing an eclair with a colleague, places such as Khilbar are a marker of what now seems a time long ago.

â€œI drive in the car, we travel around and I see my office. ... I remember work. Itâ€™s just been a few weeks but it feels like a year,â€ he said.

Mozhovi had volunteered as a military videographer in 2015, covering the war against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine for a year before returning to civilian life. Now he was back in a war again.

â€œA lot of people canâ€™t understand this transformation. But I lived this in 2015 and already know war is war,â€ he said, running his fork through the eclair, which split open with a soft, cream-filled crunch. â€œItâ€™s important to have this, just to feel Iâ€™m still living the life I used to have a few weeks ago.â€

A stroll on a sunny spring day through Podil, which once was the heart of Kyivâ€™s industrial trade, shows others also trying to recapture a hint of their pre-invasion lifestyle.

A few blocks away from Khilbar, Valentina Yermak, 61, sat in a chair in the Koko Nailroom while Theresa Voloshyna trained her discerning eye on a lock of Yermakâ€™s hair, her hands a constant whirl around her customerâ€™s head.

â€œI want to feel like a woman. I donâ€™t want my looks to go down, and I want to stay elegant,â€ Yermak said. She gestured to Voloshyna. â€œAnd Theresa is excellent.â€

The salon reopened Tuesday after the proprietor, whoâ€™s now in Bulgaria, received many inquiries for appointments on her Instagram page. Voloshyna, 54, was one of three staff members still in Kyiv â€” â€œall the rest have gone to Germany, to Poland, Lviv, everywhere,â€ she said. The building she lives in has 300 units, but only 15 are still occupied.

She initially volunteered with a group preparing medicines and other supplies, but there was less need for her there at the moment, so she decided to go back to work. But that, too, was a form of assistance, she found.

â€œPeople are really happy when they see us. They pay for us to come to their house by taxi, and pay us extra. Itâ€™s relaxing for them to see us,â€ she said, adding that she was getting calls for something as simple as a manicure touch-up.

Voloshyna, a fashionable woman with a blond pixie cut and an air of steely competence, said that although curfew meant the salon couldnâ€™t be open for the 12 hours daily as it was before the war, there were still plenty of walk-ins.

â€œPeople tell us: â€˜Because I see you open the salon, we have hope,â€™â€ she said, adding that only one appointment was scheduled that day but that seven people had come in so far.

The reopenings are more than just a psychological boost. The war in Ukraine is having a cataclysmic effect on the countryâ€™s finances: This week, the International Monetary Fund said the Ukrainian economy is set to contract by 10% â€” and possibly by as much as 35%, if the war drags on for a long time. Though the IMF has announced rapid-financing measures for Ukraine, they canâ€™t stop the devastation already wrought on the countryâ€™s infrastructure, which is thought to be in the $100 billion range.

That prompted President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week â€” in between speeches to lawmakers around the world pleading for more military aid â€” to ease regulations and tax requirements for Ukrainian businesses, scrapping value-added tax and taxes on profit and levying only a single corporate tax of 2% on large companies. For smaller businesses, tax payments would be voluntary, Zelenskyy said.

â€œThat is, if you can â€” pay. You canâ€™t â€” no questions asked,â€ he said in a video address this week.

Inspections also would be canceled for all businesses â€œin order to allow everyone to work normally, in order to enable cities to return to life, in order to allow life to continue in all places where there is no fighting,â€ he said, adding that the â€œeconomic suppression of Ukraineâ€ was one of Russiaâ€™s war aims.

â€œThere is only one condition: You must ensure the normal operation of your business within the framework of Ukrainian legislation,â€ Zelenskyy said.

Some entrepreneurs are also reorienting their businesses toward helping the government. Michael Chobanian, a Bitcoin maven who started Kuna, a cryptocurrency exchange, already had transferred much of his staff from the company office in Podil to the Balkan nation of Montenegro ahead of the hostilities. He, too, has left Ukraine but is leveraging his exchange to help the government in Kyiv convert the estimated $100 million in crypto donations received since the war began to U.S. dollars or other currencies.

â€œWeâ€™ve already managed some of that, and now weâ€™re trying to scale up because a lot of donations are coming in through Bitcoin,â€ he said. â€œMy job is to make sure everything is going as fast as possible with minimum commissions and cost.â€

Zelenskyyâ€™s message to reopen also has resonated with Kyivites engaged in more quotidian businesses. Thatâ€™s why Maria Liashenko, a 31-year-old barista ensconced amid the accoutrements of a Buck Coffee Roasters branch in Podil, reopened the store Tuesday.

â€œI did it for the guests, for the economy. It needs to be supported. Our military needs to get paid,â€ she said. â€œThis is my country and I will not surrender it.â€",https://theeagle.com/an-eclair-to-go-with-that-artillery-fire-welcome-to-kyivs-jarring-new-normal/article_93121c78-a65e-11ec-9592-6be3d6277617.html,Neutral

Is it normal for an army that is already facing worldwide disinformation campaigns to massacre civilians right as they are leaving town, knowing that photos of the evidence will be captured hours later? â€” Cernovich (@Cernovich) April 3, 2022

Iâ€™m keen to see where Tucker comes down in tonightâ€™s monologue. My moneyâ€™s on a â€œRussians probably did it but why canâ€™t we ask questions?â€ cop-out.

Zelensky visited the newly liberated town today to see firsthand what Russian occupation looks like:

If you want to know the story behind these men's dead bodies, read the interview with someone who stayed with them in a bomb shelterâ€¦until Russian soldiers came and shot each of them who had served in 2014-2105, or even had a tattoo of Ukraine's trident. https://t.co/hneQeQywUi pic.twitter.com/yPKbmyJFX2 â€” Christo Grozev (@christogrozev) April 4, 2022

Times reporters are also there, interviewing witnesses who experienced the occupation. They happened to chat with the elderly woman featured in this clip that I posted yesterday and got the backstory on how that scene came to be. During the first days of the war, the womanâ€™s daughter had seen tanks coming up the street and assumed they were Ukrainian; when she went out into her front yard to get a better look, she realized they were Russian. Too late â€” they shot her dead on the spot. Her mother, whoâ€™s 76, apparently couldnâ€™t do more than simply cover the body with wood and plastic. Itâ€™s been lying there ever since.

A local coroner is back inside the town too and collecting the remains. There were too many to store in the morgue so theyâ€™ve dug a mass grave and are burying the bodies as quickly as possible:

Mr. Kaplishny said that before he left Bucha â€” as back-and-forth battles raged and then the Russian Army established control â€” he had buried 57 bodies in a cemetery. Fifteen of those people had died of natural causes, the rest from gunshot wounds, including point-blank shots, or from shrapnel. Three of the bodies were those of Ukrainian soldiers, he said. Before leaving town in March, he said, he had arranged for a local backhoe operator to dig a mass grave in the yard of an Orthodox church. Without electricity for refrigeration, the morgue had become intolerable, and another solution was needed. â€œIt was a horror,â€ he saidâ€¦ By the end of the day, back in town, he said that he had picked up about 30 more bodies in a white van. Thirteen of them were men whose hands had been tied and who had been shot at close range in the head. He said he did not know the circumstances of their deaths but believed, based on their apparently recent deaths, that they were prisoners killed before the Russian Army withdrewâ€¦ Svitlana Munich, a former classmate of the dead woman, stood nearby in tears. â€œThey shot everyone they saw,â€ she said of the Russians. â€œThey shot the gas pipe, too, and her mother was in the house.â€

Hereâ€™s the scene from space:

At what point does a series of war crimes become something more?

Ed wrote earlier about the manifesto published in Russian state media today calling for the â€œpurificationâ€ of Ukraine and â€œre-educationâ€ of any survivors. That logic is built on the lie at the heart of all Russian propaganda about the country, that Zelenskyâ€™s government has created a Nazi state. The moral urgency to smash a Nazi state is such that anything can be forgiven in the name of victory, at least in Russiaâ€™s view. Which means their approach to the conflict is trending towards genocide:

The official legal definition of genocide is ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such"". When I teach genocide I start by saying that this definition has huge problems because it doesn't give us /2 â€” Eugene Finkel (@eugene_finkel) April 4, 2022

that doesn't start as genocide might evolve into one when conditions change. Russian invasion, in my view, did not start with clear genocidal intent, but evolved into one. Regime change and colonial subjugation are by themselves not enough to constitute genocide. Second, more /4 â€” Eugene Finkel (@eugene_finkel) April 4, 2022

I know Russian. I have read a lot of Russian nationalist rhetoric in my life. This is not some wild intellectual fantasy, it is a clear, actionable statement of intent by a state agency. The UN definition is problematic, but in this case it fits like a glove â€” Eugene Finkel (@eugene_finkel) April 4, 2022

Question: If the Russian army canâ€™t defeat a â€œNazi armyâ€ on the battlefield, can Putin logically refrain from using nuclear weapons to finish the Ukrainians? Russia canâ€™t be expected to tolerate a â€œNazi regimeâ€ right on its border whom it canâ€™t dominate militarily, right?

Ukraine's bid for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not on the agenda, and will not happen in the foreseeable future, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced.""We Europeans and the transatlantic community have warned Russia that military aggression against Ukraine would be a severe error, and we do not want this to happen,"" the chancellor added. Scholz suggested that the deployment of ""well over 100,000 Russian soldiers"" near the border with its Ukrainian neighbour has no justification.The German leader said the West was willing to talk with Russia about its security proposals, but that it would ""of course make a clear distinction between untenable demands and legitimate security interests...The fundamental principles of the OSCE [Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe] are non-negotiable for us. Russia has agreed to them, and they include the right to freely choose one's alliances. At the same there are questions of security that are important for both sides, first and foremost transparency around weapons systems and exercises, risk mitigation mechanisms and new approaches to arms control,"" he said.Commenting on his visit to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin last Tuesday, Scholz said he had made it ""clear"" to his Russian counterpart that ""any further violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine would have a high price for Russia, in political economic and geostrategic terms."" Scholz also insisted that Berlin and its allies remain committed to diplomacy, both on the Ukraine crisis and on European security in general. The chancellor expressed special gratitude to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his supposed ""commitment"" to the Minsk Agreements aimed at restoring peace to eastern Ukraine.War of WordsScholz's comments come amid a dramatic escalation of tensions in the Donbass, with the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk mobilising militia units and announcing an evacuation of the civilian population amid mass shelling by Kiev forces and fears that Ukraine is preparing to launch an all-out offensive.On Friday, Russian officials including President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed ""alarm"" about the situation in the Donbass, and called on Kiev to immediately sit down to negotiations with the Donbass breakaways to implement the Minsk Agreements.Kiev's renewed aggression in the Donbass comes after months of now-debunked claims by Western officials and media that Russia is preparing to ""invade Ukraine,"" and warnings by Moscow that NATO would use the ""invasion"" claims to justify a further buildup of troops and military equipment on Russia's doorstep.In December, in a bid to ease regional tensions and reverse the deterioration of relations with NATO, the Russian Foreign Ministry published a pair of security proposals calling on NATO to halt its eastward expansion, and for both sides to limit troop, missile, warship and aircraft deployments in areas where they could be perceived a threat by the other party. Moscow also asked NATO to limit the deployment of troops and weapons systems, including missiles, in Eastern European countries which joined NATO after the end of the Cold War.The Western alliance rejected Russia's proposals, saying that its 'open door' policy for joining will remain in place, and rejecting limitations on military deployments in Eastern Europe. The United States sent 5,000 additional troops to Poland, and redeployed 1,000 troops from Germany to Romania, and has threatened to send additional troops to Europe at a moment's notice, if necessary.Western officials regularly cite OSCE agreements signed in 1999 and 2010 regarding the freedom of member nations to join whatever security alliance they like. In an interview with Sputnik last month, Foreign Minister Lavrov said that Russia takes a broader, more comprehensive view of these treaties to include the principle of the indivisibility of security.Russia's firm insistence on halting NATO's expansion via formal treaties comes in the wake of built up feelings of animosity over the West's broken promises not to expand east following the end of the Cold War. In 1990, US Secretary of State James Baker explicitly promised then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev not to expand the bloc ""one inch east"" of a reunified Germany. Since then, NATO has incorporated every single member of the former Moscow-led Warsaw Pact bloc, three republics of the former USSR itself, and four republics of the ex-Yugoslavia. On top of this, the US has built components of a missile defence system in Poland and Romania. Moscow has expressed fears that these installations can easily be converted to fire offensive, nuclear-tipped Tomahawk cruise missiles deep into Russia with almost no warning time.

4923,General Now Leading Putinâ€™s War in Ukraine Has Brutal Reputation As â€˜Butcher of Syriaâ€™,"Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a medal award ceremony at the Kremlin in 2016. Putin awarded him the title of â€˜Hero of the Russian Federation.â€™ (Photo: The Kremlin)

(CNSNews.com) â€“ Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed in charge of the invasion of Ukraine an army general notorious for ruthless actions in support of the Assad regime in Syria, prompting concerns that the conflict could become even more brutal.

Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikovâ€™s appointment to the task has already been linked to a missile strike Friday on a railway station in eastern Ukraine where several thousand people trying to flee the region ahead of the Russian forces were waiting to evacuate. More than 50 people, including children, were killed in the attack in Kramatorsk.

The general led the Russian military effort to prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2015-2016 before being promoted to command the Russian military district that covers the North Caucasus as well as Russian-occupied Crimea.

In the Syrian campaign, Russian and Assad regime operations against the rebel-held eastern city of Aleppo included the use of incendiary and cluster munitions in the bombing of civilian areas and facilities, including hospitals. Putin in 2016 awarded him the title of â€œHero of the Russian Federation.â€

â€œYou have a new commander [in the Ukraine invasion]. You have General Dvornikov,â€ David Petraeus, former CIA director and commander of U.S. Central Command, said on CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Unionâ€ on Sunday.

â€œHe is known as the â€˜butcher of Syriaâ€™ for this brutal campaign that he prosecuted in Syria when he was the commander there in 2016.â€

Host Jake Tapper asked Petraeus if Dvornikovâ€™s appointment meant there would even more targeting of civilians.

â€œI fear that it may,â€ he said. â€œAgain, the Russians were known in Syria basically for â€“ quote â€“ â€˜depopulatingâ€™ areas. Thatâ€™s what they did to Aleppo. Thatâ€™s what they did to other areas.â€

â€œAnd I think we can expect that. We saw the very first operation taken under him includes that terrible strike on the rail station.â€

With the Russians having pulled back from the failed attempt to capture Kyiv to focus on the Donbas region in the southeast, Petraeus said they likely hope to succeed there by May 9, the day Russia marks victory in World War II.

â€œThe hallmark of the Russian forces so far has been indiscipline, not discipline,â€ Petraeus said. â€œIt has been violation of the Geneva Convention and the law of land warfare and so forth. We have seen repeated evidence of that.â€

â€œAnd thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to see more of, I fear, in the days and weeks that lie ahead.â€

â€œSo, we got to do everything we can to provide everything as quickly as possible,â€ he added, in reference to military weapons and equipment Ukraine is asking for.

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on the same program that no appointment of a general to oversee the war â€œcan erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine.â€

But he also acknowledged Dvornikovâ€™s controversial record.

â€œThis particular general has a resume that includes a brutality against civilians in other theaters, in Syria. And we can expect more of the same in this theater,â€ he said.

â€œThis general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians,â€ Sullivan said. â€œAnd the United States, as I said before, is determined to do all that we can to support the Ukrainians as they resist him and they resist the forces that he commands.â€

Dvornikov has been sanctioned by the British government since 2019, for actions in support of â€œthe consolidation of the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation, which in turn further undermines the territorial integrity of Ukraine.â€

â€˜Cruel and criminal and wrong and evilâ€™

Russiaâ€™s defense and foreign ministries denied responsibility for Fridayâ€™s deadly missile strike on the Kramatorsk train station, charging that Ukrainian armed forces were to blame.

â€œObviously, we are not buying the denial by the Russians that they werenâ€™t responsible,â€ said a senior Pentagon official briefing on background.

â€œI would note that they originally claimed a successful strike, and then only retracted it when there were reports of civilian casualties,â€ the official said. â€œSo itâ€™s our full expectation that this was a Russian strike.â€

As of Friday, the U.N. human rights office in Geneva said it had recorded 1,793 Ukrainian civilians killed and 2,439 injured in the six-week war, with most casualties caused by shelling, missiles, and in air strikes. As before, it said the actual figures are believed to be considerably higher.

When Putin on February 24 announced the invasion he said the goal was to â€œstrive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraineâ€ and to bring to justice those who he claimed that committed crimes against civilians, including Russian citizens, in the Donbas.

The invasion has been widely assessed as not having gone according to plan, running into unexpectedly Ukrainian resistance.

As Russian forces late last month withdrew from areas around the capital â€“ for what the Pentagon said appeared to be a refocusing on the Donbas region â€“ evidence of widespread deliberate killings of civilians began to emerge along with the discovery of mass graves.

Tapper asked Sullivan on Sunday if the Russian forces were committing genocide.

â€œIn my opinion, the label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil and need to be responded to decisively,â€ Sullivan replied. â€œAnd that is what we are doing.â€

â€œAnd weâ€™re doing that not just by supporting international investigations and gathering evidence to hold the perpetrators all the way to the highest levels accountable,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™re doing it by providing sophisticated weapons to the Ukrainians that are making a major difference on the battlefield.â€

Genocide is defined in international law as the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, accompanied by atrocities aimed at achieving that goal.",https://cnsnews.com/index.php/article/international/patrick-goodenough/general-now-leading-putins-war-ukraine-has-brutal,Anti-Russian
3961,Blinken to travel to the Middle East and North Africa next week,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to the Middle East and North Africa next week as the Russian invasion of Ukraine crosses the one month mark.

Blinken will travel to Israel, the West Bank, Morocco, and Algeria from March 26-30 to consult with partners on a range of regional and global priorities, including the Russian governmentâ€™s war on Ukraine, the State Department said.

His visit will also focus on â€œIranâ€™s destabilizing activities, the Abraham Accords and normalization agreements with Israel, Israeli-Palestinian relations, and preserving the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, among other topics,â€ State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday.

The State Department added that Blinken will emphasize to all of the foreign leaders he meets that the United States stands in solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine as the Kremlinâ€™s aggression continues in Europe.

â€œWe will continue to work closely with our allies and partners to impose further costs on Putin and his enablers if Putin does not change course,â€ Price said.

Blinken will begin his foreign visit in Israel and the West Bank, where he is scheduled to meet Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and other senior members of government. He will also meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.

7116,Putin recognizes independence of Ukraine breakaway regions,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized as independent two breakaway territories in eastern Ukraine, marking a sharp escalation in tensions between Moscow and the West.

In signing the decrees recognizing the Donetsk Peoples Republic and Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic, Putin rejected diplomatic efforts to cease fighting and pledged more assistance to separatists battling Ukrainian forces.

â€œI deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago, to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk Peoples Republic and Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic,â€ Putin said in a speech from Moscow, in translated remarks.

â€œI would request the federal assembly to back this decision and ratify the agreement of friendship and mutual help with both republics.â€

Putin made the announcement at the end of a winding speech that set out his vision of a Ukraine that has historically been part of Russia and is now under the control of the West. He also used the occasion to fire off a litany of accusations against Ukraine, the U.S. and Western allies, coupled with a sharp demand for Kyiv to â€œstop hostilitiesâ€ and a rejection of the authority of the Ukrainian government as having been established in a â€œcoupâ€ following the 2014 revolution in the country.

He was joined in Moscow for a signing ceremony by the self-declared heads of two territories and said the documents were to ratify an agreement of â€œfriendshipâ€ and mutual aid.

â€œThose who seize the power and keep the power in Kyiv, we demand to stop hostilities immediately, otherwise, all the responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodbath will be on the consciousness of the regime that is ruling in Kyiv. By declaring these decisions, Iâ€™m confident that I will have support of all the patriotic forces of Russia,â€ Putin said.

The Russian presidentâ€™s actions on Monday prompted a quick response from the Biden administration, with White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki issuing a statement that the U.S. was preparing to immediately imposing sanctions.

â€œWe have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately,â€ Psaki said in a statement, adding that the sanctions include prohibiting new investment, trade and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in the â€œso-called DNR [Donetsk] and LNR [Luhansk] regions of Ukraine.â€

Additional measures are expected to be announced, she added.

U.S. allies also rejected Putinâ€™s move, with the Kremlin referencing pushback from France and Germany in a phone call with the Russian leader where he informed them of his decision to recognize the separatistsâ€™ regions as independent.

â€œThe president of France and the Federal Chancellor of Germany expressed their disappointment with this development. At the same time, they indicated their readiness to continue contacts,â€ the Kremlin said in a statement.

Putin set up his announcement Monday by earlier presiding over a public and highly choreographed meeting of the Russian National Security Council where members expressed near unanimity for the Kremlin to recognize the territories as independent.

The Russian president said he had convened the meeting in response to requests from the self-declared leaders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions requesting Moscow recognize their independence, and a resolution passed in the Russian State Duma supporting Moscow conferring independence.

The Biden administration had earlier warned against Putin making such a move, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying the U.S. would impose a â€œswift and firm responseâ€ if the Kremlin recognized independence and that it would be viewed as a rejection of the Minsk agreements, a diplomatic framework established in 2015 aimed at ending the fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, where an estimated 15,000 people have been killed.

A White House official said Monday that President Biden was meeting with his national security team to discuss the developments related to Russia and Ukraine, with reports of Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley at the White House.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter that he had spoken with French President Emanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Sholz following Putinâ€™s security council meeting, and convened a meeting of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council.

Fighting has escalated in the Donbas in recent days, with U.S., Ukrainian and other European officials placing blame on Russian-backed separatists for provoking violence, including the shelling of a kindergarten in the region, and praising Ukrainian forces for restraint.

The increase in fighting is coupled with warnings from the U.S. and its allies and partners that Russia seeks to manufacture a â€œfalse-flagâ€ operation to create a pretext for Russia to invade Ukraine and would launch a large-scale invasion with nearly 200,000 troops that includes removing the Ukrainian government in Kyiv.

Estoniaâ€™s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas tweeted earlier on Monday that recognizing the breakaway regions â€œwould be a serious escalation by the Kremlin.â€

â€œIt would be a clear and grave violation of international law and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Donetsk and Luhansk are and will be part of Ukraine,â€ she wrote on Twitter. â€œThis decision would also end the Minsk agreements. By saying â€˜noâ€™ to a political solution based on the Minsk agreements, the Kremlin shuts the door on diplomacy and creates an excuse for war.â€

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called Putinâ€™s move a â€œbreach of international lawâ€ and a â€œflagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine,â€ during a press conference.

Johnson further said the move showed Moscow rejecting diplomacy in the format of the Minsk agreements and â€œitâ€™s a very ill omen and a very dark sign, and it certainly is yet another indication that things are moving in the wrong direction in Ukraine.â€

â€œWe will continue to think about what more we can do support Ukraine in what is clearly a very, very dark and difficult time,â€ the prime minister said.

European Union President Ursula Von der Leyen echoed Johnsonâ€™s condemnations and said the E.U. and its partners will â€œreact with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine.â€

Evelyn Farkas, who served as deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia during the Obama administration, said recognition of the Donbas as independent may trigger some sanctions but that more devastating consequences would be reserved to be used against military action.

â€œI think the Biden people have been pretty clear that it is military action they are looking for to include cyber and little green men,â€ Farkas said, but added that recognition could be a prelude to using armed force.

â€œThe reality is, if he goes ahead and recognizes them, heâ€™s likely to send more forces in and thatâ€™s likely to trigger sanctions,â€ she said, likening it to Russia sending troops into Georgie in 2008 after recognizing separtist territories in the north-eastern and central part of that country as independent.

Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, wrote on Twitter that Putinâ€™s recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk is likely an opening salvo against Ukraine.

â€œAfter Putin recognizes Donetsk and Luhansk, Zelensky will have to respond, right? And if he does, then Putin can justify invading as a reaction to Ukrainian â€˜aggressionâ€™ and â€˜protectionâ€™ of their new allies,â€ he tweeted.

Russian stock market trading halt extended to March 18

The Moscow Exchange equity market will remain shut until at least March 18, extending a record shutdown meant to shield domestic investors from the impact of harsh sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The central bank announced the decision on its website Saturday and said a decision on whether trading would resume from March 21 would be announced later. Stock trading has been halted since February 25.

Local traders are bracing for a selloff as investors react to a slew of fresh measures over the past two weeks, including import bans on Russian oil by the US and UK The ruble slumped on Wednesday when foreign-exchange trading resumed after being shuttered since March 5.

Although Russia has promised to prop up its equity market with up to $10 billion when it reopens, strategists expect local stocks could sink as much as 50% as international sanctions hit everything from Russia's ability to access foreign reserves to the SWIFT bank-messaging system.

France says Putin is not ready to end Ukraine war, fighting rages

Fighting raged near Kyiv on Saturday and heavy shelling in other areas threatened new attempts to evacuate trapped civilians as France said Russian President Vladimir Putin showed no readiness to end the war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow was sending in new troops after Ukrainian forces put 31 of Russia's battalion tactical groups out of action in what he called Russia's largest army losses in decades. It was not possible to verify his statements.

He also said about 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed so far and urged the West to get more involved in peace negotiations. The president suggested Russian forces would face a fight to the death if they sought to enter the capital.

""If they decide to carpet bomb (Kyiv), and simply erase the history of this region, the history of the Kyivan Rus, the history of Europe, and destroy all of us, then they will enter Kyiv. If that's their goal, let them come in, but they will have to live on this land by themselves,"" he told a news conference.

Ukrainian foreign minister says ready to negotiate, but will not surrender

Ukraine was ready to negotiate to end the war started by Russia's attack more than two weeks ago, but would not surrender or accept any ultimatums, the country's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Saturday.

Speaking at a virtual event organised by the non-partisan, nonprofit organization Renew Democracy Initiative, Kuleba said civilian lives would be saved if Ukraine had fighter jets and more attack planes to destroy large military columns.

""We will continue to fight. We are ready to negotiate but we are not going to accept any ultimatums and surrender"", Kuleba said, adding that Russia was putting forward demands that were ""unacceptable"".

Commenting on the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the Ukrainian foreign minister said it was besieged but still under Ukrainian control.

The foreign minister added that Ukraine needed more military supplies and that more steps were needed to hit the Russian economy despite recent sanctions.

""If we had more planes we would have been able to save many more civilian lives mainly because the main striking force of Russia is in the air and they indiscriminately choose to attack.

As we continue to fight we will need more and more weapons,"" Kuleba added.

Biden to authorise further $200m for Ukraine

US President Joe Biden is authorising the State Department to provide additional aid to Ukraine of up to $200 million.

The funds would cover weapons as well as military services, education and training as Ukrainians seek to repel a Russian invasion.

Joe Biden

The aid is part of broader US support in the form of aid and sanctions. When Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that $1 billion in aid had been provided to Ukraine.

The ongoing warfare has led to additional support with Congress this week approving $13.6 billion in additional aid, a sum that includes $6.5 billion for the costs of sending troops and weapons to Eastern Europe and $6.8 billion for refugees and economic aid.

Biden plans to sign the spending bill with the additional aid when he receives it next week.

Mariupol residents dying for lack of medicines

Aid group Doctors Without Borders says some residents of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol are dying for lack of medication, while others killed in the fighting are being buried in makeshift graves by their neighbours.

The group, which is known by its French acronym MSF, says the city has been without drinking water or medicine for more than a week now. It says people are resorting to using water from the ground or tapping heating pipes, then boiling it on wood fires.

MSF says food is scarce and lack of cellphone or internet connectivity in Mariupol means only residents with access to a portable radio have information on what is happening beyond their immediate neighbourhood.

In a voice message Saturday shared with The Associated Press, one MSF staff member described seeing people who have died because of lack of medication adding that ""there are a lot of such people inside Mariupol.""

The aid worker said that there are ""many people who were killed and injured and they're just lying on the ground. Neighbours (are) just digging a hole in the ground and putting their bodies inside.""

But the governor of the Kyiv region said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing during evacuation attempts and the Donetsk region's governor said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into Mariupol.

An adviser to the Ukrainian presidency said earlier that 79 evacuation buses and two trucks with humanitarian cargo had left for Sumy on Saturday. Buses and trucks also left Zaporizhzhia for Mariupol, a video released by the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential administration on social media showed.

Italy seizes Russian billionaire's $578 million yacht

Italian financial police has seized a Russian-owned superyacht valued at 530 million euros ($578 million) in the port of Trieste as part of seizures of oligarch wealth to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the attack on Ukraine.

The ""Sy A"" yacht was identified by Italian police as belonging to belonging to billionaire Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko, who made a fortune in fertilizer production and coal energy. It was seized Friday evening.

Video shows police in cars with flashing lights approaching the triple-mast yacht and officers boarding it.

Sirens were heard in the capital city of Kyiv, the western city of Lviv in Odessa, and Kharkiv, Cherkasy, as well as in the Sumy region in northeast of the country, a number of local Ukrainian media reported.

Russian forces appeared to be regrouping on Friday for a possible attack on Kyiv, with satellite images showing them firing artillery as they closed in on the capital.

Ukraine says shelling damaged cancer hospital

Ukrainian officials accused Russia damaging a cancer hospital and several residential buildings in the southern city of Mykolaiv with shelling from heavy artillery.

The hospitalâ€™s head doctor, Maksim Beznosenko, said several hundred patients were in the hospital during the attack but that no one was killed. The attack damaged the building and blew out windows.

Russian forces have stepped up their attacks on Mykolaiv, located 470 kilometers (292 miles) south of Kyiv, in an attempt to encircle the city.

Ukrainian and Western officials earlier accused Russia of shelling a maternity hospital in the southern city of Mariupol on Wednesday. Three people died in that attack.

Images show Russian military units continuing to deploy closer to Kyiv

Satellite images taken on Friday showed Russian military units were continuing to deploy closer to Ukraine's capital Kyiv and were firing artillery toward residential areas, a US private company said.

Maxar Technologies said multiple homes and buildings were on fire and widespread damage and impact craters could be seen throughout the town of Moschun, northwest of Kyiv.

Maxar said one image showed elements of a Russian artillery battalion actively firing in a southeasterly direction, a bright muzzle flash coming from one of the guns. It said it could not confirm the battalion's targets, but that the damage observed in Moschun was about 7km southeast of the artillery deployment.

Another image showed long lines of cars carrying people trying to flee Kyiv, and another showed that fires continued to burn at Antonov Airport.

Russian forces bombarded cities across the country on Friday and appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault on Kyiv as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country had reached a ""strategic turning point"" in the conflict.

US accuses Russia of violating 'nuclear safety principles'

The United States has accused Russia of violating nuclear safety principles, saying it was concerned by ""continued Russian firing on nuclear facilities"" in Ukraine but added that there were no signs detected yet of any radiological release.

""We are monitoring reports of damage to a research facility in Kharkiv. Near-term safety risk is low, but the continued Russian firing on nuclear facilities must cease"", US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Friday on Twitter.

Ukraine and Russia: What you need to know right now

Ukrainian President Zelenskiy said his country had reached a ""strategic turning point"" in the conflict. Satellite images showed Russian military units closer to the capital Kyiv and firing artillery toward residential areas.

Fighting

* The situation in Ukraine's southeastern city of Mariupol was critical, officials said, as Russian forces tightened their noose around the Black Sea port and the death toll from shelling and a 12-day blockade reached almost 1,600.

* Britain said Russian air and missile forces had conducted strikes in the past 24 hours against the western Ukrainian cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk.

* Ukraine said neighbour Belarus could be planning to attack its territory and accused Russia of trying to drag its ally into the war by staging air attacks on Belarus from Ukrainian air space.

Economy and Sanctions

* US President Biden joined with allies to hit Moscow on trade and shut down development funds, and announced a ban on imports of Russian seafood and diamonds.

* The United States also imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, three family members of Putin's spokesperson, as well as lawmakers.

* Washington will revoke Russia's ""most favoured nation status"" US House Speaker Pelosi said. Other G7 nations and the European Union are expected to follow.

Facebook

* Facebook owner Meta Platforms said a temporary change in its content policy, only for Ukraine, was needed to let users voice opposition to Russia's attack; Moscow opened a criminal case after the company said it would allow posts such as ""death to the Russian fighters.""

United Nations

* The United Nations said it had no evidence Ukraine had a biological weapons program while Washington and its allies accused Russia of spreading the unproven claim as a possible prelude to launching its own biological or chemical attacks.",https://gulfnews.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-updates-fighting-rages-outside-kyiv-ukraine-says-evacuations-threatened-again-1.1647055281498,Neutral
10840,"Ukraine war, North Koreaâ€™s nukes, Chinaâ€™s rise: Whatâ€™s on the agenda as Biden meets Quad leaders in Tokyo","By Jessie Yeung, CNN

US President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet the leaders of India, Australia and Japan in Tokyo on Tuesday for a summit of the â€œQuadâ€ nations.

The meeting comes at the end of Bidenâ€™s first trip to Asia since becoming President, a five-day visit he began in South Korea.

The Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is an informal group focused on security that dates back to the early 2000s. It has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter Chinaâ€™s reach and territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific.

The war in Ukraine, North Koreaâ€™s weapons program, Taiwan, and a controversial new security deal between China and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific are among the issues likely to be discussed at the summit.

Hereâ€™s what you need to know about the Quad.

How did it form?

The partnership has its roots in the response to the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, when the four countries set up a â€œregional core groupâ€ to help relief efforts. But the Quad in its current form was created in 2007 and held its first meeting in May that year.

In a speech several months after that first meeting, Japanâ€™s then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described his vision of a â€œbroader Asia â€¦ an immense network spanning the entirety of the Pacific Ocean, incorporating the United States of America and Australia.â€

The countries shared â€œfundamental valuesâ€ such as freedom and democracy, and common strategic interests, he said.

The initiative fell apart in 2008 under intense pressure from China and the threat of economic retaliation, said Cleo Paskal, a non-resident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

But it was revived in 2017 amid renewed concerns about Chinaâ€™s rapid rise as a global superpower and Beijingâ€™s increasingly aggressive foreign policy.

Since then, the group has grown more active, with the four heads of state holding a symbolic virtual meeting in March 2021, before then meeting in person for the first time in September that year.

At the time, a senior US official emphasized the Quad was â€œan unofficial gathering,â€ but called it â€œa key and critical format,â€ adding â€œwe are deepening coordination on a daily basis.â€

What does the Quad do?

Though sometimes dubbed by critics as an â€œAsian NATO,â€ the Quad is not a formal military alliance â€” rather, itâ€™s an informal strategic forum, featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and military drills.

It does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in NATO, like the concept of collective defense, where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all.

â€œItâ€™s deliberately more amorphous than that, so that it can withstand changes in political decision-making in each of the democracies, and respond in a more diffuse but effective way around things like vaccines or economics,â€ Paskal said.

Quad members cooperate across fields including Covid-19 and natural disasters, climate change and sustainability.

But security and the goal of a â€œfree and open Indo-Pacificâ€ are key focuses, with the four nations frequently highlighting threats such as terrorism, disinformation and territorial disputes.

Military cooperation has increased in recent years, with Australia joining the other three in the 2020 Malabar naval exercises â€” the first time all four members had participated in the drills since 2007.

Last September, the US, the United Kingdom and Australia signed a security deal known as AUKUS that will eventually bring nuclear-powered submarines to the region â€” a move that set off a diplomatic firestorm with France and angered China.

And this January, Japan and Australia signed a treaty to strengthen defense and security cooperation, with Australia saying the agreement included â€œan expanding agenda for the Quad.â€

How does China play into this?

The Quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to Chinaâ€™s growing reach in the region, with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with Beijing over the past few years.

The India-China relationship has come under growing strain since May 2020 when troops from both sides were involved in a deadly clash along their disputed Himalayan border.

Australia and China have been involved in a series of trade spats since Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, while Japan and China remain at odds over disputed islands in the East China Sea.

The US-China relationship has also steadily deteriorated, exacerbated by a trade war, pandemic finger-pointing and military saber-rattling.

The strategic location of each of the Quad nations â€” at different corners of the Indo-Pacific and with China in between them â€” has rattled Beijing, which fears the potential for military encirclement. It has condemned the bloc as an anti-China â€œcliqueâ€ that is emblematic of a â€œpoisonousâ€ Cold War mentality.

Exacerbating these tensions, China has reiterated its territorial claims and taken a harder line in response to perceived challenges. In recent years, China has built up its military positions in the South China Sea, despite a UN tribunal dismissing its territorial claims there. It has also ramped up threats against Taiwan â€” a self-governing island the Chinese Communist Party sees as part of its territory despite never having ruled it â€” and has sent fighter jets into its air defense identification zone.

â€œChinaâ€™s rise is now the global phenomenon that not (only) involves the neighboring nations, but also the safety of maritime security in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, all the way to the Indian Ocean,â€ said Ken Jimbo, a professor in the faculty of policy management at Japanâ€™s Keio University.

In April, China announced a security pact with the Solomon Islands, sparking protests from Australia, New Zealand and the US. Many were concerned it would allow China to build a military base in the tiny Pacific nation, though the islandsâ€™ leader has said he has no intention of this happening.

Still, some onlookers say the agreement makes Australia less safe and threatens to further destabilize the Solomon Islands, where the governmentâ€™s close relationship with Beijing has already sparked protests.

â€œWhat countries are realizing more and more is that the economic investment from China is designed to lead to a weakening of political will within those countries â€¦ which brings it more strongly into the Chinese orbit,â€ said Paskal, from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

What are the other major issues?

Other issues that may come up at the summit include the security of Taiwan.

A recent surge of Chinese air incursions has raised fears for the future of the democratic island. Top US intelligence officials told Congress this month that China might be attempting to build a military capable of taking over Taiwan, and the island faces an â€œacuteâ€ threat between now and 2030.

Quad members have voiced support for Taiwan, which the US supplies with arms for self defense. On Monday, during a press conference in Japan, US President Joe Biden said the US would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force, a warning that appeared to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally held by Washington.

The White House quickly downplayed the comments, saying they donâ€™t reflect a change in US policy.

But many analysts have drawn parallels between Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine and Taiwanâ€™s situation â€” concerns echoed by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in May, when he said peace in the Taiwan Strait was â€œcriticalâ€ and countries must â€œnever tolerateâ€ forceful attempts to change the status quo in East Asia.

â€œIf Taiwan falls to China, that breaks the first island chain and compromises Japanese security,â€ Paskal said. â€œThe fall of Taiwan is a deep security threat to all four Quad partners.â€

North Korea and its weapons program will also likely be on the table, said Jimbo, the Keio University professor. The country has recently stepped up its missile testing, in defiance of international law and to the alarm of Japan and the US. It has launched 15 missile tests this year so far, compared to four tests in 2020 and eight in 2021.

The war in Ukraine will be another focus, with the summit taking place exactly three months after Russia launched its invasion. Australia, Japan and the US have all taken hard stances in condemning the invasion and imposing sanctions on Moscow â€” leaving India the odd one out.

India has long enjoyed friendly relations and a defense relationship with Moscow; most estimates suggest more than 50% of Indiaâ€™s military equipment comes from Russia. These supplies are vital, given Indiaâ€™s border tensions with both China and Pakistan.

Though Indiaâ€™s position has caused â€œa significant amount of frustrationâ€ among the other three bloc members, Jimbo said â€œit also reminds us that we do not really have the luxury to lose India from the Quad â€” so obviously, we are going to pursue what we can agree (on) at this point together with India.â€

4071,Russia says not planning to call up reserves,"Moscow/Kyiv: Russia said on Saturday it did not plan to call up reservists as Moscowâ€™s military intervention in Ukraine entered its 31st day, denouncing what it claimed were â€œfalseâ€ summons to Russian men by Kyivâ€™s security services.

â€œThe Russian defence ministry is not summoning and does not plan to summon any reservists to the military commissariats,â€ spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement.

In the statement posted on messaging app Telegram, Konashenkov said that â€œmanyâ€ Russian men had in recent days received â€œfalseâ€ phone calls notifying them of their summons to the military commissariats.

â€œAll such fake calls are made from Ukrainian territory,â€ Konashenkov said. â€œThey absolutely do not correspond to reality and are a provocation of the Ukrainian special services.â€

While Ukrainian forces have stalled the initial Russian advance and launched some successful counterattacks, there are signs that both sides are digging in for a long conflict that neither can easily win.

Additional US pledges

US President Joe Biden spoke with top Ukrainian government officials in Warsaw on Saturday during his visit to Poland to show support for the Nato allianceâ€™s eastern flank in the face of the Russian attacks.

Biden dropped in on a meeting between meeting between Ukraineâ€™s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

The United States expressed â€œunwavering commitment to Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity,â€ State Department spokesman Ned Price said.

Kuleba told reporters that Ukraine had received additional security pledges from the United States on developing defence co-operation.

Biden has held three days of emergency meetings with allies in the G7, Europe and Nato, and visited with US troops in Poland on Friday. He met Polish President Andrzej Duda on Saturday.

Biden is also scheduled to visit a refugee reception centre at Warsawâ€™s national stadium. More than 2 million people have fled the war to Poland, out of the roughly 3.8 million who have left Ukraine all together.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pushed for further talks with Russia as Moscow signalled it was scaling back its ambitions to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the east after attacks elsewhere stalled.

In an announcement on Friday appearing to indicate more limited goals, the Russian Defence Ministry said a first phase of its operation was mostly complete and it would now focus on the Donbas region bordering Russia, which has pro-Moscow separatist enclaves.

â€œThe combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which ... makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,â€ said Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staffâ€™s Main Operational Directorate.

Breakaway Russian-backed forces have been fighting Ukrainian forces in Donbas and the adjoining Luhansk region since 2014.

They declared independence with Moscowâ€™s blessing - but not recognised by the West - soon before the February 24 military intervention.

Moscow had said the goals for what it calls its â€œspecial operationâ€ include demilitarising and â€œdenazifyingâ€ its neighbour. Western officials say the invasion is unjustified and illegal, aimed at toppling Zelenskiyâ€™s pro-NATO government.

Weeks of on-and-off peace talks have failed to make significant progress. In a video address late Friday, Zelenskiy said his troopsâ€™ resistance had dealt Russia â€œpowerful blowsâ€.

â€œOur defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: we must talk, talk meaningfully, urgently and fairly,â€ Zelenskiy said.

Counterattacks around Kyiv

Battle lines near Kyiv have been frozen for weeks with two main Russian armoured columns stuck northwest and east of the capital. A British intelligence report described a Ukrainian counteroffensive that had pushed Russians back in the east.

â€œUkrainian counterattacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, have allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 km (22 miles) east of Kyiv,â€ the report said.

Volodymyr Borysenko, mayor of Boryspol, an eastern suburb where Kyivâ€™s main airport is located, said 20,000 civilians had evacuated the area, answering a call to clear out so Ukrainian troops could counterattack.

On the other main front outside Kyiv, to the capitalâ€™s northwest, Ukrainian forces have been trying to encircle Russian troops in the suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, reduced to ruins by heavy fighting.

The cities of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy north and east of Kyiv have also endured devastating bombardment. Chernihiv was effectively surrounded by Russian forces, its governor said.

Britain said it would fund 2 million pounds ($2.6 million) worth of food supplies for areas encircled by Russian forces, following a request from the Ukrainian government.",https://gulfnews.com/world/europe/russia-says-not-planning-to-call-up-reserves-1.86745191,Neutral
2541,"Stalled and frustrated, Putin will likely double-down in the coming weeks, CIA says","Stalled and frustrated, Putin will likely double-down in the coming weeks, CIA says

CIA Director William Burns said Tuesday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has fallen far short of Vladimir Putin's expectations and he believes the Russian leader is likely to escalate military operations.

""I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now. He's likely to double-down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,"" Burns testified before the House Intelligence Committee. ""His military planning and assumptions were based on a quick, decisive victory."" Burns was one of several intelligence chiefs who appeared before the committee's annual hearing on worldwide threats. The CIA director said Putin premised his war on four false assumptions: he thought Ukraine was weak, he believed Europe was distracted and wouldn't mount a strong response, he thought Russia's economy was prepared to withstand sanctions, and that Russia's military had been modernized and would fight effectively. ""He's been proven wrong on every count,"" said Burns, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2005-8.

The CIA director says he now expects Putin to escalate military operations, while the Ukrainians will continue to resist fiercely. The likely result, he says, is ""an ugly next few weeks"" of fighting for control of Ukraine's cities, including the capital Kyiv. ""His own military's performance has been largely ineffective,"" Burns said of Putin. ""Instead of seizing Kyiv within the first two days of the campaign, which is what his plan was premised upon, after nearly two full weeks they still have not been able to fully encircle the city."" Russia has suffered heavy casualties Reliable casualty figures have been hard to come by. Russia's Defense Ministry announced last week that 498 Russian soldiers had been killed, and nearly 1,600 wounded. The head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Army Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, said his best estimate is that Russian deaths have now risen to between 2,000 and 4,000.

Meanwhile, the Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, said Putin's longer term plans for Ukraine were still uncertain. ""What's unclear at this stage is whether Russia will continue to pursue a maximalist plan to capture all or most of Ukraine, which we assess would require more resources,"" Haines said. ""If they pursue the maximalist plan, we judge it will be especially challenging for the Russians to hold and control Ukrainian territory and install a sustainable pro-Russian regime in Kyiv."" Burns agreed that Putin does not appear to have a defined plan for what he would do if Russian forces take control of Ukraine. ""The challenge he faces â€” and this is the biggest question that's hung over our analysis of his planning for months now â€” is he has no sustainable political endgame in the face of what is going to continue to be fierce resistance from Ukrainians,"" Burns said. Putin positioned more than 150,000 troops near Ukraine's borders before the war began on Feb. 24. The Pentagon said Russia has now sent almost all those combat forces into Ukraine.

However, the Pentagon said it has not seen signs that Russia is moving additional forces toward Ukraine at this point. U.S. officials and analysts who follow Russia say the Russian military would need a force several times the size of the current one to maintain a sustained occupation of Ukraine. Putin's announcement on nuclear weapons is seen as a message Also, Putin last week publicly called for Russia to put its nuclear forces on a higher state of alert, and members of the committee pressed Haines on how to interpret this. She said Putin appears to be sending a message rather than taking action at this stage.

""Putin's public announcement that he ordered Russia's strategic nuclear forces to go on 'special alert' was extremely unusual,"" Haines said. ""We have not seen a public announcement by the Russians regarding a higher nuclear alert status since the 1960s."" But she added, ""we also have not observed force-wide nuclear changes that go beyond what we have seen in prior moments of heightened tensions during the last few decades. Our analysts asses that Putin's current posturing in this arena is probably intended to deter the West from providing additional support for Ukraine."" Many analysts expected Russia to carry out extensive cyber attacks against Ukraine, but so far this has not happened on a large scale. Still, the head of the National Security Agency, Gen. Paul Nakasone, said his agency is keeping close watch. ""We're very, very focused on ransomware actors,"" Nakasone testified. He said he remains concerned about ""cyber activity that's designed for perhaps Ukraine that spreads more broadly into other countries.""",https://kuow.org/stories/stalled-and-frustrated-putin-will-likely-double-down-in-the-coming-weeks-cia-says,Anti-Russian
5950,"Putinâ€™s reputed girlfriend Alina Kabaeva included in proposed EU sanctions list, sources say","By Luke McGee, CNN

Alina Kabaeva, a woman who has been romantically linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin, is included in the sixth proposed package of European Union sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, according to two European diplomatic sources.

At this stage, names can be taken off or added at member statesâ€™ discretion and is expected to be a point of negotiation when any new sanctions package is proposed, an EU Commission source told CNN.

The EU has not officially signed off on the draft proposal.

â€œDiscussions are going on. Itâ€™s not a piece of cake, but we have to wait and see,â€ one of the diplomatic sources told CNN on Friday morning.

CNN has reached out to Russiaâ€™s National Media Group, of which Kabaeva is head, for comment on the proposed sanctions.

Kabaeva, who was born in 1983, was first linked to Putin more than a decade ago, while she was a medal-winning gymnast. Putin, who is divorced, has denied a relationship with her.

In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials had been debating whether or not to place sanctions on Kabaeva, with concerns that such a move might increase tensions further because it could be an extreme personal blow to Putin.

The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is also among the individuals who are included in the proposed sixth round of EU sanctions, according to two sources who have seen the full documents.

The proposed sanctions are out of touch with â€œcommon sense,â€ Russian Orthodox Church spokesperson Vladimir Legoida said Wednesday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

â€œThe more indiscriminate (these) sanctions become, the more they lose touch with common sense and the harder it becomes to reach peace, which is what the Russian Orthodox Church prays for at every service with the blessing of His Holiness the Patriarch,â€ Legoida said in a Telegram post.

â€œOnly those completely ignorant of the history of our Church can seek to intimidate its clergy and believers by compiling some lists,â€ Legoida said.

The EU has been ratcheting up its economic action against Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine. Most recently, the bloc has proposed a ban on Russian oil imports, something that would have a major impact on Russiaâ€™s economy, though Hungary, an EU member state with close links to Putin, is likely to scupper any such plans.

Who is Alina Kabaeva?

Kabaeva and Putin reportedly met when she was a young gymnast, who won multiple medals domestically, at European competitions and at the Olympic Games. She was awarded the gold medal for rhythmic gymnastics at the Athens Games in 2004.

Widely known in her home country, she was chosen as one of the torch bearers when Russia hosted the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia in 2014, an event that took place shortly before Russia illegally annexed Ukraineâ€™s Crimean Peninsula.

Kabaeva has made public statements in support of the Russian military since the start of the war in Ukraine, most recently calling on Russian citizens to rally behind the war effort.

At a recent gymnastics event, she said: â€œEvery family has a history of war, and we shouldnâ€™t forget about it. We should hand it over from generation to generation.â€

According to the Wall Street Journal, US officials say she and her family have become wealthy due to her proximity to Putin, though the Kremlin continues to deny any relationship between the two. The US Treasury department has refused to comment on the case.

Regardless of her actual relationship with the Russian President, if her name does appear on the final list of EU sanctions, Kabaeva â€” still relatively unknown outside Russia â€” and her finances will come under huge international scrutiny.

1754,Investigate Russiaâ€™s covert funding of US anti-fossil fuel groups,"In 2014 â€“ the same year Russia annexed Crimea â€“ then-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that Russia was covertly working to undermine European and U.S. fossil fuel production.

Three years later, in 2017, Reps. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Randy Weber (R-Texas) sent a lengthy letter to then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin making a similar accusation. Importantly, their letter connected some of the dots highlighting Russiaâ€™s covert efforts to fund various environmental organizations that were trying to limit or end U.S. hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for shale gas and oil.

The media and Democrats mostly shrugged their collective shoulders at these allegations. They were far too busy trying to prove the now-discredited Russian-Trump election collusion to be bothered with a more plausible Russian-environmental activist collusion.

Maybe Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine will force those naysayers to reconsider the accusations and evidence and begin new investigations.

According to The Guardian, Rasmussen, who was also a former prime minister of Denmark, claimed in a presentation to a think tank in London, â€œI have met allies who can report that Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engaged actively with so-called non-governmental organizations (NGOs) â€“ environmental organizations working against shale gas â€“ to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas.â€

He declined to give details, saying only, â€œThat is my interpretation.â€ NATOâ€™s press office said the remarks were Rasmussenâ€™s personal views, not official NATO policy.

But a NATO official did tell The Guardian, â€œRussia has been using a mix of hard and soft power in its attempt to recreate a sphere of influence, including through a campaign of disinformation on many issues, including energy.â€

While environmental NGOs denounced Rasmussenâ€™s claims, money can be laundered through various organizations in such a way that the final recipient (e.g., a non-profit environmental activist group) has no idea of the fundingâ€™s real origins.

And thatâ€™s where the Smith-Weber letter comes in.

The letter notes that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton complained in a speech to a private audience in 2016, â€œWe were even up against phony environmental groups, and Iâ€™m a big environmentalist, but these were funded by the Russians â€¦â€

Smith and Weber assert that the Russian government and â€œcomplicit partiesâ€ had a scheme that â€œallows money originating from foreign countries like Russia to funnel through Bermuda-based shell companies to environmental groups in the United States with the aim of disrupting the U.S. energy industry.â€

They alleged that â€œtens of millions of dollarsâ€ were handed to Bermuda-based Klein Ltd., which then funneled the money to the Sea Change Foundation, which distributed the funds to various NGOs.

Clearly, environmental groups have had some success with their anti-fracking efforts. New York, Washington and Maryland have banned fracking. California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued and executive order last year banning fracking in the state by 2024.

As for Europe, fracking was never really embraced.

The Smith-Weber letter includes much more detail than I can here, so look at their letter for yourself. It does not establish Russian culpability, but it does provide a solid basis for further investigation â€” if Congress and the media are finally interested.

And they just might be. Given Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s horrendous and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, there could be a lot of interest in investigating Putinâ€™s foreign mischief.

In hindsight, it is increasingly apparent that Putin has been preparing for his Ukrainian invasion for years. Dominating the global energy market by covertly working to limit U.S. production would have been a huge coup â€” in more ways than one.

Instead, over the past decade the United States became the worldâ€™s energy powerhouse, producing 11.3 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2020, compared to Russiaâ€™s 10.50 million barrels per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

As for natural gas, the EIA says the United States produced 33.5 trillion cubic feet in 2020, verses 22.5 trillion cubic feet for Russia.

Had Russia dominated global energy production, Putin would be in a better position to thumb his nose at countries critical of his invasion â€” and deprive his critics of needed oil and gas. Putin can still squeeze his critics, but the U.S. energy industry may be able to temper the impact.

If Democrats and the media are still interested in finding some type of Russian collusion, maybe they should begin by investigating whether Russia actually has been covertly funneling money to environmental NGOs.

8921,"How hackers, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the State Department are trying to pierce Putinâ€™s digital Iron Curtain","By Sean Lyngaas, Kylie Atwood and Brian Fung, CNN

The information campaign over Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine is in full swing as a wide cast of characters â€” from the US State Department to Ukrainian hackers to Arnold Schwarzenegger â€” tries to circumvent Russian censors to get the truth about the war on Ukraine to Russian citizens.

The efforts echo Cold War-era radio broadcasts into the Soviet Union, but messaging apps and other free digital tools mean that an array of outsiders, from digital activists to Schwarzenegger, the Hollywood icon who posted a video addressing Russians on Thursday, can more easily join the campaign.

The State Department created an account on Telegram, a messaging app popular with Russians, four days into the war in Ukraine as it became clear that Washington was missing an opportunity to interact with Russians, a senior department official told CNN.

A series of posts on the account in Russian have amplified President Joe Bidenâ€™s denunciations of the war and cautioned Russians about Moscowâ€™s propaganda machine.

â€œLong before the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it had stepped up its campaign of disinformation and censorship of independent media and continues to do so even during the war of aggression,â€ the department said from its Telegram account Thursday.

Russian engagement with the State Department Telegram account to date appears to be very modest â€” the account had 1,911 subscribers as of Friday afternoon Moscow time and the countryâ€™s total population is around 142 million.

Analysts say it is unlikely that any single platform or messaging campaign is going to break through with the Russian public in a significant way. But the goal shared by a range of actors trying to pierce the digital iron curtain is to chip away, cumulatively, at Russian public support for the war and the morale of Russian soldiers.

The State Department also has an account on Russian messaging platform VK, has set up a website to rebut Russian disinformation in recent weeks and has worked to get US officials on Russian-language broadcast platforms, the official said.

Not a â€˜silver bulletâ€™

â€œNone of it is a silver bullet,â€ the State Department official said, acknowledging the formidable wall of censorship in Russia, which has blocked access to Twitter and Facebook.

But some critics have suggested the US government needs to do more and aim to emulate the huge propaganda effort of the Cold War when significant resources were dedicated to pushing messaging toward the Soviet population.

Russian authorities have detained thousands of people protesting the war in Ukraine. A Russian state television journalist who interrupted a live news broadcast Monday holding a sign that said â€œNO WARâ€ was detained and fined about $270 but could still face prison time.

â€œThis is a real Achillesâ€™ heel for Putin,â€ James Clapper, who served as President Barack Obamaâ€™s director of national intelligence, told CNN. The US government, he said, should be using any social media platform available to bring images of dead Russian soldiers and prisoners of war to Russian citizens.

Several Russian prisoners of war have appeared at news conferences held by Ukrainian authorities. That may be a questionable practice under the Geneva Convention, which forbids states from causing unnecessary humiliation to prisoners of war.

â€œThis sort of thing lends itself to covert action on the part of the US government,â€ Clapper said. â€œAnd I trust and hope that we are doing something along those lines.â€

The US intelligence community is closely watching public opinion in Russia, but itâ€™s not clear whether there is any planning underway to conduct any form of clandestine information operations.

â€œWeâ€™re watching whatâ€™s happening in Russia,â€ said one Western source familiar with the intelligence, who added that it is not clear yet whether public opinion is breaking for or against the war.

There are less shadowy ways of supporting the free flow of information into Russia.

Alina Polyakova, president of the nonprofit Center for European Policy Analysis, said the State Departmentâ€™s Telegram account is â€œa step in the right direction, but frankly itâ€™s not creative enough.â€

Russians today donâ€™t appear to trust Western media or government officials as sources of information the way they did in the waning days of the Cold War, said Polyakova, who grew up in Kyiv in the 1980s.

â€œWe really need to be more creative about thinking who the right messengers are,â€ she added, pointing to the numerous journalists who have fled Russia in recent weeks as the Kremlin has criminalized independent reporting on the war in Ukraine.

Western governments and philanthropic organizations now have a â€œhuge opportunityâ€ to support these journalists as they will likely continue reporting from abroad and connecting with Russian audiences who trust them, Polyakova said.

â€˜We should bring real news to themâ€™

While the State Department lobs carefully worded messages to Russian citizens, a loose band of volunteer hackers from Ukraine and abroad are being more confrontational.

The so-called Ukrainian IT army, which Kyiv is actively encouraging, has looked to hack Russian news sites and post information about Russian casualties in Ukraine, according to Yegor Aushev, a Ukrainian cybersecurity executive who said he helped organize the hacking collective on behalf of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.

Russian citizens â€œdonâ€™t know a lot about whatâ€™s going on here,â€ Aushev said by phone from Ukraine. â€œThatâ€™s why we decided that one of the most important targets should be media. We should bring real news to them.â€

But reaching a Russian audience doesnâ€™t require breaking into a computer. Americans are among the many people who have sent text messages to Russians using a website built by an international group of volunteer programmers known as Squad303.

Stacey McCue, a Florida nurse, has sent roughly 100 text messages and hundreds of emails to Russians using the platform. She began personalizing the messages with her own voice, saying that Moscow has been lying to its citizens and that the war has killed civilians.

So far, McCue has gotten only three responses: â€œFâ€” off,â€ â€œCrimea is oursâ€ and one reply threatening to â€œforward your message to the appropriate authorities! Stop making such calls!â€

The hostile responses havenâ€™t deterred McCue.

â€œI think itâ€™s better to be proactive, to make a stand, even if itâ€™s a small thing to try to influence the overall situation,â€ she told CNN.

More high-profile Americans are joining the cause.

Schwarzenegger, the â€œTerminatorâ€ star and ex-California governor, addressed â€œthe Russian peopleâ€ in a video with Russian subtitles he posted Thursday to his 5 million Twitter followers and more than 19,000 Telegram subscribers.

â€œI hope that you will let me tell you the truth about the war in Ukraine and what is happening there,â€ Schwarzenegger said before detailing the Russian bombing of a Ukrainian maternity ward.

A source close to Schwarzenegger told CNN that the former bodybuilder made the video on his own accord and wasnâ€™t asked to do so by the US government.

But the State Department Telegram account wasted no time in sharing the video, and others in the information ecosystem followed suit.

Blake Ferrell, a plumber from Indiana, told CNN that he sent Schwarzeneggerâ€™s video to several Russians on Telegram, and still images of the actorâ€™s speech to other Russians via the Squad303 texting platform.

Ferrell hasnâ€™t received any replies yet, but he wants to keep trying to reach a Russian audience.

â€œFor me, itâ€™s the excitement of actually reaching another person,â€ he said.

9551,Did You Know Trumpâ€™s First Impeachment Was About Ukraine?,"Before Volodymyr Zelensky faced down Vladimir Putin, he stood up to another megalomaniac.

The first impeachment of President Trump is just over two years old, but it remains lost on many Americans that it was all about Ukraine. And not just about Ukraine in a generic sense, but specifically about Trump using Ukraineâ€™s vulnerability to Russia to pressure it to find dirt on the Bidens.

To force Ukraineâ€™s hand to his advantage, Trump thwarted longstanding U.S. policy to support and arm its ally in the face of the Russian threat. Zelensky didnâ€™t waver.

The saga of the first impeachment went down the memory hole quickly, overwhelmed by COVID-19, Trumpâ€™s efforts to subvert the 2020 election, and Bidenâ€™s win. But now, in a sense, weâ€™ve come full circle.

As Kyiv draws on stockpiles of American weaponry and bipartisan support today to defend against Vladimir Putinâ€™s attack, itâ€™s worth a brief refresher on how Trump threatened to and for a time did withhold that kind of support for his own personal political ends.

Where was Ukraine when Trump entered the picture?

Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election went a long way towards making the question of U.S. support for Ukraine not just a foreign policy issue, but a domestic political issue as well.

To counter the narrative that Russia was at least partly responsible for his victory, Trump argued that Ukraine had, in fact, intervened on the side of the Democrats while being in cahoots with Hillary Clinton.

There was zero evidence to support this. But it came as Ukraine struggled to strengthen itself. The country had undergone a revolution in 2014, after which Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a war in the countryâ€™s east. At the top of Ukraineâ€™s agenda was maintaining Western support for its government, military, and attempts to build the kinds of economic relations with the European Union that would allow it to drift away from Russia.

The U.S. had committed to giving Ukraine defense assistance, and its embassy in Kyiv â€“ via Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch â€“ had taken to openly pressuring government officials to take a tougher stance against graft.

After five years of war and disappointing progress in the fight against corruption, Ukrainians were exhausted with the government that was elected after the 2014 revolution. In March 2019, they elected a former comedian, Volodymyr Zelensky, who ran in part on a campaign to try to cut a deal with Vladimir Putin to end the war.

For that, he needed U.S. support.

What did Trump do?

Trump congratulated Zelensky on his victory in a July 2019 phone call, which would become central to the first impeachment.

On the call, Trump mentioned something else: he needed a favor.

Zelensky told Trump that Ukraine was â€œalmost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.â€

Javelins are the U.S.-made and exported anti-tank missile system that have been extremely effective in Ukraineâ€™s defense against Russia.

Trump replied: â€œI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.â€

Trump then launched into a discussion of various conspiracy theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election, suggesting to Zelensky that the countryâ€™s law enforcement needed to â€œget to the bottom of thatâ€ and â€œfind out aboutâ€ Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden who took a job on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.

Within weeks, nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid that had been scheduled to go to Ukraine had been frozen. Multiple Ukrainian and U.S. officials would later report that various Trump cronies had pressured the Ukrainian government in various ways to produce dirt on the Bidens to get the hold lifted.

How did that lead to his impeachment?

A whistleblower from the National Security Council came forward in August 2019 about the call. After a clumsy attempt by the Trump administration to suppress the tip, it came out: Trump had used the power of American foreign policy for his personal political benefit, trying to extort Ukraine into manufacturing dirt about his opponent in exchange for military aid that the country was already supposed to get.

The House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry in September. Public hearings and depositions with Trump administration officials throughout the fall revealed the scope of the scandal: multiple senior Trump administration officials had been involved in the effort, which stretched far beyond the July 2019 phone call.

The investigation revealed other instances of pressure. Trump had ordered Vice President Mike Pence, for example, to blow off attending Zelenskyâ€™s inauguration in May 2019.

Months afterward, after the July phone call, Trump had Pence tell the Ukrainians that military aid would not be forthcoming until the United States saw more action on corruption. By that point, multiple Trump administration officials had taken to use â€œcorruptionâ€ as a byword for investigations into the Bidens.

Rudy Giuliani, Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer, had gotten involved in U.S. foreign policy, trying to press Ukrainian officials into opening investigations into Hunter Biden and his father, the frontrunner in the Democratic primary at the time.

Giuliani, along with Ukraine-born associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, had also sought to remove Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv.

The impeachment investigation, along with a federal criminal campaign finance case against Parnas and Fruman, alleged that that took place at the direction of a Ukrainian official. Texts released by Parnas suggested that this was Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor general, who the ambassador had criticized, and who offered a deal: In exchange for Yovanovitchâ€™s firing, he would announce investigations into Hunter and Joe Biden.

What were the consequences for Ukraine?

The hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid â€“ some of it of the kind that has proved decisive in Ukraineâ€™s defense against Russiaâ€™s invasion â€“ was eventually released.

Since then, Ukraine has continued to receive more military aid from the U.S. in the form of anti-tank weapons, small arms, and other items.

Some of those U.S. officials involved in pushing Trumpâ€™s â€œdrug deal,â€ as John Bolton called it, are still involved in policy discussions. Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to the region, is out of government, but regularly opines on Ukraine-related issues, even after having been forced to substantially change his congressional testimony.

The long-lasting damage has been less tangible, but arguably more important: American unity to support Ukraine, and Zelenskyâ€™s political agenda.

On the latter, Zelensky ran on a campaign of negotiating with Putin to find a deal. Ukrainian officials needed political support from the United States and, instead, got demands to investigate Hunter Biden.

On the former, old-school establishment Republicans do still back U.S. support for Ukraine. But the MAGA right, along with acolytes like Tucker Carlson, do not, portraying the country as a needless waste of resources while making bizarre comparisons to the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump himself this week showed willingness to do the same thing again.

â€œHow is it that the mayor of Moscow, his wife gave the Biden family three and a half million dollars?â€ Trump told John Solomon. â€œI think Putin now would be willing to probably give that answer. Iâ€™m sure he knows.â€",https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/did-you-know-trumps-first-impeachment-was-about-ukraine,Neutral
1324,Ignored Warnings: How NATO Expansion Led to the Ukraine Tragedy,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attends a press conference after a NATO video summit on Russia invasion of Ukraine at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Feb. 25, 2022. (Photo credit: KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/AFP via Getty Images)

NATO Expansion â€“ The Trigger for Russiaâ€™s Attack on Ukraine? â€“ Russiaâ€™s military offensive against Ukraine is an act of aggression that will make already worrisome tensions between NATO and Moscow even more dangerous. The Westâ€™s new cold war with Russia has turned hot. Vladimir Putin bears primary responsibility for this latest development, but NATOâ€™s arrogant, tone-deaf policy toward Russia over the past quarter-century deserves a large share as well.

Analysts committed to a U.S. foreign policy of realism and restraint have warned for more than a quarter-century that continuing to expand the most powerful military alliance in history toward another major power would not end well. The war in Ukraine provides definitive confirmation that it did not.

Thinking Through the Ukraine Crisis â€“ the Causes

â€œIt would be extraordinarily difficult to expand NATO eastward without that action being viewed by Russia as unfriendly. Even the most modest schemes would bring the alliance to the borders of the old Soviet Union. Some of the more ambitious versions would have the alliance virtually surround the Russian Federation itself.â€ Beyond NATO: Staying Out of Europeâ€™s Wars (p. 45). I wrote those words in 1994, at a time when expansion proposals merely constituted occasional speculation in foreign policy seminars in New York City and Washington, D.C. I added that expansion â€œwould constitute a needless provocation of Russia.â€

What was not publicly known at the time was that Bill Clintonâ€™s administration had already made the fateful decision the previous year to push for including some former Warsaw Pact countries in NATO. The administration would soon propose inviting Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to become members, and the U.S. Senate approved adding those countries to the North Atlantic Treaty in 1998. It would be the first of several waves of membership expansion.

Even that first stage provoked Russian opposition and anger. In her memoir, Clintonâ€™s secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, concedes that â€œ[Russian President Boris] Yeltsin and his countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement, seeing it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability and moving Europeâ€™s dividing line to the east, leaving them isolated.â€ Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott similarly described the Russian attitude: â€œMany Russians see NATO as a vestige of the cold war, inherently directed against their country. They point out that they have disbanded the Warsaw Pact, their military alliance, and ask why the West should not do the same.â€ It was an excellent question, and neither the Clinton Administration nor its successors provided even a remotely convincing answer.

George Kennan, the intellectual father of Americaâ€™s containment policy during the Cold War, perceptively warned in a May 2, 1998 New York Times interview about what the Senateâ€™s ratification of NATOâ€™s first round of expansion would set in motion.

â€I think it is the beginning of a new cold war,â€ Kennan stated. â€I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else.â€

He was right, but U.S. and NATO leaders proceeded with new rounds of expansion, including the provocative step of adding the three Baltic republics. Those countries not only had been part of the Soviet Union, but they had also been part of Russiaâ€™s empire during the Czarist era. That wave of expansion now had NATO perched on the border of the Russian Federation.

Moscowâ€™s patience with NATOâ€™s ever more intrusive behavior was wearing thin. The last reasonably friendly warning from Russia that the alliance needed to back off came in March 2007, when Putin addressed the annual Munich Security Conference. â€œNATO has put its frontline forces on our borders,â€ Putin complained. NATO expansion â€œrepresents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended? And what happened to the assurances our western partners made after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact?â€

In his memoir, ""Duty,"" Robert M. Gates, who served as secretary of defense in the administrations of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, stated his belief that â€œthe relationship with Russia had been badly mismanaged after [George H.W.] Bush left office in 1993.â€ Among other missteps, â€œU.S. agreements with the Romanian and Bulgarian governments to rotate troops through bases in those countries was a needless provocation.â€ In an implicit rebuke to the younger Bush, Gates asserted that â€œtrying to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO was truly overreaching.â€ That move, he contended, was a case of â€œrecklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their own vital national interests.â€

The following year, the Kremlin demonstrated that its discontent with NATOâ€™s continuing incursions into Russiaâ€™s security zone had moved beyond verbal objections. Moscow exploited a foolish provocation by Georgiaâ€™s pro-Western government to launch a military offensive that brought Russian troops to the outskirts of the capital. Thereafter, Russia permanently detached two secessionist-minded Georgian regions and put them under effective Russian control.

Western (especially U.S.) leaders continued to blow through red warning light after red warning light, however. The Obama Administrationâ€™s shockingly arrogant meddling in Ukraineâ€™s internal political affairs in 2013 and 2014 to help demonstrators overthrow Ukraineâ€™s elected, proâ€â€‹Russia president was the single most brazen provocation, and it caused tensions to spike. Moscow immediately responded by seizing and annexing Crimea, and a new cold war was underway with a vengeance.

Could the Ukraine Crisis Have Been Avoided?

Events during the past few months constituted the last chance to avoid a hot war in Eastern Europe. Putin demanded that NATO provide guarantees on several security issues. Specifically, the Kremlin wanted binding assurances that the alliance would reduce the scope of its growing military presence in Eastern Europe and would never offer membership to Ukraine. He backed up those demands with a massive military buildup on Ukraineâ€™s borders. The Biden Administrationâ€™s response to Russiaâ€™s quest for meaningful Western concessions and security guarantees was tepid and evasive. Putin then clearly decided to escalate matters. Washingtonâ€™s attempt to make Ukraine a NATO political and military pawn (even absent the countryâ€™s formal membership in the alliance) may end up costing the Ukrainian people dearly.

The Ukraine Tragedy

History will show that Washingtonâ€™s treatment of Russia in the decades following the demise of the Soviet Union was a policy blunder of epic proportions. It was entirely predictable that NATO expansion would ultimately lead to a tragic, perhaps violent, breach of relations with Moscow. Perceptive analysts warned of the likely consequences, but those warnings went unheeded. We are now paying the price for the U.S. foreign policy establishmentâ€™s myopia and arrogance.

7510,Sanctions vs. neutrality: Swiss fine-tune response to Russia,"GENEVA (AP) â€” Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine has put Switzerlandâ€™s much-vaunted neutrality to the test â€” and along with it, the countryâ€™s traditional role as international intermediary and reputation as a safe haven for the assets of Russiaâ€™s richest and most powerful.

The Swiss executive branch stopped short of announcing unilateral sanctions against Russian interests after Moscowâ€™s blistering military action in Ukraine. Instead, the Federal Council opted to fall in line with the European Union and pledge that Russian individuals and companies hit with EU sanctions wonâ€™t be able to evade them in Switzerland, which is not one of the EUâ€™s 27 member states.

The government said Friday that financial â€œintermediariesâ€ in Switzerland were now banned from starting new business relationships with 363 Russian people and four Russian companies. Any existing business must be reported to the Swiss economic affairs secretariat. Further steps are under consideration.

While hardly a crackdown compared to other Western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, the impact could be felt. The rich Alpine nation has been the biggest recipient of transactions by Russian private individuals â€” ahead of Britain, Spain, Luxembourg and the United States, according to a report compiled by the Swiss Embassy in Moscow.

â€œSwitzerland has for years been by far the most important destination worldwide for rich Russians to manage their wealth,â€ the report said, adding that net transfers of Russian taxpayers to Switzerland totaled $2.5 billion in 2020. The Swiss news agency SDA-ATS reported net transfers of $1.8 billion in the first half of 2021.

Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin, the head of the federal economic affairs department, noted that Switzerland was bound to follow U.N. sanctions but could decide whether to follow EU sanctions based on criteria such as foreign policy and legal aspects â€” including legislation that has enshrined â€œneutralityâ€ into Swiss law.

Swiss authorities are in essence extending measures set up in 2014 after Russiaâ€™s takeover of Crimea, in which they also sought to ensure that EU sanctions were not dodged in Switzerland, to hundreds more people and businesses â€” but going further.

â€œSwitzerland is thus taking a tougher line with regard to Russia,â€ Parmelin told reporters in Bern, the capital.

German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Friday that â€œevery country decides in a sovereign way about its actions â€¦ If you were to ask me whether Iâ€™d be happy if Switzerland supported the (EU) sanctions, then Iâ€™d clearly say â€˜yesâ€™.â€

However, Switzerland is also anxious to safeguard its role as diplomatic go-between for some countries â€” one of which is Russia. The Swiss government represents the interests of the former Soviet republic of Georgia in Moscow and Russiaâ€™s interests in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, under an arrangement set up after those two countries broke off bilateral ties during their conflict in 2008.

â€œItâ€™s important to the Federal Council that implementing these measures doesnâ€™t cut off talks between Switzerland and the countries affected,â€ said Parmelin. â€œSwitzerland wants to be able to offer its services to the countries in conflict if these countries wish.â€

â€œIf Switzerland were to automatically adopt the sanctions imposed by the EU or other countries, it could no longer credibly play the traditional role for which it is valued worldwide,â€ he added.

The respected Swiss daily Tages Anzeiger reported Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked his Swiss counterpart on Saturday to act as a neutral mediator between Ukraine and Russia, and help work toward a cease-fire between the two countries, notably in the context of a Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva opening Monday. The Swiss Foreign Ministry did not confirm any such communication.

Geneva hosted a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden in June, as well as a couple of bilateral meetings in recent weeks as tensions brewed over Ukraine. The Swiss relish their role and reputation as a skilled, neutral host for such international gatherings and as a hub for international organizations like the United Nations and the international Red Cross in Geneva.

The push-and-pull felt by the Swiss could grow. Some Western countries announced or were preparing individual sanctions against Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, including possible travel bans. Switzerland is unlikely to go that far: Lavrov himself is expected to be on hand in Geneva on Tuesday for a session of the Human Rights Council.

Economic concerns â€” not just the political neutrality that is enshrined in Swiss law â€” could also figure into the Swiss calculations.

Geneva is a major hub for commodities trading like oil and wheat that matter to Russia and Ukraine, and is reported to be a favored stomping ground for Russian oligarchs and other economic elites drawn to low-tax and privacy-minded banks and policies in Switzerland.

The June report by the Swiss Embassy in Moscow said roughly 80 percent of Russiaâ€™s commodities trade goes through the Swiss financial services centers of Geneva, Zug, Lugano and Zurich. Major Russian energy and commodities firms have offices in Switzerland.

According to the Bank of International Settlements, Russian deposits in Swiss financial institutions totaled the equivalent of nearly $11 billion at the end of the third quarter last year. That represented about 30 percent of the total Russian deposits overseas of nearly $36 billion, according to BIS figures.

â€œRussian invaders fired on and damaged Holocaust Memorial in Drobitsky Yar on the outskirts of Kharkiv. The Nazis have returned. Exactly 80 years later,â€ the ministry stated.

The memorial is one of many civilian structures the Russians have hit since the beginning of the invasion.

Russia has falsely peddled that it is aiming for the â€œdenazificationâ€ of Ukraineâ€™s government. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and has said three of his family members died during World War II.

â€œ#Russia continues to attack not only the civilian population of #Ukraine but also the places of remembrance. Russians shelled another Holocaust memorial,â€ Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv tweeted.

â€œThis time, Russian artillery damaged the Menorah monument in Drobytsky Yar near Kharkiv,â€ it added.

Earlier during the war, a television tower near the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial site was hit in an attack that killed five people, although there is no evidence the Russians purposely aimed for the center, NBC News reported.

6124,Now Is the Time for Nonalignment and Peace,"By Independent Media Institute

War is an ugly part of the human experience. Everything about it is hideous. War is most obviously the act of invasion and the brutality that goes along with its operations. No war is precise; every war hurts civilians. Each act of bombardment sends a neurological shudder through a society.

By Roger McKenzie and Vijay Prashad

World War II demonstrated this ugliness in the Holocaust and in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From Hiroshima and the Holocaust rose two mighty movements, one for peace and against the perils of further nuclear attacks, and the other for an end to the divisions of humanity and for a nonalignment from these divisions. The Stockholm Appeal of 1950, signed by 300 million people, called for an absolute ban on nuclear weapons. Five years later, 29 countries from Africa and Asia, representing 54 percent of the worldâ€™s population, gathered in Bandung, Indonesia, to sign a 10-point pledge against war and for the â€œpromotion of mutual interests and cooperation.â€ The Bandung Spirit was for peace and for nonalignment, for the peoples of the world to put their efforts into building a process to eradicate historyâ€™s burdens (illiteracy, ill health, hunger) by using their social wealth. Why spend money on nuclear weapons when money should be spent on classrooms and hospitals?

Despite the major gains of many of the new nations that had emerged out of colonialism, the overwhelming force of the older colonial powers prevented the Bandung Spirit from defining human history. Instead, the civilization of war prevailed. This civilization of war is revealed in the massive waste of human wealth in the production of armed forcesâ€”sufficient to destroy hundreds of planetsâ€”and the use of these armed forces as the first instinct to settle disputes. Since the 1950s, the battlefield of these ambitions has not been in Europe or in North America, but rather it has been in Africa, Asia, and Latin Americaâ€”areas of the world where old colonial sensibilities believe that human life is less important. This international division of humanityâ€”which says that a war in Yemen is normal, whereas a war in Ukraine is horrificâ€”defines our time. There are 40 wars taking place across the globe; there needs to be political will to fight to end each of these, not just those that are taking place within Europe. The Ukrainian flag is ubiquitous in the West; what are the colors of the Yemeni flag, of the Sahrawi flag, and of the Somali flag?

Return to Peace, Return to Nonalignment

We are overwhelmed these days with certainties that seem less and less real. As Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine continues, there is a baffling view that negotiations are futile. This view circulates even when reasonable people agree that all wars must end in negotiations. If that is the case, then why not call for an immediate ceasefire and build the trust necessary for negotiations? Negotiations are only feasible if there is respect on all sides, and if there is an attempt to understand that all sides in a military conflict have reasonable demands. To wit, to paint this war as the whims of Russian President Vladimir Putin is part of the exercise of permanent war. Security guarantees for Ukraine are necessary; but so are security guarantees for Russia, which would include a return to a serious international arms control regime.

Peace does not come merely because we wish for it. It requires a fight in the trenches of ideas and institutions. The political forces in power profit from war, and so they clothe themselves in machismo to better represent the arms dealers who want more war, not less. These people in the blue suits of bureaucracy are not to be trusted with the worldâ€™s future. They fail us when it comes to the climate catastrophe; they fail us when it comes to the pandemic; they fail us when it comes to peacemaking. We need to summon up the old spirits of peace and nonalignment and bring these to life inside mass movements that are the only hope of this planet.

It is not merely sentimental to reach back to the past to breathe life into the Non-Aligned Movement of today. Already the contradictions of the present have raised the specter of nonalignment in parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Most of these countries voted against the condemnation of Russia not because they support Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine, but rather because they recognize that polarization is a fatal error. What is needed is an alternative to the two-camp world of the Cold War. That is the reason why many of the leaders of these countriesâ€”from Chinaâ€™s Xi Jinping to Indiaâ€™s Narendra Modi to South Africaâ€™s Cyril Ramaphosaâ€”have called, despite their very different political orientations, for a departure from the â€œCold War mentality.â€ They are already walking toward a new nonaligned platform. It is this actual movement of history that provokes us to reflect on a return to the concepts of nonalignment and peace.

Nobody wants to imagine the full implications of the encirclement of China and Russia by the United States and its allies. Even countries that are closely allied with the United Statesâ€”such as Germany and Japanâ€”recognize that if a new iron curtain descends around China and Russia, it would be fatal for their own countries. Already, the war and sanctions have created serious political crises in Honduras, Pakistan, Peru, and Sri Lanka, with others to follow as food and fuel prices rise astronomically. War is too expensive for the poorer nations. Spending for war is eating into the human spirit, and warfare itself increases peopleâ€™s general sense of despair.

The warmakers are idealists. Their wars do not settle the major dilemmas of humanity. The ideas of nonalignment and peace, on the other hand, are realistic; their framework has answers to the children who want to eat and to learn, to play and to dream.

7860,"'MEET WITH ME OR GET OUT OF MY COUNTRY': Zelenskyy Calls Out Putin, 'What Are You Afraid Of?'","Zelenskyy is calling Putin out.

According to a report from the Associated Press, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to sit down and talk things out.

â€œGood Lord, what do you want? Leave our land. If you donâ€™t want to leave now, sit down with me at the negotiating table,â€ Zelenskyy said. â€œBut not from 30 meters away, like with Macron and Scholz. Sit down with me and talk. What are you afraid of? Weâ€™re no threat to anyone.â€

The â€œ30 metersâ€ jab is a reference to Putinâ€™s comically large table (seen below):

â€œI donâ€™t bite. What are you afraid of?â€ Zelenskyy added, according to the Associated Press. â€œAny words are more important than shots.â€

â€œ[Zelenskyy also] said the world was too slow to offer support for Ukraine and prodded Western leaders to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to deny access to the Russian warplanes.

2014,RT America Shutters After â€˜Unforeseen Business Interruption Eventsâ€™,"Russia-backed news outlet RT America reportedly ceased productions and laid off most of its staff, according to a memo from T&R Productions, the production company behind the Russian state-funded network, obtained by CNN on Thursday.

In a memo to staff, Misha Solodovnikov, the general manager of T&R Productions, reportedly said that the Russia-backed outlet will be â€œceasing productionâ€ at all of its locations â€œas a result of unforeseen business interruption events.â€

â€œUnfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&R employees at all locations,â€ Solodovnikov wrote, according to CNN.

T&R Productions operated offices in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC. It also operates multiple networks worldwide.

The development marks an effective end to RT America, which served as a mouthpiece for Russian President Vladimir Putin in the U.S. The shuttering of RT America follows news of the network being dropped by major satellite carrier DirecTV earlier this week. Roku, which was one of two television providers that carried the outlet, also joined DirecTV in booting RT America from its global platform this week.

In recent days, RTâ€™s reach has significantly decreased as a result of technology companies and television providers cutting ties with the Russia-backed outlet in light of Russiaâ€™s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Internal turmoil also emerged within RT, with several employees in RTâ€™s various networks announcing their resignations.

In an email obtained by CNN, RT America employees based in the outletâ€™s Washington, D.C. bureau were informed on Wednesday that an all-staff meeting was scheduled on Thursday afternoon.

Solodovnikov officially announced the ceasing of RT Americaâ€™s operations to staffers in person during the Thursday afternoon meeting.

An attendee told CNN that the meeting lasted â€œabout two minutes,â€ with Solodovnikov informing staff that they would be given two months worth of severance pay.

Another attendee reportedly described the meeting as â€œsomber,â€ with many staffers â€œshockedâ€ and â€œcrying.â€™

RT America previously registered as an agent of a foreign government with the Justice Department in 2017, following years of accusations that the outlet served as a propaganda arm of the Russian government.

The DOJ directed RT to register as a foreign agent partly because of an intelligence community report that alleged the outlet aided Moscowâ€™s effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.",https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/russia-rt-america-shutters-ukraine-invasion,Neutral

LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Sainsbury's has removed from sale all products that are 100% sourced from Russia in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it said on Friday.

It said from Friday it will no longer sell two products â€“ Russian Standard vodka and Karpayskiye black sunflower seeds. On Thursday, the Co-operative and Morrisons both de-listed Russian Standard vodka.

Sainsbury's also said it will re-name ""Chicken Kiev"" to ""Chicken Kyiv"".

4560,China reaches out to Asian neighbours after Ukraine war causes further tensions with US,"With the Ukraine crisis putting further strain on China's ties with the United States and the West as a whole, Beijing has set its eyes on mending fences with its neighbours.

China's diplomatic frenzy in the past two weeks shows the importance of its neighbours in Beijing's hierarchy of relations, according to observers.

On the heels of a whirlwind tour of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nepal, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last week hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who travelled abroad for the first time since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Wang also chaired an Afghanistan-focused meeting attended by the foreign ministers from Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

The Taliban's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaki and the US special envoy on Afghanistan also attended the talks in Anhui province on Wednesday.

Highlighting China's ambitions towards Afghanistan following America's chaotic withdrawal last summer, President Xi Jinping sent a written message, pledging Beijing's continued support for the radical Islamic group and the war-torn country, which he said stood at a ""critical point of transition from chaos to order"".

China also welcomed foreign ministers from Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar and Indonesia, which holds this year's Group of 20 presidency, last week and took part in a virtual summit with the European Union in Brussels on Friday.

Friday's visit by Myanmar foreign minster U Wunna Maung Lwin, was the first to a non-Asean country since the coup that brought the ruling junta to power last February and Wang told his counterpart that China was ready to help the country address its economic problems, which have been compounded by the war in Ukraine.

Story continues

Xi has also weighed in personally on Beijing's efforts to rally support from its neighbours and developing countries, talking to leaders from Cambodia, Indonesia and South Africa over the phone recently.

In a rare move, he also reached out to South Korea's president-elect Yoon Suk-yeol twice, including a telephone conversation a day after the election, even though Yoon is strongly pro-US and has promised to take a tougher stance towards China.

While China started its pivot to Asia after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic over two years ago, analysts said its recent moves are largely a response to Washington's Indo-Pacific strategy, a perceived US containment strategy towards Beijing.

""China has always attached importance and invested heavily in forging ties with its neighbours over the years.

""Now with Washington making headway in the Indo-Pacific region especially in geopolitical and security terms, Beijing has to ramp up its efforts to shore up and consolidate ties with its peripheral region,"" said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor at Nanyang Technological University's S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Last week US President Joe Biden told the visiting Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong that the Ukraine crisis would not distract Washington from implementing its Indo-Pacific strategy.

Although a planned White House summit for the leaders of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has been postponed because of ""scheduling problems"", Biden said he wanted to ensure that the region remains ""free and open"", without specifically naming China.

""From China's perspective, the growing US involvement in the Indo-Pacific and the resulting changes to the regional geopolitical landscape are alarming,"" Li said.

""Washington's ability to garner a united front with Europe and Nato on Ukraine and strengthen its alliances in the region, such as the four-way grouping of the Quad comprising Japan, Australia and India, remains a top challenge for China.""

According to a survey by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore early this year, Washington has gained ground against Beijing in their competition for influence in Southeast Asia over the past year.

In recent weeks, Washington has tried to lure Nepal, a traditional buffer between China and India with an infrastructure grant project while exerting pressure on India over its refusal to denounce Russia, New Delhi's top weapons supplier.

Wang made surprise visits to both India and Nepal last week despite the two countries' ongoing territorial disputes with China.

""At a time of increasing great power competition, which has been exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it makes sense for China to go into diplomatic overdrive, especially given the US efforts to rally countries against Russia,"" said Benoit Hardy-Chartrand, an international affairs specialist at Temple University in Tokyo.

He noted the importance of regional diplomacy was not new for Beijing, as it has long valued stability close to its borders and been working to strengthen its influence on its periphery.

China's periphery - and Southeast Asia in particular - has long been a locus of great power competition between China, the US, and even Japan, according to Hardy-Chartrand.

Tensions between the US and China persist and a video meeting between Xi and Biden did little to alter the situation.

The US continues to use sanctions and other measures to target Chinese firms and offiicals over China's human rights record and US national security concerns, while Beijing blames Washington for a failure to improve ties.

Despite the crisis in Ukraine, Washington has continued to focus on the competition with China and warned Beijing will face ""consequences"" if it supports Russia's invasion.

But analysts said Asian countries' reaction to Russia's attack was also an opportunity for China.

While most of these countries voted to denounce Moscow's invasion at the United Nations last month, Singapore is the only one in Southeast Asia to join the Western sanctions against Russia, the region's top arms supplier.

Huang Jing, director of the Institute of the US and Pacific Studies at Shanghai International Studies University, said while two UN resolutions condemning Russia won overwhelming support from over 140 countries, it did not mean they agreed with the Western sanctions.

""With Washington's attention and resources diverted from the China-focused Indo-Pacific Strategy to the Ukraine crisis, it presents some good opportunities for China to ramp up its influence,"" he said.

He said Beijing should seize on the opening, especially India's resentment about pressure from Western countries over its close defence ties with Russia, to pull it away from the Quad.

""While it is almost impossible to fully repair China's ties with India, Beijing's priority should be to prevent New Delhi siding with Washington in the US-China rivalry and the formation of 'an Asian Nato' in the Indo-Pacific,"" he said, referring to Beijing's categorisation of the Quad.

Huang also said it was natural for Beijing to shift its focus onto its Asian neighbours, considering the decline in US-China ties and hardening bipartisan consensus in Washington.

Biden's framing of the US-China rivalry as a ""battle between democracy and autocracy"" has also left no doubt for leaders in Beijing about the prospect for future relations.

Monika Chansoria, a senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs in Tokyo, said: ""The renewed preoccupation of an overstretched US with European security has seemingly provided Beijing the strategic space to realign the global world order in order to meet its own strategic targets, most importantly, Taiwan.""

But she said Wang's trip to India, initiated from the Chinese side, had failed to yield tangible results and was ""an failed attempt by Beijing to begin portraying that it's back to 'business as usual'"" with India following a deadly border clash in the Galwan valley two years ago.

""China's peripheral region senses the looming threat of China trying to unilaterally change the status quo in the East and South China Seas,"" Chansoria said. ""The region is wary of Beijing's predatory expansionism that spreads across small, lesser-developed nations in dire need of developmental aid and assistance.""

Hardy-Chartrand also said it is unclear whether China can overcome ""notable obstacles"" - including Asean's insistence on strategic autonomy, Yoon's pro-US stance and ongoing tensions with Japan - to strengthen its influence.

""One of the most significant challenges is that most countries are reluctant to see China become a regional hegemon and continue to want a strong American presence in the region,"" he said.

5229,Russia's ambassador to the U.S. says he hasn't talked to Putin since 2017,"Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the United States, hasn't spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin at all since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. In fact, the last time Antonov spoke directly to Putin was in 2017, just before he was dispatched to Washington, D.C., Politico reported Monday.

When asked about his lack of contact with Putin, Antonov told Politico, ""I have had enough conversations with senior officials in the Kremlin, in various agencies."" Russia, he said, has ""a different system."" And besides, talking with Putin on the phone would only ""give an opportunity to FBI to listen to everything what Mr. Putin could say [to] me.""

Since the invasion began, Antonov has also found himself increasingly isolated in Washington. ""I don't think anyone really thinks he's a proxy for Moscow,"" former National Security Council official Gavin Wilde told Politico.

In the interview, Antonov dutifully followed Kremlin talking points, referring to the invasion as a ""special military operation,"" parroting concerns about Nazis in Ukraine, and decrying ""Russophobia."" He also said that he believes Ukraine ""has a right to be [a] sovereign country"" but that he doesn't ""know what will be in the future.""",https://theweek.com/russia/1012668/russias-ambassador-to-the-us-says-he-hasnt-talked-to-putin-since-2017,Neutral
4090,8 takeaways from Bidenâ€™s trip to Europe,"By Maegan Vazquez and Kyle Feldscher, CNN

President Joe Biden used a last-minute trip to Europe this week to rally the worldâ€™s democracies and announce more actions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, while also causing a geopolitical stir with one of the final lines from his speech in Poland.

The Presidentâ€™s four-day stint began in Brussels, where he attended snap summits and held bilateral meetings with other world leaders. Biden then traveled to Poland, where he met with American troops stationed just west of Ukraine, spoke with humanitarian workers and refugees, and held talks with Polish President Andrzej Duda. It ended with what will become one of the signature speeches of the Presidentâ€™s career as he evoked European history to make the case for democracy and said Russian President Vladimir Putin â€œcannot remain in power,â€ a seismic statement that the White House quickly tried to downplay.

Throughout his visit, Biden sought to reinforce his broad-reaching foreign policy framework, discussing his heartbreak about the humanitarian crisis at hand and telling American troops in Poland that they were â€œin the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs.â€

The trip was a test of what the United States could do to rally alliances following years of absent leadership, proving to also be an assessment of just how much the Western alliances can achieve when they are fully united.

Here are eight takeaways from Bidenâ€™s visit to Belgium and Poland:

Biden says Putin â€˜cannot remain in powerâ€™

At the end of his address from Warsaw, capping off his trip, Biden made a major declaration that quickly sent shock waves across Europe and through the White House press office.

â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, this man cannot remain in power,â€ Biden announced at the very conclusion of a capstone address delivered outside the Royal Castle in Warsaw.

For a few moments, it appeared to be a clear call for regime change in Russia, and the Kremlin reacted quickly to the Presidentâ€™s words, with Putinâ€™s spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying, â€œThis is not to be decided by Mr. Biden. It should only be a choice of the people of the Russian Federation.â€

However, before Bidenâ€™s plane had taken off for Washington, the White House was already downplaying the comments. A White House official said Biden wasnâ€™t referencing regime change when he said Putin â€œcannot remain in power.â€

â€œThe Presidentâ€™s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putinâ€™s power in Russia, or regime change,â€ a White House official said.

It was a response that attempted to put the Presidentâ€™s speech in line with larger US policy. American officials had said previously that removing Putin from power was not their goal.

â€œFor us, itâ€™s not about regime change. The Russian people have to decide who they want to lead them,â€ Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month.

A separate White House official told CNN after the speech that the line was not in Bidenâ€™s prepared remarks.

White House forced to clean up multiple other Biden comments that raised eyebrows

The line at the end of Bidenâ€™s speech in Warsaw will be the one that is longest remembered, but it was not the only time that the White House needed to clarify some of the Presidentâ€™s remarks during his four-day swing through Europe.

On Thursday, during a news conference in Brussels, Biden said the United States would respond â€œin kindâ€ if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine. When asked by a reporter on Friday if that meant the US would use chemical weapons on Russia, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States had â€œno intention of using chemical weapons period â€” under any circumstance.â€

Asked about Bidenâ€™s comments, Sullivan said the President also said the United States would respond â€œaccordingly.â€

Sullivan added, â€œMeaning we will elect the form and nature of our response based on the nature of the action Russia takes, and weâ€™ll do so in coordination with our allies, and weâ€™ve communicated to the Russians as the President said publicly a couple of weeks ago that there will be a severe price if Russia uses chemical weapons, and I wont go beyond that other (than) to say, â€˜The United States has no intention of using chemical weapons period under any circumstances.'â€

On Friday in Poland, Biden made an apparent slip by suggesting the US troops he was speaking to would see Ukrainians in action. Biden has made clear that US troops will not fight in Ukraine, and his remark did not appear to be anything other than a slip.

â€œThe average citizen, look at how theyâ€™re stepping up. And youâ€™re going to see when youâ€™re there, I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve been there, youâ€™re going to see women, young people, standing in the middle of the damn tank, saying â€˜Iâ€™m not leaving. Iâ€™m holding my groundâ€™,â€ Biden said.

A White House spokesperson responded to the comment, saying, â€œThe President has been clear we are not sending U.S. troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.â€

Biden warns the worldâ€™s democracies that a time is coming for resolve and unity

The end of the Warsaw speech will be the most memorable line from an address that widely called for democracies to steel themselves against the threat of autocracies in the years and decades to come. Biden has often said that the defining battle of the coming era is democracy versus rising autocracies, and he said Ukraine was the front line in that fight.

Biden, standing along NATOâ€™s eastern edge, in Poland, issued a stern warning during his speech, telling Putin: â€œDonâ€™t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.â€ He said the US was committed to the collective protection obligations laid out in NATOâ€™s charter â€œwith the full force of our collective power.â€

In a message to the Poles and other NATO allies, Biden used a Cold War-era cry from the late Polish-born Pope John Paul II to rally a nation facing new threats.

â€œBe not afraid,â€ Biden said.

â€œNothing about that battle for freedom was simple or easy. It was a long, painful slog, fought over not days and months but years and decades,â€ Biden told the crowd in Warsaw. â€œWe emerged anew in a great battle for freedom, a battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression.â€

He said the same lessons must be applied to the current threat from Russia.

â€œThis battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead,â€ Biden said.

Biden announces new sanctions and measures to help Ukrainian refugees

Much like other leaders at the summits, Biden used his meetings on Thursday and Friday to announce a slew of new actions aimed at punishing Russia and aiding Ukrainians.

On Thursday, his administration issued sanctions against hundreds of Russian politicians, business leaders and defense companies. The new restrictions target 328 members of the 450-seat Russian State Duma, the lower house of the two-tiered Russian Parliament, and cut off 48 Russian defense and materiel companies from Western technology and financing. The US also sanctioned Herman Gref â€” the head of Sberbank â€” who has worked with Putin since the 1990s, when both men worked in the mayorâ€™s office of St. Petersburg.

The US also put sanctions on longtime Putin associate Gennady Timchenko â€” his companies, family members and yacht â€” as well as 17 board members of Russian financial institution Sovcombank, according to the White House.

Biden announced that the US will accept up to 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine, with an emphasis n protecting the most vulnerable among the refugee populations, including members of the LGBTQ community, those with medical needs, journalists and third-country nationals. A senior administration official said a â€œfull range of legal pathwaysâ€ would be utilized to welcome the refugees.

On Friday, Biden and his counterpart at the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, unveiled a joint task force aimed at weaning Europe off its dependence on Russian oil and gas. The panel is aimed at finding alternative supplies of liquified natural gas and reducing overall demand for natural gas moving forward.

The United States will work toward supplying Europe with at least 15 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas in 2022, in partnership with other nations, the White House said.

Russia hits Lviv with airstrikes after days of Western allies meetings on the war

After days of Western allies meeting and talking about how to punish Putin and Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military appeared to send a message to Biden with an airstrike on a fuel depot in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.

Lviv is the city to which many displaced Ukrainians have fled and is where many Western media outlets have made their home base to cover the war. While Russian military officials said that they intended to focus their campaign in the disputed eastern parts of Ukraine, the attack on Lviv was conspicuously timed, coming just before Biden was to speak in Warsaw, about 200 miles away in Poland.

Russian military officials also used the trip as a moment to put their own spin on how the conflict is going. Russian Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy on Friday claimed that Russian forces had encircled cities around Ukraine in a deliberate effort to tie down Ukrainian forces and prevent them from focusing on the separatist regions of Donbas before Russia â€œliberatesâ€ them. Putin has stated that the goal of the conflict is the complete demilitarization of the country and has said that the war is going according to plan.

However, Russian forces have incurred serious losses. And military analysts and observers say Russian advances appear to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities, such as Kyiv and Kharkiv.

Following world leadersâ€™ meetings in Brussels, Putin said in a videoconference with workers of arts and literature on Friday that the West was trying to â€œcancelâ€ Russia.

â€œJ.K. Rowling has recently been canceled because she â€¦ did not please the fans of the so-called gender freedoms,â€ Putin, who has railed against transgender and gay rights, said, referring to the â€œHarry Potterâ€ author.

â€œToday, they are trying to cancel a whole thousand-year-old country, our people. I am talking about the increasing discrimination of everything related to Russia, about this trend, which is unfolding in a number of Western states,â€ he added.

Zelensky left frustrated by unmet requests from NATO

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky virtually addressed leaders gathered in Brussels several times during the summits, repeatedly calling them out and asking them to do more to protect his country.

Zelensky told NATO leaders that Ukraine â€” which is not a NATO member â€” needs just a fraction of the allianceâ€™s combined firepower, saying, â€œYou can give us 1% of all your planes. One percent of all your tanks. One percent!â€

â€œYou have thousands of fighter jets, but we have not been given one yet,â€ he added.

Zelensky argued that NATO leaders should acknowledge what Ukraineâ€™s armed forces have demonstrated in the war against Russia, telling the group, â€œPlease, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards.â€

On another videoconference, Zelensky asked the G7 countries how many urgent summits would need to be held until the problems created by Russia could be solved, calling on the nations to issue a â€œfull embargo to tradeâ€ with Russia.

Zelensky separately thanked European Council members for putting sanctions on Russia but lamented that â€œit was a little late.â€

â€œYou blocked (the) Nord Stream 2 (pipeline). We are grateful to you. And rightly so. But it was also a little late, because if it had been in time, Russia would not have created a gas crisis. At least there was a chance,â€ he told the council.

Speaking to the council, Zelensky issued pointed remarks to Hungary, calling on the countryâ€™s prime minister, Viktor Orban, to â€œdecide alreadyâ€ on its treatment of Russia.

â€œYou hesitate whether to impose sanctions or not? And you hesitate whether to let weapons through or not? And you hesitate whether to trade with Russia or not? There is no time to hesitate. Itâ€™s time to decide already,â€ Zelensky said.

Possible Russian use of chemical weapons in Ukraine looms over summits

In Brussels, Biden met with global leaders on how the world would respond if Russia deploys a chemical, biological or nuclear weapon.

The use of such weapons would force NATO into a new posture, officials have acknowledged. But exactly how NATO would respond to the provocation remains unclear.

When asked on Thursday if the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine would trigger a military response from NATO, Biden said it would trigger a response â€œin kind.â€

The answer led Sullivan, Bidenâ€™s national security adviser, to clarify that the US response to a potential chemical weapons attack by Russia would be done in coordination with allies.

Sullivan would not say what the response would entai, but said that Russia would pay a â€œsevere priceâ€ and emphasized that â€œthe United States has no intention of using chemical weapons, period â€” under any circumstances.â€

The G7 issued a warning in its final joint statement against such an action. And NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg â€” whose tenure was extended a year amid the current crisis â€” said use of a chemical weapon would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict.

Bidenâ€™s meeting with refugees touches an emotional nerve

On the trip, Biden repeatedly sought to highlight the refugee crisis that has ensued as a result of the war, a crisis he saw firsthand when visiting Ukrainian refugees on Saturday.

One woman Biden spoke with told him she was there with her daughter, but her husband and son were back in Ukraine fighting. The woman, via a translator, spoke about the horror her family has endured and remarked of Putin: â€œWe Ukrainian mothers are ready to strangle him with our bare hands.â€

The President also met with chef JosÃ© AndrÃ©s and other volunteers in Warsaw at a food distribution site for AndrÃ©sâ€™ World Center Kitchen, the nonprofit devoted to providing meals in the wake of disasters. Biden met with some of the volunteers, some from Europe and some from the United States.

â€œGod love ya,â€ the President could be heard saying to them and asking if he could help them.

More than 3.5 million refugees have now fled Ukraine, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency released on Tuesday. Poland, a nation that has seen more than 2 million refugees from Ukraine enter its borders, has sought to get more US resources and flexibility in immigration policies to aid with the influx.

After meeting with the refugees, Biden was asked his opinion of Putin as he deals with the Russian leader every day. Biden responded, â€œHeâ€™s a butcher.â€

During the brief Q&A session with reporters, Biden recounted how he had been to similar places in his life but that he is always surprised by â€œthe depth and strength of the human spirit.â€

â€œItâ€™s incredible, itâ€™s incredible. See all those little children. Just want to hug, just want to say thanks. I mean, itâ€™s, just makes you so damn proud,â€ he said.

He added, â€œEach one of those children said something to the effect, â€˜Say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother whoâ€™s back there fighting.â€™ And I remember what itâ€™s like when you have someone in a war zone. Every morning you get up and you wonder. You just wonder. And you pray you donâ€™t get that phone call.â€

Upon his arrival in Poland on Friday, Biden met with humanitarian workers to discuss their efforts, saying he would have preferred to see the crisis from an even closer perspective but was prevented by security concerns.

â€œThey will not let me, understandably, I guess, cross the border and take a look at whatâ€™s going on in Ukraine,â€ he said. The White House has said it did not explore a visit to Ukraine.

Four years ago, Le Pen got 34% in the runoff. And the highest vote that her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the National Front, ever received was 18%. While Marine Le Pen lost Sunday, her positions continue to attract converts.

So terrified of Le Pen was the European establishment that before Sunday's election, the leaders of Spain, Portugal and Germany intervened in France's politics by imploring the French people to vote against her.

This runoff is ""for us, not an election like any other,"" wrote German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa and Spanish Premier Pedro Sanchez in Le Monde.

France faces a ""choice between a democratic candidate ... and a far-right candidate, who openly sides with those who attack our freedom and our democracy.""

More than 4 in 10 French voted for the candidate the EU leaders had described as anti-democratic.

In the first round of voting, Le Pen, along with rabid leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon and the hard right's Eric Zemmour, who ran third and fourth, behind Le Pen, together carried 52%.

Thus did three of the top four candidates for the presidency of France, and a majority of the French nation, show support for an idea that all three of them shared -- hostility to NATO.

In ruling France for the next five years, Macron, himself a critic of U.S. leadership and NATO, will have to keep this constituency in mind.

And Macron knows it. On his night of triumph, he conceded that many of those who voted for him were motivated not by an appreciation of what he had accomplished, but by a fear of Le Pen.

In the East of Europe, however, change may be on the horizon.

Major media -- Newsweek, the New York Post and Daily Mail -- are reporting rumors, based partly on recent videos of Russia's president, that Vladimir Putin may be suffering from cancer.

Also, news that Sweden and Finland may be joining NATO as the 31st and 32nd members of the alliance has caused a sharp reaction from Moscow, which is warning of a redeployment of nuclear weapons to the Baltic.

Again, have people thought through what it would mean to bring Finland, a nation the size of Germany with an 830-mile land border with Russia, into NATO?

With 4% of Russia's population, Finland would need NATO ground troops to man the border bases and crossing points into that country, and some of those troops would likely have to be Americans.

They would be staring across that chilly border directly at Russians, as in East and West Berlin in Cold War days.

Last Friday, in a press conference, Gen. Rustam Minnekayev said Russia seeks full control of all of southern Ukraine to give it ""another way out to Transnistria"" -- the breakaway state internationally recognized as part of Moldova.

Minnekayev charged Moldova with oppressing the Russian-speaking population of Transnistria, an echo of the claim the Kremlin used to justify the invasion of Ukraine.

Was this weekend's missile attack on Odessa an indicator of that Russian intent?

Putin's ally in Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, in his sixth term, having held the top office for three decades, is now 68, and his last election victory in 2020 was almost universally regarded as fraudulent.

Would Moscow, having lost Ukraine, sit still as Sweden and Finland moved onto the threshold of NATO and accept a neutrality for Belarus that would leave Russia without two of the three critical components of his Russian Federation as allies?

China's largest city, Shanghai, is today in a lockdown ordered by Xi Jinping, as China suddenly seems no longer the country that showed the world how to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic that began in Wuhan.

President Joe Biden may be making trips to New Hampshire, but few believe he will be running again in 2024, as the manifestations of his cognitive decline appear more frequent and disturbing.

Yet, one recalls.

Woodrow Wilson suffered an incapacitating stroke during a national tour to sell the peace treaty and League of Nations he had negotiated at Paris to the country and the Senate in 1919, yet survived his successor Warren Harding, who died in office in 1923.

As Macron was rolling up his election victory, Ron Klain, Biden's White House chief of staff, chortled at the outcome.

""An interesting observation, just FYI,"" tweeted Klain. ""President Macron appears to have secured a double-digit victory over LePen, at a time when his approval rating is 36%. Hmmm ... ""

If Macron can pull it off, why can't Biden, Klain is contending here.

855,A Dissenting View of US Policy toward Russia,"I oppose Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s decision to dismember Ukraine, and I support placing sanctions on Russia. But I am leery of the political process by which the United States and Russia reached this turn of the road, which could signal the beginning of a Cold War II. The process is sadly reminiscent of how the United States had previously come to a point in its foreign policy where it had no favorable options.

Since the Cold Warâ€™s end, American foreign policy has been conducted by responding to todayâ€™s news. To the extent the United States has had a long-term perspective, it is the hazy dream, first articulated in Christian millennial terms by the Puritans, of an American-led global transformation. (I wrote about this in a 1992 book, Grand Illusion, and political scientist John Mearsheimer recently described this outlook in The Great Delusion.) On the basis of this entirely unrealistic view of the world, the U.S. has stumbled into crises that it didnâ€™t know it was creating. Think of the circumstances â€” beginning after the first Gulf War that led to our invasion of Iraq. Or think of our conflict with Russia over Ukraine.

This conflict over Ukraine did not begin in December 2021 when the Russians began massing troops â€” in fact they had done so before, and pulled back â€” but at least thirty years before with the Clinton administrationâ€™s decision to prop up Russian President Boris Yeltsin and at the same time expand NATO eastward, eventually to Russiaâ€™s borders. On the plus side, Clinton recognized that Russia was not a natural adversary of the United States; on the minus side, Clinton fantasized that Russia (and China) could be brought into a U.S.-led and dominated capitalist world order. Yeltsin, it was imagined, would promote capitalist democracy at home and accede to NATO expansion and NATOâ€™s war against the Serbs, Russiaâ€™s fellow Slavs.

What happened was that Yeltsin, with the help from American money and advisors, wrecked the Russian economy and polity and paved the way for Vladimir Putin, whom Yeltsin appointed as his successor. At the same time, Americaâ€™s moves with NATO and the former Yugoslavia (where the United States made little effort to bring Russia in) began driving a wedge between the United States and Russia. As Masha Gessen has written in The New Yorker, the air war against Kosovo â€œforeshadowed the crisis in the Ukraine.â€

If you look at what happened over the next administrations, you see Russia making occasional efforts at cooperation â€” for instance, over al Qaeda and Afghanistan and then over Syria and Iran â€” and the United States making occasional efforts to â€œresetâ€ relations with the country. But the U.S. also took steps that were bound to deepen the conflict: Americaâ€™s attempt under George W. Bush to dominate the Middle East; Bushâ€™s proposal (backed by John McCain and Barack Obama and ignoring warnings from Putin) to bring Ukraine and Georgia into the NATO in 2008, which precipitated the war in Georgia; Obamaâ€™s deception of Russia (and China) at the United Nations over American intentions in Libya; and then, of course, American support for the Maidan revolution in Ukraine in 2014 that forced out elected pro-Russian leader and replaced him with an administration hostile to Russia and the Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. That in turn helped inspire Russiaâ€™s reclaiming Crimea.

Trump played up his friendship with and admiration for Putin, but his administration continued the Obama policies in Ukraine. These included arming Kyivâ€™s government against the Eastern separatists while the government, pressured by rightwing nationalists, rejected the terms of the 2015 Minsk II agreement reached by French, German, Ukrainian and Russian leaders. According to this agreement, the Kyiv government was to grant autonomy to the Russian-speaking Donbas region. (Trump also pulled out of the INF missile treaty with Russia that Ronald Reagan negotiated in 1987.)

In 2019, Ukrainians elected a President who revived Ukraineâ€™s hopes for NATO membership. In response, Putin and Russia have continually upped their ante, airing dreams of a greater Russia, on the one hand, and massing troops on the border, on the other. Now with Putinâ€™s recognition of the separatist regimes, he has, perhaps, set the stage for a wider conflict; and the United States and its allies in NATO would have no choice but to respond with sanctions. But sanctions, such as those imposed after Russia seized Crimea, are unlikely to deter Putin. And really draconian sanctions, such as those used against Iran, could plunge Europe and the U.S. into a recession.

The question to ask about this process is this: how did we get to the point where we were unable to respond constructively to Russian fears of a new encirclement from NATO? As my former colleague Robert Wright put it, how could American and Western European leaders say, on the one hand, that they did not contemplate Ukraine becoming a member of NATO and say, on the other hand, that they would not accede in any way to Putinâ€™s demand â€” at the center of his December communication with Biden â€” that NATO commit itself to barring Ukraineâ€™s membership? The same question could be asked about Putinâ€™s demand that Ukraineâ€™s government abide by Minsk II.

One could argue that Putin was always determined to re-incorpoate Ukraine into a greater Russia. Maybe, but it seems to me that Putinâ€™s pronouncements about Ukraineâ€™s sovereignty last summer and this week were part of his upping the ante against Americaâ€™s unwillingness to discuss his demands about NATO and the demands he made of Biden.

The conflict with Russia over Ukraine would seem to have called for what Richard Nixon called â€œplaying the long ball.â€ Nixon had played the long ball â€” defied prevailing opinion â€” by going to China. Earlier, French President Charles De Gaulle, one of Nixonâ€™s models, had done so by ending Franceâ€™s war in Algeria. Later, Ronald Reagan would do so with Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva. The United States might have stepped back from the years of provocations and resets to propose a â€œgrand bargainâ€ with Russia that would resolve or at least ease the conflict â€” one based, perhaps, on a neutral Ukraine or on the enforcement of the Minsk II agreement.

Perhaps the die was already cast. Perhaps, Putin was never amenable to negotiations. Or perhaps Biden and his foreign policy team of former staffers was not up to playing the long ball. Or perhaps there is still a possibility for a grand bargain. I donâ€™t know, because the exchanges among American, European, Ukrainian and Russian leaders remain secret. But it seems to me that without such a bargain, we could be headed for another foreign policy disaster â€” one that will have repercussions in the United States and Western Europe as well as in Russia and Ukraine. Think war, skyrocketing energy prices, recession, refugees and a Russian-Chinese alliance against the United States and its allies.",https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/a-dissenting-view-of-us-policy-toward-russia,Anti-Russian
2601,"As Biden Seeks More Foreign Oil, World Leaders Won't Take His Calls","In yet another embarrassment for President Joe Biden on the world stage, his attempts to secure more oil from foreign nations have been met with silence as Persian Gulf countries decline to throw Biden and his botched energy policy a lifeline amid record-high U.S. gas prices.

According to new reporting in The Wall Street Journal, Saudi and Emirati royals ""have signaled they wonâ€™t help ease surging oil prices."" So just how embarrassing is this for the supposed leader of the free world? Well, they apparently won't even pick up the phone to talk to Biden:

The White House unsuccessfully tried to arrange calls between President Biden and the de facto leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the U.S. was working to build international support for countering Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine and contain a surge in oil prices, said Middle East and U.S. officials. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the U.A.E.â€™s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan both declined U.S. requests to speak to Mr. Biden in recent weeks, the officials said, as Saudi and Emirati officials have become more vocal in recent weeks in their criticisms of American policy in the Gulf. â€œThere was some expectation of a phone call, but it didnâ€™t happen,â€œ said a U.S. official of the planned discussion between the Saudi Prince Mohammed and Mr. Biden. â€It was part of turning on the spigot [of Saudi oil].â€

Woof. So President Biden, the man that he and the White House have sought to portray as the leader organizing global opposition to Vladimir Putin and his forces' bloody invasion of Ukraine, can't even get people on the phone to talk about how he's going to sustain U.S. energy demands while punishing Putin by banning Russian oil imports to the U.S.

The Journal's report also notes that ""The Saudis have signaled that their relationship with Washington has deteriorated under the Biden administration,"" another foreign relationship that's circling the drain despite Biden's campaign pledge to renew relations with important leaders around the world (See also: France and the United Kingdom).

Both the Saudis and Emiratis ""are also concerned about the revival of the Iran nuclear deal, which doesnâ€™t address other security concerns of theirs and has entered the final stages of negotiations in recent weeks,"" another unsurprising reality that Biden â€” or his handlers â€” should have anticipated.

Due to Biden's souring relationship with these key oil-rich nations, both have decided they'd rather stick to their agreements with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) than even talk with President Biden about his proposal to get out of the energy pickle in which he's put the United States.

Making matters worse and even more embarrassing for Biden, it's not like the Saudis and Emiratis are sitting the whole Russia-Ukraine war thing out â€” as The Journal notes, ""Both Prince Mohammed and Sheikh Mohammed took phone calls from Russian President Vladimir Putin last week, after declining to speak with Mr. Biden,"" and ""They both later spoke with Ukraineâ€™s president.""

So Biden is the only one who's been iced out by the Saudis and Emiratis, potentially due in part to their ""energy alliance with Russia, one of the worldâ€™s top oil producers"" that ""has enhanced the power of OPEC while also bringing the Saudis and Emiratis closer to Moscow.""

That Saudi and Emirati leaders would decline Biden's calls is unsurprising given his previous attempt to secure more oil supplies from foreign producers was equally â€” and and also embarrassingly â€” unsuccessful.

As Townhall reported on August 17, 2021, Biden's request was rebuffed by OPEC which ""denied Biden's request for more oil, saying that its member countries 'and its allies, including Russia' â€” conveniently â€” think markets 'do not need more oil than they plan to release in the coming months, despite U.S. pressure to add supplies to check an oil price rise.'""

None of Biden's undignified begging and subsequent global embarrassment would be necessary had his administration built on the energy independence enjoyed during the Trump administration. But due to his own stubbornness or fear of angering the radical climate alarmists within his party, Biden is set to keep panhandling his way around the world looking for oil to make up for shortages his policies created.",https://townhall.com/tipsheet/spencerbrown/2022/03/09/as-biden-seeks-more-foreign-oil-world-leaders-wont-take-his-calls-n2604304,Pro-Russian
7746,Local Opinion: Ukraine and Republicans,"The following is the opinion and analysis of the writer:

At a concert at Catalina Foothills High School Saturday night, the audience spontaneously rose to its feet for the Ukrainian national anthem. It was not on the program but was added at the last moment to open the concert, in a statement of solidarity with the Ukrainian people as they battle Russian tanks and missiles with rifles.

It is a haunting and beautiful melody, and by its end some of the members of the audience and orchestra, none of whom spoke Ukrainian, were weeping. The orchestra then played Vivaldiâ€™s â€œFour Seasons,â€ an artistic triumph of Western civilization â€” the antithesis of the brutal Russian invasion of its peaceful neighbor at the behest of a gang of thugs and bullies in the Kremlin.

What a remarkable world in which concertgoers in Tucson, Arizona, care about foreign peoples half a world away â€” and rightly so. Shame on Putin and his cronies for betraying the Russian people. Shame on those countries around the world â€” India, which as a democracy ought to know better; China, whose hypocrisy knows no bounds; Brazil, whose leader appears simply unbalanced â€” who will not stand against this brutal and unwarranted aggression.

But most of all, here at home, shame on those who purport to be Republicans, yet cozy up to the new Stalin in Moscow, indeed even see him as a role model. How repugnant. This is not who Republicans are. Nor do I think that Putin is â€œsavvy.â€ I think he is a war criminal in a cheap suit.

I am a Republican from the tip of my fingers to the end of my toes. Mine is the party of Abraham Lincoln, who freed the slaves, and Teddy Roosevelt, who broke the trusts. My first vote was for Richard Nixon, who was my parentsâ€™ congressman. I worked for Ronald Reagan, who would spin in his grave at what some in our party are saying. I served in the Naval Reserve and at the Defense Department. My family knew John McCain and Mitt Romney. I have never voted for a Democrat in my life and I never will.

But I have no use â€” I have contempt â€” for those purporting to be Republicans who are serving as apologists for Putin and Russia, and who cozy up to evil. They should be ashamed for their abdication of Americaâ€™s values of freedom, liberty and democracy, and for their embrace of bullies around the world.

Americans â€” of any party â€” defend freedom. Americans â€” on both sides of the aisle â€” support democracy. Americans â€” Republicans and Democrats â€” stand up to bullies.

If you will not, if you do not share those values, if you want to abdicate our moral responsibility to fight the Putins of this world â€” get the heck out of my party.",https://tucson.com/opinion/local/local-opinion-ukraine-and-republicans/article_32c0b116-98af-11ec-8164-9f1c43b279b6.html,Anti-Russian
3843,Analysis: Why some African countries are thinking twice about calling out Putin,"By Stephanie Busari, CNN

Nelson Mandela was once asked why he still had relationships with, among others, Fidel Castro and Yasser Arafat, the Cuban and Palestinian leaders who had been branded terrorists by Western powers. The revered South African statesman replied that it was a mistake â€œto think that their enemies should be our enemies.â€

This stance has largely typified some African nationsâ€™ response to the Russia-Ukraine war. Across the continent, many appear hesitant to risk their own security, foreign investment and trade by backing one side in this conflict.

While there has been widespread condemnation of the attacks on Ukrainian civilians and their own citizens fleeing the warzone â€” from countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya â€” there has been a much more muted response from some key African nations.

Countries on the continent find themselves in a delicate position and will not want to get drawn into proxy battles, says Remi Adekoya, associate lecturer at Englandâ€™s University of York.

â€œThereâ€™s a strong strand of thought in African diplomacy that says African states should maintain the principle of non-interference and so they shouldnâ€™t get caught up in proxy wars between the East and the West. As some states did get caught up in proxy wars during the Cold War, for instance,â€ Adekoya told CNN.

One influential voice that has made it clear he will not make an enemy out of Russian leader Vladimir Putin is South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

While addressing his countryâ€™s parliament Thursday, he said: â€œOur position is very clear â€¦ there are those who are insisting that we should take a very adversarial stance and position against, say Russia. And the approach that we have chosen to take â€¦ is we are insisting that there should be dialogue.â€

After initially releasing a statement calling for Russia to immediately pull its forces out of Ukraine, South Africa has since laid the blame for the war directly at NATOâ€™s doorstep for considering Ukraineâ€™s membership into the military alliance, which Russia is against.

â€œThe war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less instability in the region.â€ Ramaphosa said in parliament Thursday.

Former South African President Jacob Zuma also earlier issued a statement saying Russia â€œfelt provoked.â€

â€œPutin has been very patient with the western forces. He has been crystal clear about his opposition of the eastern expansion of â€¦ NATO into Ukraine â€¦ and is on the record about the military threat posed to Russia by the presence of the forces â€¦ it looks justifiable that Russia felt provoked,â€ Zuma said in a statement issued by his foundation on March 6.

South Africa has strong ties to Russia and Ramaphosa has written about being approached to be a mediator in the conflict given its membership of BRICS â€” a group of emerging economies comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

The ties between the two countries also date back to apartheid times when the former Soviet Union supported South Africa and the African National Congress party in their liberation struggles. â€œThose favors have not been forgotten,â€ said Adekoya.

South Africa was one of 17 African nations to abstain on the UN resolution demanding that Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine on March 2. It took a similar stance during Putinâ€™s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Nigeria and Egypt were among the 28 African nations that voted to condemn Russia, while eight others didnâ€™t submit a vote. Eritrea was the only African country that outrightly voted against the resolution.

Zimbabweâ€™s foreign ministry said in a statement it was unconvinced that the UN resolution was driven towards dialogue, rather â€œit poured more fuel to the fire, thus complicating the situation.â€

â€˜Strongman leadershipâ€™

Many of the countries that abstained from the UN vote are authoritarian regimes. They see Putinâ€™s unilateral decision to invade Ukraine as a show of power and ego that they can appreciate and align with, Yetunde Odugbesan-Omede, a political analyst and professor at New Yorkâ€™s Farmingdale State College, told CNN.

One of those who have spoken out prominently in support of the Russian leader is Lt. Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba, the influential son of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.

His father has ruled Uganda with an iron fist for 36 years and there has been speculation that Kainerugaba is a would-be successor when the 78-year-old Museveni eventually stands down.

Kainerugaba tweeted that: â€œThe majority of mankind (that are non-white) support Russiaâ€™s stand in Ukraine. Putin is absolutely right!â€

Some African countries have also hesitated in speaking out against Russia because they want to â€œkeep their options open if they face existential threats or some kind of revolution in their own country in the future,â€ said Adekoya.

â€œThey saw Putin keep Assad in power in Syria because if not for Russiaâ€™s intervention, Assadâ€™s regime would have fallen long ago,â€ he added.

Adekoya also pointed out that some of the muted response stems from what is perceived as Western hypocrisy.

Kenyaâ€™s UN Security Council representative Martin Kimani gave a powerful speech on the brink of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine.

Kimani drew a parallel between Ukraineâ€™s emergence as an independent state after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the experience of post-colonial states in Africa, criticizing Russian PresidentVladimir Putinâ€™s buildup of forces and his support for redrawing Ukraineâ€™s borders by recognizing the breakaway statelets of Donetsk and Luhansk.

â€œKenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force,â€ he said, referring to Russiaâ€™s recognition of the two territories as independent states. â€œWe must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression.â€

During the speech, he also mentioned other nations on the Security Council who had breached international law and faced no sanctions. â€He didnâ€™t mention them by name, but he was talking about the US and UK who invaded Iraq in 2003 â€¦ and were never really held to account,â€ Adekoya said.

â€œThere are many people in many parts of the world who would like to see other regions gaining strength and would like to see the end of Western domination of the world order, putting it simply â€¦ of course, no right-thinking person in Africa or anywhere in the world looks at what is going on in Ukraine now and thinks that itâ€™s a good thing â€¦ but many people do see the hypocrisy,â€ he added.

Establishing stronger ties

In recent years, Russia has established itself as one of Africaâ€™s most valuable trading partners â€” becoming a major supplier of military hardware with key alliances in Nigeria, Libya, Ethiopia and Mali.

Africa accounted for 18% of Russian arms exports between 2016 and 2020, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) think tank.

Some analysts say the support or non-censure of Russia speaks to a wider sentiment in parts of Africa that Western policy positions do not always work in their favor.

â€œThe message that Moscow is pushing is that if you are tired of the paternalistic way the West approaches you, we are going to be your security partners. It will be a relationship of equals,â€ Aanu Adeoye, a Russia-Africa analyst at Chatham House, told CNN.

Unlike many of its European counterparts, Russia is not a former colonial power in Africa and so has a wider scope of opportunity in making soft power moves that aim to challenge Western dominance on the continent.

The Soviet Union also had client relationships with many African states during the Cold War, and Moscow has looked to revive some of those ties.

Before the invasion, Russian state media outlet RT announced plans to set up a new hub in Kenya with a job ad that said it wanted to â€œcover stories that have been overlooked by other organizationsâ€ and that â€œchallenge conventional wisdom about Africa.

Yet Africa has often been at the heart of the tussle for influence in the great power competitions between key geopolitical players such as the US, China and Russia.

Some countries are trying to leverage this position in a variety of ways.

Odugbesan-Omede explained that Tanzania, for example, has identified the current situation as a chance for its energy industry to profit. â€œTanzaniaâ€™s President, Samia Suluhu Hassan, sees this an opportunity to look for markets to export gas,â€ she said. â€Tanzania has the sixth largest gas reserve in Africa. While some African countries will sustain some economic shock from the Russian-Ukraine fight, others are trying to weather the storm by looking for new avenues of profitability,â€ Odugbesan-Omede added.

4190,Top GOP Intel lawmaker says Bidenâ€™s Putin comment complicates ending Ukraine conflict,"The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee said Presidentâ€™s Biden comments over the weekend, in which he said Russian President Vladimir Putin â€œcannot remain in power,â€ will put a further strain on U.S.-Russia relations.

Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) said Bidenâ€™s declaration â€œmakes it more complex to end the conflict in Ukraine.â€

â€œHow does he, in the future, sit with Vladimir Putin?â€ Turner added.

Biden on Monday left the door open to meeting with Putin but said it would depend on what the Russian president wanted to talk about.

Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine entered its second month amid Bidenâ€™s visit to Brussels and Warsaw late last week in which he declared in a speech on Saturday that Putin â€œcannot remain in power,â€ which sparked mass confusion about whether the president had just changed official U.S. policy to favoring regime change in Russia.

After the White House attempted to quickly walk back his comments on Saturday, saying what Biden meant was that Putin should not exercise power outside of Russia, the president on Monday said his words reflected a personal â€œmoral outrageâ€ and not a stated policy change.

Turner said Bidenâ€™s pivotal speech in Warsaw should have served as a critical assertion against Russian aggression. Instead, Turner said, Bidenâ€™s remarks shifted the focus away from countering Russiaâ€™s attacks on Ukraine and onto confusion about regime change.

â€œThatâ€™s not President Bidenâ€™s decision, and itâ€™s not ours either,â€ Turner said before adding that he believed Biden was mishandling the U.S. response.

The White House has warned for weeks that Russia has the potential to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.

The Wall Street journal reported that Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and two Ukrainian peace negotiators developed symptoms consistent with suspected poisoning following a meeting earlier this month in Kyiv.

Asked about this during a Washington Post event, Turner said that poisoning, murders and attacks on civilians should be expected from Putin as he escalates Russian aggression beyond the Kremlinâ€™s borders.

â€œTheyâ€™ve become more aggressive in space, more aggressive with their neighbors, and then ultimately on the heels of invading and annexing Crimea, on the heels of having invaded Georgia, now in a full-scale war with Ukraine,â€ Turner said.",https://thehill.com/homenews/house/600082-top-gop-intel-lawmaker-says-bidens-putin-comment-complicates-ending-ukraine,Neutral
1845,This isnâ€™t the first time Virginia ABC has pulled liquor from its shelves for a political statement,"Russian vodka brands pulled from state-owned liquor store shelves in solidarity with Ukraine will be kept in storage for now â€” a move with precedent in the liquor monopolyâ€™s nearly 100-year history.

The seven Russian-sourced vodkas in Virginia ABC inventory â€” amounting $77,500 in stock â€” will be kept in store back rooms and other state facilities â€œfor the time being,â€ ABC spokesperson Carol Mawyer said in an email. Another $30,000 in stock, still owned by suppliers and not purchased by the ABC, will also be held back from shelves.

The Russian vodka brands to be removed include Beluga, Hammer & Sickle, Imperia, Mamont, Organika, Russian Standard and ZYR.

The Russian-sourced spirits accounted for $1.2 million in Virginia ABC sales during fiscal year 2021 â€” a fraction of the $57.9 million generated in the same time frame by Titoâ€™s brand vodka, the top-grossing vodka in the state.

Itâ€™s unclear what will ultimately happen to the liquor. The products wonâ€™t be destroyed, Mawyer said.

The state-run liquor store system attributed the decision to Gov. Glenn Youngkinâ€™s call on Saturday for the state to take â€œdecisive actionâ€ in support of Ukraine. .

It isnâ€™t the first time the Virginia ABC has pulled alcohol from its shelves based on political sentiment.

Stolichnaya, or â€œStoli,â€ was pulled from Virginia ABC shelves at least two times in the 1980s amid the Cold War. It was the only Russian-imported product carried in state liquor stores at the time, The Virginian-Pilot reported in 1983. The vodka was quietly returned to ABC shelves once tensions thawed.

This time around, Stolichnaya is one of the â€œRussian-themedâ€ vodkas staying on the shelf, as it is made in Latvia, according to its website.

Still, the vodka with hard-to-pin-down origins in Moscow was an instinctual target of wrath during chills in U.S.-Russian relations in the 1980s.

The first removal in 1980 was prompted by the then-Soviet Unionâ€™s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The Virginia ABC halted orders of Stolichnaya but kept remaining inventory up for sale until stock ran out, the Associated Press reported. The product returned in April 1981, The Pilot reported.",https://richmond.com/entertainment/dining/this-isn-t-the-first-time-virginia-abc-has-pulled-liquor-from-its-shelves-for/article_b7d84f9f-34c1-548e-9753-ab90e9a0c6ce.html,Anti-Russian
446,US Embassy in Kyiv closing amid threat of Russian invasion,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Monday that the U.S. is shuttering its embassy in Kyiv ahead of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine that officials are warning could happen any day.

â€œWe are in the process of temporarily relocating our Embassy operations in Ukraine from our Embassy in Kyiv to Lviv due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,â€ Blinken said in a statement, stressing that the Biden administration remains engaged with the Ukrainian government and is continuing â€œintensive diplomatic efforts to deescalate the crisis.â€

â€œThese prudent precautions in no way undermine our support for or our commitment to Ukraine. Our commitment to Ukraineâ€™s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering,â€ Blinken continued.

â€œWe also continue our sincere efforts to reach a diplomatic solution, and we remain engaged with the Russian government following President Bidenâ€™s call with President Putin and my discussion with Foreign Minister Lavrov,â€ he added. â€œThe path for diplomacy remains available if Russia chooses to engage in good faith. We look forward to returning our staff to the Embassy as soon as conditions permit.â€

Blinken also urged American citizens in Ukraine to register with the State Department to stay aware of any new developments on the security situation.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Monday said that the embassy compound is being guarded by the Ukrainian National Guard Police and that it is the intention of the U.S. to return to the embassy â€œas soon as it is safe for us to do so.â€

The State Department on Saturday announced it was drawing down its staff in Kyiv and ending consular services for Americans, transferring those operations to the U.S. mission in the Ukrainian city of Lyiv, which sits closer to the border with Poland.

The Biden administration last week urged Americans still in Ukraine to leave the country within 48 to 72 hours, raising alarm that Russia could launch an attack or invade Ukraine at any time.

The State Department on Sunday further sent out a notification on Twitter that U.S. citizens can enter Poland through the land border with Ukraine, noting that no advance approval is needed in addition to a valid U.S. passport and proof of COVID-19 vaccination.

The State Department has not indicated it is aware of the total number of how many Americans and lawful permanent residents are in Ukraine, as these groups are not required to register with the U.S. government when abroad.

But U.S. officials have consistently encouraged Americans to avail themselves of commercial options to leave Ukraine ahead of any potential outbreak of conflict, saying that the government would not support a mass evacuation like the one that occurred in Afghanistan.

Alarm over an imminent Russian invasion against Ukraine comes as the U.S. and its western partners continue to push the Kremlin to take seriously their efforts at diplomacy to address what Moscow says are its security concerns over Ukraineâ€™s closer ties with the West and expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday reportedly urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to continue diplomatic talks.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, is in Ukraine on Monday and is heading to Moscow on Tuesday in one of the last scheduled diplomatic Russian meetings with a Western leader.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also posted on Facebook that the country would celebrate a national day of unity on Wednesday, referencing reports that Russia could possibly launch an invasion on that day.

3772,"After heavy losses and few gains, Russia may be moderating its ambitions in Ukraine","Senior U.S. officials are coming to believe that Russia has moderated its war goals in Ukraine after stiff resistance inflicted heavy losses and shattered any hope of a swift and easy victory, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

Per the Journal, international observers believed Russian President Vladimir Putin's initial objective was to capture Kyiv within days, depose Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and install a pro-Russian puppet regime.

Now, Biden administration officials told the Journal, Putin's goals appear to be less ambitious. If Putin can bully Ukraine into accepting neutrality, recognizing Russian claims on Crimea and the Donbas, and surrendering a ""land bridge"" connecting the two, he'll be able to spin that as a win back home.

Securing this land bridge would require capturing the port city of Mariupol. Russian forces encircled the city weeks ago and have been pushing into its neighborhoods in recent days. On Sunday, Russia demanded that the city surrender, but Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk replied early Monday that ""[t]here can be no question of surrender,"" Reuters reports.

Putin may well be looking for an off-ramp from this war. An assessment released Saturday by the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C., concluded that Ukraine has ""defeated the initial Russian campaign"" and that Russian forces must take a ""lengthy operational pause"" to regroup if they are to have any chance of capturing major Ukrainian cities.

In an address to the nation on Sunday, Zelensky said Ukrainian forces have killed over 14,000 Russian troops since the invasion began less than four weeks ago. The U.S., which estimates Russian military deaths at around 7,000, lost just over 4,500 troops during the nine-year Iraq War.

None of this is certain, however. The Institute for the Study of War released another assessment on Sunday reporting that Russia appears to be ""preparing its population"" for a protracted conflict by ""implementing increasingly draconian mobilization measures.""",https://theweek.com/russo-ukrainian-war/1011551/after-heavy-losses-and-few-gains-russia-may-be-moderating-its-ambitions,Neutral
8335,"Denmark opens its arms to Ukrainians, while trying to send Syrian refugees home","By Tara John, CNN

When Denmark became the first liberal democracy to tell Syrian refugees to return to their war-torn home in 2019, Russian jets were still dropping missiles in Syria, in an effort to help President Bashar al-Assadâ€™s regime regain control of the country.

Ukraine is now being pummelled by the same Russian military, forcing more than 2.2 million people to flee to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.

But instead of being met by xenophobia, detention centers and threats of repatriation in the European Union, Ukrainian refugees are being welcomed by European nations like Denmark with open arms.

â€œWhen there is war in Europe and a European neighbor is exposed to what we see in Ukraine, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind: We must help as best we can â€¦ by welcoming Ukrainians on Danish soil,â€ said Mattias Tesfaye, the Danish minister for foreign affairs and integration, soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.

The Danish government is drafting legislation that will suspend asylum rules for Ukrainians, Rasmus Stoklund, the foreign affairs spokesperson for Denmarkâ€™s ruling Social Democratic Party, told CNN.

â€œThey wonâ€™t be part of the asylum system,â€ Stocklund told CNN. Instead the proposed law will make it easier for Ukrainians to receive residency permits â€œso they can quickly start in school, on an education or in a job,â€ according to a statement by the Danish immigration and integration ministry.

This would be in line with the European Union granting temporary protection for Ukrainians, allowing them to enter the bloc without a visa and to choose which country to go to.

Those eligible would be given protected status â€” similar to that of a refugee â€” in any EU country for a one-year period, which may be reviewed in future. This is a stark contrast with the EUâ€™s asylum rules where refugees must ask for asylum in the first member state they entered. Efforts by the EU to reform this system and help to equitably resettle asylum-seekers around the bloc have been unsuccessful.

But critics are accusing the Danish government of hypocrisy, since it is currently urging Syrian refugees originating from Damascus and its surrounding countryside to return there, despite the ongoing civil war and the regimeâ€™s brutal reputation.

While fighting has subsided considerably in the region around Damascus, activists say the Danish government is actively putting Syrians in harmâ€™s way.

In a statement to CNN, the Danish Ministry of Immigration and Integration Affairs said all refugees were treated the same. â€œRegardless of the law on temporary residence permits for persons expelled from Ukraine, all persons applying for asylum in Denmark have the same rights in the Danish asylum system.â€

It added that about 30,000 Syrians who have been granted a residence permit in Denmark since 2014 still live in the country.

But Michala Clante Bendixen, the head of Refugees Welcome Denmark, which advocates for a streamlined asylum system, said the disparity in treatment suggests the government places a higher value on White lives.

Bendixen said the 2015 migrant crisis had shown that: â€œIf people arrive from Afghanistan or Syria, they will be met with suspicion, they will be called migrants until they [gain] refugee [status]. But now we immediately call Ukrainians refugees. Whatâ€™s the difference?

â€œItâ€™s so disappointing and so terrible that people are so limited in their empathy with other human beings in the world,â€ she added.

Punitive policies

Syrian-born siblings Dania and Hussam, who integrated fully into Danish society after arriving in the country as refugees in 2015, have been caught in Denmarkâ€™s anti-immigrant dragnet, say campaigners.

The pair, now in their 20s and fluent Danish speakers, have spent the past year in limbo, after Danish authorities decided not to extend their fatherâ€™s residency permit, which their own visas are linked to. They are appealing the decision.

Last year, the siblings told CNN they feared that if they had to return to Syria, they could be punished for â€œturning our backsâ€ on the regime. Hussam also risks being conscripted into the Syrian army, he said.

An estimated 600 of the more than 35,000 Syrian refugees who traveled to Denmark have been stripped of their residency status by immigration authorities, Bendixen says.

While the Danish government cannot repatriate Syrians as it does not have diplomatic relations with Syria, it aims to compel them to leave by making Denmark as inhospitable a place as possible to live in, and covering their travel costs to return, say asylum experts.

In 2021, Tesfaye, the Danish minister for immigration and integration, defended the policy in a statement to CNN, saying that â€œDenmark has been open and honest from day oneâ€ that residence permits for Syrian refugees are â€œtemporary, and that the permit can be revoked if the need for protection ceases to exist.

â€œThe approach of the Danish government is to provide protection to those in need of it, but when the conditions in their home country have improved, former refugees should return to the home country and reestablish their life there,â€ Tesfaye added.

Those who have exhausted all legal avenues to appeal their lost residency status face being sent to deportation facilities, which Bendixen describes as open-air prisons designed to break people down.

The centers are partially open, which means that occupants are able to move in and out freely, but they have to check in every evening, have no income, and no right to work or study. One such center is around four miles from the nearest bus stop, making practically impossible for anyone to leave.

The move is just one of a number of policies by Danish authorities that appear to target the countryâ€™s non-White immigrant community, critics say.

In 2019, the government began to control where immigrants lived by forcing social and ethnic change in 15 low-income housing estates across the country. Authorities described them as â€œhard ghettos,â€ and are defined by Danish regulations partly according to the races of residents.

And as Syrians braved treacherous journeys to reach the safety of Europe, a so-called jewelry bill was rolled out in 2016, allowing the government to take certain assets from asylum-seekers to contribute to the countryâ€™s welfare state.

â€œWe might as well be honest about the fact that we would rather help Ukrainian refugees than Somalians and Palestinians,â€ The former Liberal Party immigration minister Inger Stojberg, whose party pushed through the so-called jewelry bill, wrote on Facebook on Wednesday. â€œNo one dares to say it like it is: Itâ€™s because the Ukrainians are more like us and because they are primarily Christians.â€

Stoklund, foreign affairs spokesperson for the ruling Social Democratic Party, told CNN the jewelry law will not apply to Ukrainians as they will not be part of the asylum system if the draft legislation is approved.

That opt-out is â€œunfair,â€ according to Bendixen, especially considering the financial burden other non-European refugees face in trying to reach safety. â€œUkrainians can just travel as tourists into Europe,â€ since they have enjoyed visa-free status in the EU since 2017.

â€œThey donâ€™t need human smugglers,â€ she explained. â€œThey donâ€™t need to risk their lives on small sinking boats or in the desert to travel safely to Europe â€¦ they will not have to go through the asylum system â€” which is very slow and can easily take a year before you get your case decided.â€

Despite this, descriptions of Ukrainian refugees from politicians and in the media could not be more different to the chaotic response to the 2015 migrant crisis driven largely by the Syrian civil war.

â€œPart of the answer has to do with identity,â€ wrote migration and asylum expert Lamis Abdelaaty on Twitter. â€œUkrainians are seen as White, Christian. Syrians, Afghans, and others are not perceived this way. People sympathize with refugees who they think share their race, religion, etc.â€

â€œBut identity is not the whole story,â€ said Abdelaaty, an assistant professor at Syracuse University in the US state of New York. â€œThere is a foreign policy dimension to this too. It matters that Ukrainians are fleeing a Russian invasion. Welcoming them is another way for European countries to condemn Putin and to powerfully signal which side of the conflict they are on.â€

The 2015 migrant crisis saw an estimated 1 million asylum-seekers enter Europe. They were greeted by a skeptical press, a rise in anti-migrant policymaking â€” as seen in Denmark â€” and a rise in support for far-right parties, following a series of ISIS terrorist attacks over the following year.

â€œAnd, now, suddenly, even more people are arriving in two weeks and everybodyâ€™s like: â€˜Oh, yeah, we can handle it and we have lots of space and they should be welcome,'â€ Bendixen said.

As Russian airstrikes become more indiscriminate, the United Nations said Tuesday that the outflow of Ukrainian refugees hit 2 million as mainly women, children, and the elderly seek refuge from the unprovoked aggression. Those numbers are expected to swell as attacks intensify on a number of key cities and towns.

The response to Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine shows that countries like Denmark can take in refugees with compassion. The color of a refugeeâ€™s skin, or their religion, should not have any bearing on that response, activists say.

4808,"Putin spokesman's surprising admission: We've taken significant losses, it's a huge tragedy","I didnâ€™t expect this.

But I suppose some realities are so plain that even Russia wonâ€™t bother to dispute them. As the photos of burned-out tanks and dead Russian troops pile up on social media, claiming that losses are minimal would make the Kremlin seem ridiculous while failing to convince anyone.

The most Dmitri Peskov can do here to spin the state of the war is to say that the countryâ€™s troops withdrew from northern parts of Ukraine like Kiev and Chernihiv as a goodwill gesture towards negotiation, not because the Ukrainians were about to run them off. The truth is that if Russia had left those troops in place and they had been routed, the army might have been too undermanned to mount an effective offensive in the Donbas, raising the specter of total defeat. Putin and his advisors likely came to the difficult conclusion that the only way theyâ€™d stand a chance of a face-saving win in the east was accepting a difficult defeat in the north and evacuating those troops to fight another day.

""We have significant losses of troops"". Vladimir Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov says it's a ""huge tragedy to us"" to have lost Russian troops during the war in Ukraine.https://t.co/X3flQUBL0r ðŸ“º Sky 501, Virgin 602, Freeview 233 and YouTube pic.twitter.com/PGHoFvdewb â€” Sky News (@SkyNews) April 7, 2022

Another reason Peskov may be willing to concede major losses is because Russian citizens are getting glimpses of the truth:

The brother, Aleksandr Kononov, last saw him at the military hospital morgue in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don in March. Lieutenant Kononov had died in a firefight for a steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. He was 34. Walking to the morgue, Mr. Kononov recalled, he passed the open gate of a warehouse and glimpsed dozens of black body bags lined up on the floorâ€¦ Six weeks after President Vladimir V. Putinâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, many Russians remain in the dark about the depth of their countryâ€™s losses â€” and about the carnage and brutal atrocities that their military is inflicting as it retreats in the North. But increasingly, the reality of war is intruding in the lives of regular families when death notices and black body bags arrive, causing some, like Mr. Kononov, to question the warâ€¦ With war deaths growing, word of the dangers of fighting in Ukraine is filtering down through the public, and there have even been cases of service members trying to avoid combat.

One lawyer in southern Russia says heâ€™s received more than 100 inquiries from Russian troops and national guardsmen about their legal rights to refuse to deploy to Ukraine if ordered. But not everyone whoâ€™s lost a loved one to the war blames Moscow. One man whose son died recently in combat blamed the â€œUkrainian Nazisâ€ and their American patrons: â€œMy personal opinion is we should just whack America with a nuclear bomb and thatâ€™s it, so that they stop getting involved in other countriesâ€™ business.â€

Whacking America with a nuclear bomb wouldnâ€™t stop us from getting involved in Russiaâ€™s business â€” rather the opposite â€” but we shouldnâ€™t expect a grieving father to think clearly.

Speaking of grief and revenge, the Ukrainians have been hard at work lately trying to figure out which Russian units specifically were responsible for the horrors in Bucha. Theyâ€™d identified some culprits:

On April 3, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, published a list of Russian units, both military and National Guard, that he said had been deployed to Bucha and two other towns in the Kyiv region, Irpin and Hostomel. Among those he named were the 104th and 234th Airborne Assault Regiments of the 76th Airborne Assault Division. Based in the northwestern Russian city of Pskov, the division is renowned in Soviet and Russian military history, for both battlefield prowess and brutality. During the Second Chechen War in the early 2000s, paratroopers from the 76th Airborne Division were credibly accused of killing Chechen civilians indiscriminately.

Other circumstantial evidence found in the town like a discarded ammo box also points to the 76th Airborne. Reportedly a Russian soldierâ€™s cell phone was also recovered and his social media accounts examined; photos on his Instagram account show him pictured with members of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade. After hearing that, the Ukrainian government published two lists, one identifying the officers in that brigade and the other supposedly identifying every last soldier in it. A separate hacked list identifying more than 120,000 Russian soldiers by name, date of birth, passport number, and unit was published weeks earlier.

I canâ€™t tell if these are meant to be hit lists or target lists for cancellation campaigns, so that Russiaâ€™s participants in the war can be named and shamed long after itâ€™s over. The war will eventually end but the hostility will not.

By the way, British intelligence is telling reporters that the Ukrainians are increasingly confident that Russiaâ€™s army is exhausted and can be broken *if* Kiev gets the weapons it needs, starting with tanks. â€œMy agenda is very simple. It has only three items on it. Its weapons, weapons, and weapons,â€ said Ukraineâ€™s foreign minister. Yesterday the Czech Republic became the first country to agree to send tanks to Ukraine. The Brits seem very likely to follow.",https://hotair.com/allahpundit/2022/04/07/putin-spokesmans-surprising-admission-weve-taken-significant-losses-its-a-huge-tragedy-n460807,Anti-Russian
3358,UN Security Council meeting again Thursday to debate Ukraine,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) â€” The U.N. Security Council will meet Thursday at the request of six Western nations that sought an open session on Ukraine ahead of an expected vote on a Russian humanitarian resolution that they have sharply criticized for making no mention of Moscowâ€™s war against its smaller neighbor.

â€œRussia is committing war crimes and targeting civilians. Russiaâ€™s illegal war on Ukraine is a threat to us all,â€ tweeted the U.N. mission of the United Kingdom, one of the six countries that requested the meeting.

The mission posted the flags of the six council nations requesting the meeting â€” the UK, U.S., France, Ireland, Norway and Albania.

Russia circulated a proposed Security Council resolution Tuesday that would demand protection for civilians â€œin vulnerable situationsâ€ in Ukraine and safe passage for humanitarian aid and people seeking to leave the country but without mentioning the war.

The draft resolution would also underscore the need for â€œthe parties concernedâ€ to agree on humanitarian pauses to rapidly evacuate â€œall civilians,â€ but it never identifies the parties.

The resolution is expected to be voted on by the council Friday.

Russia presented its draft a day after France and Mexico announced that a humanitarian resolution on Ukraine that they co-sponsored was being moved to the 193-member General Assembly, after two weeks of discussions on the draft in the 15-member Security Council,.

The France-Mexico draft resolution would demand â€œan immediate cessation of hostilitiesâ€ and deplore â€œthe dire humanitarian consequences of the hostilities against Ukraine.â€ Those provisions are not in the Russian text, and the France-Mexico resolution would almost certainly have led to a Russian veto if put to a vote in the council.

Britainâ€™s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, tweeted Tuesday that the Russian draft â€œhas a few glaring omissions. For example, the fact that Russia is the aggressor here, and it is Russiaâ€™s invasion driving this humanitarian crisis.â€

Deputy Russian ambassador Dmitry Polyansky responded in a tweet Thursday saying, â€œGood ruse!â€ and asking the UK to provide examples where U.N. humanitarian resolutions cited â€œaggressionsâ€ or â€œinvasions.â€

Russian authorities maintain they did not start the war and have repeatedly decried reports of Russian military setbacks or civilian deaths in Ukraine as fake news. They also denounce reports calling its military operations a war or an invasion. State media outlets and government officials insist Russian forces target only military facilities despite widespread video footage of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and hospitals, being hit by Russian missiles.

Polyansky tweeted that Russia â€œis fully on board with a humanitarian textâ€ but said it was clear Western council members donâ€™t need one.

Mexican Ambassador Juan Ramon De La Fuente, however, told reporters Wednesday that he and French Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere were working on taking their humanitarian resolution to the General Assembly â€œvery soon â€” in the following days.â€ He expressed hope the assembly can vote on it this week or next week.

The Russian Mission had said a vote on their resolution could take place as early as Wednesday, but some council members wanted to discuss the text and there was a closed meeting of council experts Wednesday morning. Russia then asked to delay the vote, and the United Arab Emirates, which holds the council presidency this month, said it is now scheduled for Friday.

Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said Tuesday it was â€œunconscionable that Russia, the aggressor responsible for creating this crisis, would have the audacity to put forward this resolution.â€

She said the United States will work with other countries for a General Assembly resolution â€œthat will more accurately reflect the views of U.N. member statesâ€ about the impact of Russiaâ€™s â€œunprovoked aggression.â€

After Russia vetoed a Western-backed Security Council resolution demanding that it stop the war and withdraw its forces from Ukraine, the sponsors introduced a similar resolution in the General Assembly. It was adopted March 2 by an overwhelming vote of 141-5, with 35 countries abstaining.

Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but there are no vetoes and they do have clout in reflecting international opinion.

Norwegian Ambassador Mona Juul told reporters Wednesday that â€œif really Russia wanted to stop the suffering of the civilians in Ukraine, they should stop the war.â€

In the event of tensions between Washington and Moscow over Ukraine boiling over, oil prices could rise up to $100 per barrel, given that both Russia and the United States are among the biggest world producers of oil, oil historian Daniel Yergin told Bloomberg.According to Yergin, further escalation could trigger â€œa panicky reaction in the market.""Yergin is not the only one giving grim predictions for oil prices if the Ukraine situation gets worse. RBC Head of Global Commodities Strategy Helima Croft said, cited by CNBC, that the markets could be impacted even by a high risk of Russian ""invasion,"" given ""the stakes involved.""Concerns in the West continue even though Russia has repeatedly underlined that it does not pose any threat to Ukraine. Moscow has also dismissed the ""invasion"" claims, pointing instead at the fact that NATO and the US have amassed troops and weapons in Eastern Europe. The Kremlin explained that this has triggered concerns in Moscow â€“ as a result, it rolled out some security proposals to the Western countries, particularly demanding legal guarantees from NATO that it will not expand eastwards and deploy offensive weapons in Eastern Europe.US Assistant Treasury Secretary for Economic Policy Benjamin Harris earlier voiced concerns in regard to how geopolitics could affect the global efforts to stabilise energy prices, already shaken by the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.The situation over Ukraine has hit oil markets over the past six weeks, with global oil prices increasing by 14 percent in January for the largest monthly gain since last February. Aside from this, oil prices have been on the rise in late 2020 due to the coronavirus, prompting a separate drama in OPEC+ group, with its members having hard time about deciding on output cuts.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is on the brink of reaching an agreement to roll out new â€œpreventativeâ€ sanctions against Russia, Senator Jeanne Shaheen has announced.â€œAs we look at whatâ€™s happening right now in Ukraine, this is the potential for the biggest conflict since World War II, and if we donâ€™t take a stand against [Vladimir] Putin now and hold him accountable, itâ€™s not at all clear what country is going to be next,â€ Shaheen said, speaking at a virtual forum held by the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington-based think tank on Wednesday.On top of that, Shaheen warned that Washington was also â€œlooking atâ€ â€œmassive sanctions on Putin and Russia so that should he invade Ukraine, he would feel and the country would feel very directly, the impact of those sanctions.â€No 'Invasion' to Fear, Ukraine SaysSenior Ukrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelensky, the countryâ€™s defence minister, and the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council have recently broken with their Western patrons regarding the â€œRussian invasionâ€ danger, either privately or publicly dismissing US and European chatter about â€œRussian invasionâ€ plans, and criticizing foreign media for whipping up tensions.Stoking TensionsMoscow has repeatedly denied that it has any plans to invade its neighbour, and accused Western powers of stoking tensions as an excuse to beef up NATOâ€™s military presence near Russiaâ€™s borders. On Wednesday, the Pentagon announced that President Biden has approved redeploying 1,000 US troops from Germany to Romania, with 2,000 more to be shipped out to Poland and Germany from the US in the coming days. On top of that, the US will continue to maintain and possibly beef up the 8,500 troop-strong â€˜heightened alertâ€™ force stationed in the US and ready to ship out to Europe at a momentâ€™s notice.Also on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the administration would no longer use the word â€œimminentâ€ to describe the possibility of a Russian â€œinvasionâ€ of Ukraine because it â€œstill [doesnâ€™t] knowâ€ whether President Putin has â€œmade a decisionâ€ to attack the country.Putin blasted the US and its NATO allies on Tuesday, saying that the Western bloc had failed to take Russian concerns about NATOâ€™s expansion and the deployment of missile systems near Russian borders into account.The Russian Foreign Ministry published a pair of security proposals aimed at significantly easing tensions between Moscow and the West â€“ including by limiting troop, missile, aircraft and warship deployments near one anotherâ€™s borders. The proposals asked the US and NATO to commit to halt the Western blocâ€™s expansion into any more former Soviet republics, including Ukraine and Georgia, and limit troop deployments to countries that joined the alliance after the end of the Cold War. US and NATO officials formally rejected the Russian proposals last week, saying the allianceâ€™s â€˜open doorâ€™ policy will not be scrapped. Moscow has warned that it will be forced to create a system of â€œcounter-threatsâ€ if its security proposals were rejected but has yet to reveal what these may look like.

Russia is â€œnot surprised by the new â€˜creativeâ€™ scenarioâ€ outlined by the Pentagon and the US State Department regarding Russiaâ€™s alleged plans to stage a false flag operation against Ukraine, given Washingtonâ€™s mastery of such actions, the Russian Embassy in Washington has said.Appearing before the United Nations Security Council in February 2003 to make the US case for war in Iraq, then-Bush-era Secretary of State Powell famously held up a model vial of anthrax, citing it as evidence of the kinds of chemical and biological weapons being created by Saddam Husseinâ€™s regime. The US proceeded with its invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Weapons of mass destruction were never found, and Powell later dubbed the speech a â€œgreat intelligence failure.â€ His speech, and the famous image of him holding up the vial, has since become a universal symbol representing false pretexts serving as a justification for war.The Russian Embassyâ€™s tweets follow remarks by Department of Defence spokesman John Kirby on Thursday claiming that the Pentagon had â€œinformationâ€ that Russia was preparing to â€œfabricate a pretextâ€ which would allow it to invade Ukraine, with options purportedly including â€œplanning to stage a fake attack by Ukrainian military or intelligence forces against Russian sovereign territory or against Russian-speaking people, to therefore justify their actionâ€ and recording a â€œvery graphic propaganda videoâ€ to serve as fake evidence.State Department spokesman Ned Price echoed Kirbyâ€™s claims about a Russian â€œpropaganda videoâ€ in his own presser Thursday, but was confronted by Associated Press reporter Matt Lee, who accused Price of getting into â€œAlex Jones territoryâ€ conspiracy theories of â€œcrisis actorsâ€ and demanding sources. Price told the reporter that the US assertion about a Russian video fake was â€œderived from information known to the US government, intelligence information that we have declassified,â€ but provided no further details.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov blasted US officials over the â€œpropaganda videoâ€ claims on Friday. â€œI have looked on the internet about some statements by the State Department that Russia is preparing fake videos of an alleged attack by Ukrainian troops on the Donbass. The delusional nature of such fabrications, and there are more and more of them every day, is obvious to any more or less experienced political scientist,â€ he said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov echoed the Russian foreign minister. â€œI wouldnâ€™t recommend taking anyoneâ€™s word, especially that of the State Department, when it comes to these issues,â€ he said.Dmitri Polyanskiy, Russiaâ€™s deputy ambassador to the UN, poked fun at Price over his exchange with Lee. â€œHow rude of Matt Lee to ask @StateDeptSpox for evidence to back up allegations that bloody Russians plan a false-flag operation in Ukraine? How dare he? Doesnâ€™t he known two rules: [1:] US officials never lie. [2:] When they do lie (like with WMD in Iraq), itâ€™s for a noble cause,â€ the diplomat quipped.Coincidentally, US officials' claims that Russia is preparing video fakes have been followed by reports coming out of the war-torn Donbass region in east Ukraine that Western media has been embedded with Ukrainian military units to create their own false reporting.On Friday, a spokesman from the Lugansk Peopleâ€™s Militia â€“ one of the two paramilitary forces fighting against Kiev forces in eastern Ukraine, announced that militia intelligence had detected the presence of media from the US, the UK and Estonia alongside the 95th brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces â€“ with these media reportedly tasked with creating fake stories.The back-and-forth claims about fake videos and provocations comes amid the broader tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine â€“and months of claims by the US and its allies that Moscow is preparing to invade its neighbour. The Russian side has vehemently dismissed these claims, accusing the West of deliberately pumping up tensions to justify the further buildup of NATO troops and equipment near Russiaâ€™s borders, and to rationalise new sanctions against Moscow.On Wednesday, the Pentagon announced that 1,000 US troops in Germany would be transferred to Romania, with 2,000 more to be redeployed from the continental United States to Germany and Poland. Polish officials announced late Thursday that the first troops from the new US contingent had already begun arriving in the country.

Earlier in the day, Russia and China issued a joint statement following talks between presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping in Beijing.""The joint statement is quite a remarkable document. It shows tremendous commonality of purpose between China and Russia in terms of their visions for a post-pandemic world order. In addition, the statement does indicate Beijingâ€™s support for Moscow on some specific issues. For instance, it explicitly opposes NATOâ€™s enlargement, supports Russian proposals for security guarantees in Europe and opposes deployment of US ground-based missiles in Asia-Pacific and Europe,"" Manoj Kewalramani, the chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Program at the Takshashila Institution, told Sputnik on Friday.The expert added as a caveat that common purposes do not necessarily translate into shared approaches and policies, noting that Moscow and Beijing also have different interests in the Indo-Pacific and Europe.Various US policies, including the creation of the AUKUS defense partnership, have played their part, but other factors have prompted this development as well, the expert said.Tensions between Russia and the United States have escalated over the past several months after Russia was accused of building up troops near the Ukrainian border and allegedly preparing for an invasion. Moscow has denied the accusations, pointing to NATO's military activity near Russian borders, which it deems a threat to its national security.On Monday, the UN Security Council voted to proceed with a public meeting on Ukraine, with Russia and China opposing the move. Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Zhang Jun said that China does not agree that Russia's deployment of troops near the Ukrainian border undermines international security and called NATO's expansion ""a problem difficult to circumvent.""In December, Moscow published its proposals for the United States and NATO on security guarantees. The proposals, if agreed to, would prevent NATO from expanding in Eastern Europe and prohibit the US and Russia from deploying intermediate and shorter-range missiles within striking distance of each other's territory, among other terms.

Weekly Wrap Up; Croatian President Slams NATO Intransigence; State Dept. Spokesman Gets Challenged State Department spokesman Ned Price was challenged by a US journalist as he pushed new unsubstantiated assertions regarding Russia perpetrating false flag operations in Ukraine.

Caleb Maupin, journalist and political analyst, joins us to review the important stories for the week. The president of Croatia made it clear that he opposes NATO's intransigence in the current security standoff with Russia. Also, the Biden Administration has decided to drop the word ""imminent"" regarding their claims of an upcoming Russian invasion of Ukraine, and McCarthyism has risen its ugly head again in the US.Prof. Linwood Tauheed, associate professor of economics at the University of Missouri- Kansas City, joins us to discuss the economy. US companies shed over 300,000 jobs during the Omicron surge, and the economy added over 400,000 jobs as a whole. Also, the left flank of the Democratic Party is furious over a proposal to means test the child tax credit, and the Presidents of Russia and China meet to challenge US hegemony.Prof. Ben Burgis joins us to discuss domestic issues. The Biden administration is looking to address the open SCOTUS seat. Also, we discuss the dynamics of the Supreme Court and the potential troubles for getting a selection through the Senate.Dan Lazare, investigative journalist and author of ""The Velvet Coup: The Constitution, the Supreme Court and the Decline of American Democracy,"" and Jim Kavanagh, writer at thepolemicist.net and CounterPunch and the author of ""The American Farce Unravels: Shreds of January 6th,"" join us to discuss this week's important stories. State Department spokesman Ned Price was challenged by a US journalist as he pushed new unsubstantiated assertions regarding Russia perpetrating false flag operations in Ukraine. Also, the US is unhappy with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the John Durham investigation seems to be challenging some commonly held beliefs about the Russiagate investigation.Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst and co-founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, and Scott Ritter, former UN weapon inspector in Iraq, join us to discuss international politics. The presidents of Russia and China are meeting and discussing their options if the US levies heavy sanctions against either of them. Also, Edward Snowden is slamming the US Justice Department for not holding the NSA responsible for needlessly spying on American citizens, and top Democrats are pushing back against returning to the JCPOA.We'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.com

President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan has contracted Omicron. According to his statement on Twitter, the COVID tests he and his wife took earlier have come back positive.""Today, the result of our COVID-19 test, which I took with my wife after mild symptoms, turned out to be positive. We are having a mild case of the disease that we have learned is an Omicron variant. We're on our mission. We will continue working from home. We are waiting for your prayers,"" the Turkish President wrote.Earlier this week, Erdogan and his wife paid a visit to Kiev where the Turkish President met his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to discuss the ongoing tensions in Ukraine. Erdogan repeatedly offered Zelensky his help in mediating the crisis, which the Ukrainian President accepted. Erdogan also suggested hosting a meeting between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Erdogan, the US and its Western allies have not done anything to resolve the Russia-Ukraine crisis.Turkey shares a maritime border with both Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea. While commenting on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Erdogan said that as a NATO member, Turkey would do what is necessary if Russia invades Ukraine, but at the same time, he has spoken against the sanctions on Russia which have been threatened by the US, UK and the EU.Russia has repeatedly dismissed the West's allegations that it has been plotting to invade Ukraine, blaming the US for hyping the ""Russian threat"" topic. Moscow has been stressing that NATO's increased military activity close to Russia's borders as well as active financial and military assistance to Ukraine pose a threat to Russia's national security. In an effort to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine, Russia submitted its security guarantee proposals to the US and NATO in December. Keeping Ukraine out of NATO was among the key requirements outlined by Moscow but the US and NATO responded by saying they would not accept this condition and refused to sacrifice the bloc's so-called ""open-door policy"".

""Germany is one of Americaâ€™s closest allies,"" US President Joe Biden said during a meeting with Scholz at the White House on Monday. ""Weâ€™re working in lockstep to further deter Russian aggression in Europe and to address the challenges posed by China and to promote stability in the Western Balkans.""Scholzâ€™s visit comes days after his government refused to send weapons to Ukraine or to allow Estonia, another NATO ally, to send old East German howitzer artillery pieces to Kiev. While the move drew widespread criticism, Scholz pledged NATO would â€œact jointlyâ€ in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine and that Moscow would â€œpay a high priceâ€ for the move.Still, in an interview with the Washington Post on Sunday, the German chancellor refused to commit to cutting off the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has not yet been turned on but would bring gas from Russia to Germany. The Biden administration has pressured Berlin to do so, and the project was strongly opposed by the previous Trump administration, which threatened Germany with sanctions over the project.The US has claimed that Russian troops deployed to Belarus and in southern Russia are a sign Putin is planning an invasion of Ukraine. However, leaders in both Moscow and Kiev have dismissed the possibility. Several European NATO partners have also taken a more middling position, seeking a different tone in talks with Russia than the United States, which has remained intransigent and refused to acknowledge Russian security concerns, which Moscow has said would help to reduce tensions across the region.Those concerns, articulated in a proposal submitted in December 2021, include halting NATOâ€™s further eastward expansion, including precluding the possibility that Ukraine will join the alliance, as well as the potential stationing of offensive weapons in Ukraine by NATO. So far, NATO has flatly dismissed the idea of changing its so-called â€œopen doorâ€ policy, although such a policy is not written into NATOâ€™s constitution.A day prior, Biden also spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron, who traveled to Moscow on Monday to meet with Putin before going to Kiev to see Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the following day. Macron has portrayed himself as a mediator between Washingtonâ€™s bellicose posturing and Moscowâ€™s insistence that its security concerns be addressed.""I see how much effort the current leadership of France and the president personally is applying in order to solve the crisis related to providing equal security in Europe [from] a serious historical perspective,"" Putin said.When asked by a reporter about the administrationâ€™s position on the Macron-Putin meeting on Monday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said, â€œwe are in close contact with the French, of course the Germans, and all of our NATO partners and allies.â€Late last month, the US placed 8,500 troops on â€œheightened alertâ€ to be prepared to deploy to Europe in a few as five days, should the situation arise. The Pentagon also shifted 2,000 troops already in Europe further east into nations closer to Russia.

During closed-door sessions, US President Joe Biden took jabs at some of his counterparts involved in coordinating a response to possible Russian ""aggression"" in Ukraine, NBC News has quoted unnamed sources as saying.Referring to French President Emmanuel Macron, POTUS argued that he wants to be Charles de Gaulle, according to the insiders.The US president also ostensibly lashed out at Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him ""a guy with nukes and no friends"".""President Biden is pleased with the exceptional cooperation between the US and our European allies and partners, including as we address the ongoing crisis of Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's borders"", Horne added.Scholz-Biden TalksThe remarks come a few says after Biden told reporters during a joint news conference with Scholz in the wake of their talks that ""there is no doubt about Germany's partnership with the United States. None"".Scholz, however, did not earlier publicly commit to Biden's pledge to ""bring an end"" to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, only saying that Berlin and Washington ""are acting together"". According to the German chancellor, both sides are ""absolutely united"", and they ""will not be taking different steps"".In a separate development this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin sat down with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in Moscow to discuss the situation around Ukraine.He recalled that during his meeting with Macron, Putin expressed regret that the responses by the US and NATO to Russia's security guarantee proposals are secondary and do not address the fundamental issue and that therefore, the topic remains open.Russia's Security Guarantee Proposals Moscow put forward draft agreements on security guarantees to NATO and the US in December 2021. The documents include a number of binding commitments aimed at considerably easing tensions between Moscow and the West. They contain calls on the parties not to deploy troops, missile systems, aircraft, and warships in areas where they may be considered a threat to the other side.The US and NATO are also asked to halt the alliance's eastward expansion, and scrap plans to incorporate Ukraine or any other country of the former USSR into NATO. Additionally, the alliance is urged to limit the deployment of arms and troops along its eastern flank â€“ specifically in those countries that joined NATO after the end of the Cold War.Tensions over Ukraine persist amid Western media reports claiming that Moscow is planning to ""invade"" the country, which the Kremlin denounced as ""alarmism"". Russia has repeatedly underscored that it has the right to deploy forces within its own territory at its own discretion, also pointing to NATO's growing military activity near Russia's borders.

US National Security Council officials, speaking to Politico, have raised eyebrows over the scope of intelligence the Biden administration has been ""leaking"" to the press. They are stressing the intel could harm the nation's standing should the info turn out to be wrong.The source claimed that the more intelligence the White House releases, the more likely that Russian operatives can trace the sources and leaked methods used to obtain this covert information.The insider argued that revealing Russia's purported ""grey zone"" tactics makes sense, but that ""it's the volume of specific stuff that creates a problem, not any one piece of information per se"".The claims were echoed by a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer, who told Politico that he was concerned about ""the long-term credibility"" of US intelligence ""with all of these select declassifications"".Russia Slams US Media Reports About 'Invasion' of Ukraine 'Within Days'This comes a couple of days after The Washington Post and The New York Times quoted unnamed US officials as claiming that Moscow ""could invade Ukraine within days"" and that the ""invasion"" may cause 50,000 civilian deaths in the country. The officials also argued that up to 25,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 10,000 Russian military personnel could be killed as a result of the ""invasion"".Russia's First Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy was quick to respond by tweeting that the ""madness and scaremongering"" from the US ""continues"".The remarks were preceded by the US news agency Bloomberg publishing what appeared to be a pre-written headline claiming that Russia had launched an invasion of Ukraine. Bloomberg kept the fake headline on its website for around half an hour before deleting it and admitting the mistake, saying the circumstances of the incident were now under investigation.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reacted to the fake Bloomberg announcement by calling on all parties to avoid provocative rhetoric and warning that it could aggravate the situation.Tensions surrounding Ukraine have been simmering over recent months, fuelled by unproven Western claims that Russia plans to invade the country. The Kremlin has vehemently rejected the allegations, slamming them as a pretext for NATO to expand its expansion eastward and emphasising its right to relocate troops within Russia's borders at its own discretion.

Persisent efforts are needed to ensure that the US and NATO provide comprehensive legal guarantees of Russia's security, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his address marking Diplomat's Day.The president pointed at the ""turbulent and tense"" situation in the world, that calls for additional efforts in responding to emerging threats and challenges. Aside from the need for legal security guarantees, Putin underlined the importance of the United Nations' role.Putin praised the work of the Russian Foreign Ministry in the field of protecting national security interests, pointing at how the efforts of Russian diplomats help to solve regional conflicts and crises while also broadening contacts between Moscow and different international partners from all continents.The issue of Russian security concerns remains one of the most acute for the national diplomats, with their efforts to de-escalate tensions over Ukraine and reach an understanding on Moscow's security ""red lines"" still ongoing despite the West continuing to roll out accusations and threats of sanctions.Over the past several weeks, the narrative of the alleged ""Russian invasion of Ukraine"" has been fuelled by Western diplomats and media outlets. According to the allegations, Russia is ""amassing troops"" on the border with Ukraine while plotting to ""invade"" the neighbouring country - claims that Moscow has dismissed numerous times as groundless provocations.In December, Russia rolled out its security proposals to the West, making specific demands that NATO refrain from expanding eastwards or deploying offensive weapons in countries neighbouring Russia. The response from the US and NATO took a while; in the end they rejected Moscow's core demands.The security negotiations are still far from over. Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations office in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, has told Sputnik that Moscow is ""morally and organisationally ready to hold new rounds if they are required"", although it is unclear when Russia and the US will meet face-to-face in Geneva again.Earlier in the week, French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Moscow to hold extensive talks with his Russian counterpart. The talks, according to Macron, were wrapped up with the two sides managing to find common ground concerning Ukraine. Later, on 15 February, Putin is also expected to hold talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the situation around Ukraine.While many observers (both from Russia and from the West) have praised the efforts by Macron and Scholz to engage in the de-escalation of tensions, there was less enthusiasm from Washington. According to NBC News, US President Joe Biden has already taken jabs at his EU allies for trying to reach an understanding with Russia. The American president reportedly said that Scholz is no Angela Merkel, and Macron wants to be Charles de Gaulle; Russian President Putin, in his turn, was purportedly described by Biden as ""a guy with nukes and no friends"".

As Boris Johnson arrived, hundreds of more British troops were being deployed in the Eastern European country as well as in neighboring Baltic states.The plucky message: Britain is defending Europe from those nasty Russian hordes. This plays on the overblown notion that Britain won the Second World War against Nazi Germany, even though the Third Reich was in fact built up by British ruling circles and capitalists during the 1930s.Johnson went on to accuse Russia of being a bully and urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to â€œde-escalateâ€ military tensions.This week Russian forces are conducting scheduled military exercises in Belarus which neighbors Poland to the East.From his remarks, it seems like the British leader thinks that Russian troops are now going to invade Poland. For weeks now, Johnsonâ€™s government has been amping up the Biden administrationâ€™s claims that Russia was going to imminently invade Ukraine. Those claims have failed to materialize which is consistent with repeated denials by Moscow of having any plans to attack Ukraine.Russia and the United Nations have condemned the war hysteria being drummed up by Washington and London through baseless speculation about imminent aggression against Ukraine.The United States and Britain have both withdrawn their embassy staff from Ukraine. President Joe Biden this week advised any American citizens in the country to â€œget out nowâ€.The scaremongering by the Americans and British seems to be aimed at creating a conflict with Russia, with Ukraine as a proxy.Rudenko said the Anglo-American-led NATO alliance was using tensions over Ukraine as a way to â€œcontainâ€ Russia by undermining its defense and economic capabilities.Despite their best malevolent efforts, Washington and London have so far failed to precipitate a full-blown war in Ukraine involving Russia. American and British officials have said they envisage Ukraine becoming another Afghanistan quagmire for Russia. But in spite of the goading, Moscow is not taking the bait. It remains steadfast in its position that it has no intention to escalate militarily over Ukraine. Thatâ€™s what Putin again told French President Emmanuel Macron this week.This is why British and American lecturing to Russia about the need to de-escalate and â€œchoose the path of diplomacyâ€ sounds ridiculous. This lecturing was reiterated by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss when she was in Moscow this week. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov lampooned such arrogant ultimatums as a â€œdead-end streetâ€.Moscow is being admonished to de-escalate troops within its borders while British and American troops are massing near Russian territory, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and in between. British special forces are reportedly being deployed in Ukraine to train militia in techniques of sabotage, assassination and other forms of terrorism. British and Polish mercenaries are reportedly working together.It is not Russia that needs to â€œchoose the path of diplomacyâ€; it is Washington and London. The Americans and British are deliberately winding up the provocations in Ukraine and Eastern Europe in order to militarize relations with Russia beyond diplomatic repair. This is part of their containment strategy.Rather than proper diplomatic negotiations between Moscow and the US-led NATO bloc on creating a mutual security treaty for Europe, the Anglo-American axis is cynically stoking tensions to preclude any reasonable dialogue. Peace and normal relations with Russia are anathemas because there is no profit for their warmongering industries that are so essential to the functioning of Anglo-American capitalism.Having failed to predict a Russian invasion of Ukraine, it seems now that Washington and London have decided to double down by casting a shadow of fear over all of Eastern Europe. And the Russophobic regimes in Poland and Baltic states are all too willing to indulge this criminal grandstanding of hostilities.Boris Johnson flying unexpectedly to Warsaw this week along with hundreds of British troops is all part of the despicable drama and psyops. The British premier avowedly models himself on Britainâ€™s wartime hero Winston Churchill. He is also a proven liar and political con artist. While Johnson desperately struggles to stave off being sacked by his own party over non-stop scandals in Downing Street, he is prancing around Eastern Europe acting like a noble defender against â€œRussian invasionâ€.

Ben Wallace has announced Britain's readiness to discuss Russia's security proposals with Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.""I hope that by speaking today and starting that relationship, that was at zero percent, we can resolve a number of issues that you've raised,"" Wallace said, speaking to Shoigu in Moscow on Friday.Shoigu asked Wallace to explain why the UK has deployed its special forces troops in Ukraine, and why the West was ""gorging"" Kiev with weapons deliveries.The Russian defence chief constituted the military-political situation in Europe as becoming ""more and more tense,"" stressing that this was taking place by no fault of Moscow. ""Unfortunately, the level of our cooperation is close to zero and is heading below zero; this is something we would like to avoid,"" Shoigu stressed.""Therefore, I really hope to have the opportunity to discuss the most pressing issues with you without any escalation and raising of the temperature even higher in relations between Russia and NATO countries, and especially with the United Kingdom, taking into account our shared historical experience of cooperation and combat cooperation,"" Shoigu told his British counterpart.The Russian defence chief also informed British counterpart that Russia has considered how to respond to the US and NATO following their rejection of Moscow's security guarantee proposals, and said he believes ""we will respond in the near future.""The British defence chief further that the troops the UK has in Ukraine for training purposes would be returning home soon, and that London has ""no plans"" to send 600 special forces troops into the country. He suggested that the weapons systems sent to Kiev by Britain were ""for protection,"" and also claimed that NATO is a ""defensive"" alliance that is ""not seeking confrontation.""Wallace and other UK defence officials arrived in Moscow on Friday for talks with Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov - the Chief of Russian General Staff. The visit comes following icy negotiations between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Thursday.A source told Britain's The Times newspaper earlier Friday that Wallace's visit would include threats to slap new sanctions on Russia in the event that it ""invaded"" Ukraine, and demands that Moscow ""pull back"" troops situated near the border with that country.The UK, the US and other NATO countries have spent months claiming that Russia was on the brink of invading Ukraine, citing the estimated ""100,000 troops"" near the frontier. Russian officials have dismissed the ""invasion"" claims, and accused the Western bloc of deliberately stoking tensions to justify putting more troops and offensive weaponry in Eastern Europe. The Biden administration appeared to confirm Moscow's fears earlier this month, announcing the deployment of thousands more US troops in countries near Russia in the Baltic and Black Sea regions. On Friday, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg announced that the alliance was considering the creation of new battle groups in Black Sea region countries.Russia proposed a pair of draft security treaties to the US and NATO in mid-December, calling for a mutual pullback of troops, missiles, aircraft and warships from areas where they may be considered a threat to the other side, and requesting that the Western bloc halt its attempts to expand into Ukraine and other post-Soviet republics. Washington and NATO formally rejected Moscow's proposals late last month, saying that it the Western alliance would not give up on its 'open door' policy for countries seeking to join.

India is on thin ice regarding the ongoing Ukrainian crisis, having abstained from voting on the US-led move at the UN Security Council on 31 January, and asserting that the ""legitimate security interests of all countries"" should be considered. New Delhi also urged the countries involved to de-escalate tensions through peaceful dialogue.So far, the US and UK have taken a hawkish stand on the crisis, whereas countries such as France and Turkey have rushed to mediate to ease the tensions.India's trade and strategic interests are highly dependent on the US and European nations although two-thirds of the Indian Army's arms and weapons are of Soviet origin, making it heavily reliant on Russia and Ukraine as well.New Delhi may face problems in making payments related to trade and defence-equipment purchase as the US is threatening Russia with ""the mother of all sanctions"" if it invades Ukraine, something Moscow has long said is not going to happen.Sputnik spoke with Aditya Pareek, a research analyst at the Takshashila Institution, a Bengaluru-based independent think-tank and public-policy school, about how the ongoing tensions will affect India's interests in general.Sputnik: What kind of difficulties may India face if tensions escalate, considering New Delhi has a massive military equipment dependency on Russia as well as Ukraine?Aditya Pareek: In the case of a conflict involving Russia and Ukraine, India would have to balance its ties with both countries. India really doesn't want to alienate Ukraine, as much of its military equipment of Soviet/Russian origin also depends on components sourced from Ukraine.The reliance extends to gas turbines installed in many Indian Navy warships, AN-32 transport aircraft, which need Ukrainian facilities, and components and expertise for their maintenance and overhaul. India's Russian-origin Mi 17 and Mi 35 helicopter fleets also depend on Ukrainian engines.With Ukrainian collaboration, India has also developed a semi-cryogenic engine for its space programme.It is hard to predict how much of this military-technical capability Ukraine will retain for its own use, should there be conflict between it and Russia.Sputnik: Will this issue also pose challenges of strategic balancing between Russia and the US for New Delhi?Aditya Pareek: India will probably be pressured by the US not to make any more defence deals with Russia. India's present approach to selecting defence systems that fit its technical requirements best at the right price may cause the US to regard India as an unreliable ally. The US has yet to confirm whether India will get a waiver on the S-400 deal with Russia. If a narrative painting India as a potential enabler of Russia is spun in the US with filibusters and mass media dissemination, there is a chance that public opinion could turn against India receiving a CAATSA waiver.Sputnik: How similar is the present scenario for India to 2014 when Crimea's reunification with Russia happened?Aditya Pareek: It is uncertain whether India would continue to recognise Russian interests, or whether there would be a limit past which India would no longer be able to negotiate a balance between supporting Russia without alienating Ukraine. China's response to Crimea coming under Russian control has been more neutral than India's position of implicit support for Russia. In the event of any more territory changing hands, Russia may find itself internationally isolated. India could use the opportunity to drive a wedge between its ally Russia and its strategic adversary China, thus securing its own national interest.Sputnik: In the event of additional sanctions on Russia, what are the options before New Delhi in making payments for trade/defence transactions?Aditya Pareek: India and Russia have made arrangements to get around US sanctions, such as settling their transactions in their national currencies. This can be taken one step further in the digital era, as India and Russia have both made plans to introduce digital currencies, which could facilitate international trade without using the US dollar. Some Indian banks can also be persuaded to set up specially designated branches in Russia to handle transactions. But the fear of counter-sanctions by the US on these banks may stymie this option. In the unlikely scenario that Russia is cut off from SWIFT, some Indian banks may also be able to accommodate fund transfers from Russia by signing up for Russia's own SPFS.Sputnik: Could India play the role of mediator?Aditya Pareek: It is likely that India could emerge as mediator as New Delhi's own pragmatic energy security, military-technical and economic interests are spread out across former Soviet states. India will probably be able to persuade Moscow and Kiev - as well as Washington and its allies - to negotiate the security situation in Europe, looking at the bigger picture.Sputnik: There is also a lingering border stand-off between India and China. In case of conflict between the US-led NATO and Russia, is there anything to worry about for India along the northern border?Aditya Pareek: Although the chance of a full-fledged war between India and China is low, if there were to be a conflict between NATO and Russia, it could result in the US de-prioritising China and the Indo-Pacific. This could, in turn, embolden China which could be tempted to perpetrate an incident on the Line of Actual Control to test Indian forces. It might not shift the centre of gravity in Ladakh but will raise tensions extraordinarily.Sputnik: What implications will the US engagement in the Ukrainian crisis have on the Indo-Pacific strategy of the US and its allies?Aditya Pareek: There is a chance that the US' attention can be drawn to Europe and away from Asia, which might embolden China into acting more assertively in Taiwan straits, in the South China Sea or Indo-Pacific, while the US and its western allies in NATO concentrate on Russia in Europe.Japan has seen increased activity around its northern frontier in the form of joint military drills and bomber flights by Russian and Chinese forces. But it is unlikely a co-ordinated kinetic offensive would be launched by Russia and China, and any prospective military moves will be strategic signalling for Japan to treat with restraint.

""Today, the @StateDept ordered non-emergency U.S. employees at the Embassy to depart due to continued reports of a Russian military build-up on the border with Ukraine, indicating potential for significant military action,"" the embassy tweeted.""Despite the reduction in diplomatic staff, the core embassy team, our dedicated Ukrainian colleagues, and StateDept and U.S. personnel around the world will continue relentless diplomatic and assistance efforts in support of Ukraineâ€™s security, democracy, and prosperity,"" the embassy also said. In a separate development, UK Ambassador to Ukraine Melinda Simmons said that she continues running the embassy in Kiev together with the core personnel despite growing tensions and the departure of families of diplomats.""I am staying in Kyiv and continue to work there with a core team. The embassy remains operational,"" Simmons wrote on Twitter.On Monday, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia informed it about their intention to evacuate families of diplomats. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that member countries of the bloc are not going to evacuate their diplomatic staff from Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Belgian Foreign Ministry has updated its travel advice, calling on Belgian citizens to leave Ukraine, adding that evacuation cannot be guaranteed if tensions escalate. ""All trips to the entire Ukrainian territory are strongly discouraged. Nationals who are currently in Ukraine and whose presence is not absolutely necessary are strongly advised to leave the country,"" the new travel advice read. The ministry advised citizens to modify their travel plans depending on the security situation in Ukraine as tensions with Russia allegedly grow, adding that should the situation deteriorate, disruptions might affect air travel, internet and phone connectivity in Ukraine.Germany has announced it is reducing the number of embassy staff in Kiev and moving its consulate general to Lvov. ""We will keep our embassy in Kiev open but will reduce the number of diplomatic staff stationed there. Our consulate general for Donetsk, which has been based in Dnipro since 2014, will be temporarily relocated to Lviv,"" Baerbock said, as quoted on the German Foreign Ministry's Twitter account.Earlier, the German Foreign Ministry urged citizens to leave Ukraine unless remaining there is absolutely necessary. Ukraine and several Western countries have been accusing Russia of military build-up along the Ukrainian border in an alleged preparation of invasion. Russia has rejected these accusations. On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia was not threatening anyone but was being threatened. He added that Moscow is not excluding that the ""hysteria"" around Ukraine which is being fuelled by the West is aimed at concealing Kiev's plans to sabotage the Minsk Agreements on Donbass. Moreover, Russia warned Western counterparts supplying lethal weaponry to Ukraine that the latter could use it against the breakaway parts of the Donbass region.

Hillary Clinton's campaign paid a tech company to ""inflitrate"" Trump Tower and later the White House servers in order to forge a ""narrative"" that would link then-candidate Donald Trump to Russia, Special Counsel John Durham has revealed in a new filing.A new motion filed by Durham on 11 February is looking at the potential conflict of interest in regard to former Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussman, who was charged with making false statements to a federal agent (a charge Sussman pleaded not guilty to).Sussman said he was not doing work ""for any client"" in September 2016, when he looked into the alleged ""covert communication channel"" between the Trump campaign and Russia's Alfa Bank. Durham's motion, however, argued that he ""had assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including a technology executive (Tech Executive 1) at a U.S.-based internet company (Internet Company 1) and the Clinton campaign"".Durham went on to assert that Sussman ""repeatedly billed the Clinton Campaign for his work"" regarding the purported ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian bank.Sussman had also allegedly met and communicated with a former General Counsel to the Clinton campaign, who, according to Fox News' sources, was Marc Elias of the law firm Perkins Coie. According to the motion, the Clinton campaign assembled a team of tech executives, attorneys and cyber researchers who allegedly worked to create a false narrative linking Trump to Russia.Durham accused the tech executive allegedly hired by the Clinton campaign of ""[exploiting] his access to non-public and/or proprietary Internet data"". Among those affected by the actions were ""a particular healthcare provider"", Trump Tower, Trump's Central Park West apartment building and even the Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP).The Durham findings illustrate that the Clinton campaign funded an attempt ""to orchestrate a criminal enterprise to fabricate a connection between President Trump and Russia"", as put by former chief investigator of the Trump-Russia probe for the House Intelligence Committee under Devin Nunes, Kash Patel.The now infamous dossier crafter by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele also claimed that Donald Trump ""colluded"" with the Kremlin during the 2016 presidential election. The dossier, funded the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through Perkins Coie, was later debunked by the authorities.Trump ResponseThe new Durham filing quickly made waves, drawing reactions from many political figures, the former US president among them. Commenting on the new findings, Donald Trump said they were part of ""a scandal far greater in scope and magnitude than Watergate"". According to him, ""those who were involved in and knew about this spying operation should be subject to criminal prosecution"".He noted that ""in a stronger period of time in our country, this crime would have been punishable by death."" Additionally, the former president demanded that ""reparations"" should be paid to those affected by the alleged plot by the Clinton campaign.The ex-president's son, Donald Trump Jr, also reacted to the new motion by Durham.Hillary Clinton has been mum on the new spin in the Durham investigation.Durham ProbeSpecial Counsel John Durham was appointed by then-Attorney General William Barr to lead a review into the ""Russiagate"" investigation launched by the FBI. Durham aims to determine whether the FBI probe into the allegations of Trump ""colluding"" with the Kremlin were legal.The Special Counsel's work has been praised by Trump, who only lamented that Durham's findings did not emerge before he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden.The former president has dismissed ""Russiagate"" as a hoax concocted to sabotage him and his political career. Moscow, in its turn, has repeatedly underlined that it had never interfered with the domestic affairs of the US and the 2016 presidential election in particular.As of now, practically all allegations referring to the purported ""collusion"" have been dismissed or called into question. The infamous Steele dossier has been debunked, and a report by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller also found no evidence of what was actively promoted as Russian efforts to ""meddle"" in the 2016 election. After Mueller completed his report, Durham took over the investigation into the origins of the FBI ""Russiagate"" probe that kicked off in July 2016.

The US is not considering ""preemptive"" sanctions against Russia over the crisis in Ukraine, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has announced.""If it's a deterrent and you use it before the aggression is made or the transgression is made, then you lose your deterrent effect,"" Kirby said, speaking to Fox News on Sunday.Pressed to confirm that the US would not impose sanctions in the absence of Russian ""aggression,"" Kirby indicated that ""right now we are not considering a preemptive sanction regime.""Kirby's comments echoed those made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month when the secretary suggested that if new sanctions were ""triggered now,"" the US would ""lose the deterrent effect.""Russia has dismissed that any ""sanctions deterrent"" has any influence on its calculations, and has vocally dismissed months of claims by Western officials and media that it plans to attack Ukraine. Russian officials have expressed concerns that the US is using the invasion fears as a pretext to beef up its military presence in Eastern Europe, and has slammed Washington over alleged collusion with media to ramp up anti-Russian hysteria. At the same time, Moscow has expressed concerns that the US or its allies may be preparing some kind of provocation against the self-proclaimed Donbass republics to reignite the frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine.Earlier this week, US media reported that Senate negotiations on a so-called ""mother of all sanctions"" bill against Russia were ongoing, and were running against the clock of a 21 February deadline, when the Senate will go into recess for a week.Democrat Senator Jeanne Shaheen recently told a Washington think tank that sanctions aimed at holding Vladimir Putin ""accountable"" were ""very close"" to an agreement between Democrat and Republican members of the Foreign Relations Committee. Last month, Republican Senator Joni Ernst urged for new sanctions against Russia ""now"" to ""show strength and not be in a position of a doctrine of appeasement.""Possible preemptive sanctions could include new personal restrictions on senior Kremlin officials and Russian oligarchs, plus ""Iran-esque"" sanctions on Russia and possibly even an attempt to shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline should Moscow go ahead with an invasion of Ukraine (targeting the pipeline is said to be supported by Republicans, but opposed by Democrats). A Senate aide told CBS News on Friday that President Biden could not stop the Senate-proposed sanctions from being implemented if an invasion did take place.On Friday, US and European Union officials told Reuters that Washington and Brussels were finalizing new restrictions targeting Russian banks, but said that cutting Russia off from the SWIFT interbanking money transfer system was not on the cards thanks to objections from European countries. European countries have expressed concerns that an escalation in Ukraine could disrupt Russian energy supplies flowing to Europe amid already sky-high spot prices and shortages of natural gas in the region.On Thursday, the UK, which has spearheaded efforts among Washington's European allies to ramp up tensions with Russia, published a comprehensive set of sanctions regulations threatening to target the Russian government, ministries, the Central Bank, strategic sectors of the economy including the chemicals, construction, defence, electronics, energy, extractives, financial services, IT and transport, plus individuals and companies doing business with Russia or deemed to be involved in destabilising Ukraine or undermining its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

A Russian invasion of Ukraine may begin any day now but the White House cannot predict the specific day, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has said.Sullivan stressed that the US would not allow Russia to start a ""surprise"" attack against Ukraine, promising to continue to share intelligence and warning the world to be prepared for Moscow to stage a pretext to justify an invasion.""We are prepared to continue to work on diplomacy, but we are also prepared to respond in a united and decisive way with our allies and partners should Russia proceed,"" the top Biden national security official said.In a separate interview with Fox News on Sunday, Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby said he couldn't confirm Friday's report by Politico that Russia would start an invasion of Ukraine on 16 February.""And again, these assessments are coming from a variety of sources, and not exclusively just inside intelligence, but also what we're seeing in plain sight; these more than 100,000 troops now continue to be arrayed against Ukraine's border,"" Kirby said.""I think a mosaic of the intelligence that we're seeing -not speaking to it specifically but uh, but you know we have good sources of intelligence and they're telling us that things are sort of building now to some sort of crescendo opportunity for Mr. Putin,"" the Pentagon spokesman added.Provocation FearsThe officials' comments follow a warning by President Biden on Saturday in a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Moscow would be made to pay ""swift and severe costs"" if it went ahead with its supposed Ukraine invasion plans. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov dismissed the US ""invasion"" claims and charged Washington with ""artificially inflating hysteria.""Also on Saturday, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the US government of colluding with the media to spark a fit of hysteria regarding the situation in Ukraine, warning that the US may be looking for a provocation to spark a conflict in the region.Moscow expressed concerns on Sunday about the decision of several countries to redeploy representatives to the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe's special monitoring mission in Ukraine (SMM). Earlier in the day, a spokesman for the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic warned that the withdrawal of EU, US, and UK representatives from the SMM under the pretext that their safety could not be assured could mean that a large-scale provocation by Kiev or its Western benefactors may be in the offing.US and NATO officials and media began talking about Russia's alleged plans to ""imminently"" invade Ukraine last fall, regularly citing the ""100,000"" Russian troops near the border and quoting reports by unidentified officials to various outlets and calling on diplomats and nationals to evacuate the country. Russia has dismissed that it has any plans to invade its neighbour, calling on Kiev to implement the Minsk Agreements on Ukrainian peace, and suggesting that the West's allegations about Moscow's aggression may be aimed at justifying the further buildup of NATO troops near Russian frontiers. Officials in Kiev have also questioned their Western backers' invasion claims, saying Russia would need far more troops than it currently has near Ukraine to mount a successful invasion, and that Ukrainian intelligence is unaware of such invasion plans.Ukraine Conflict Marks 8th AnniversaryTensions in relations between Russia and the West over Ukraine began in February 2014, when pro-Western political forces backed by ultranationalist fighters overthrew the neutrality-seeking government in Kiev and attempted to push Ukraine toward integration with the European Union and NATO. The coup d'etat prompted authorities in Crimea to hold a referendum on the peninsula's status in March of 2014, with residents voting overwhelmingly to split off from Ukraine's jurisdiction and rejoin Russia. Efforts by independence-seeking forces across eastern and southern Ukraine opposed to the post-coup authorities to similarly split with Kiev led to a military and security crackdown, with activists in cities including Kharkiv and Odessa disappeared or murdered, and troops sent to the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk to crush fledgling pro-independence militia. The latter move sparked a civil war which led to the deaths of at least 13,000 people, and left over 2.5 million people displaced.In February 2015, the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France met in the Belarusian capital of Minsk to sign the Minsk Agreements â€“ stipulating a ceasefire, the pullback of forces from the conflict zone, elections in the breakaway regions and amendments to Ukraine's laws to grant the eastern breakaways broad autonomy in exchange for their return to Kiev's jurisdiction. The ceasefire was successfully implemented (despite regular reports of sniper and artillery fire, troop movements and other violations), but the Ukrainian government has refused to implement the political portion of the deal. Shortly after his election in 2019, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signaled his intent to do implement Minsk, prompting tens of thousands of ultranationalists to flood the streets of Kiev threatening to overthrow the government and forcing him to relent.

Finland could provide financial aid to Ukraine if it is attacked, the country's Prime Minister Sanna Marin has said. The moment came in her monthly press conference from her official residence arranged by national broadcaster Yle.She also said that the situation concerning arms exports was ""more complicated"".In January, The Wall Street Journal reported that Germany had been blocking Estonia from providing Ukraine with artillery that Berlin initially sold Finland in the 1990s and was later sold to Estonia.Speaking about the West's allegations of Russia's ""imminent invasion"" of Ukraine, Marin said that while there is no military threat against Finland, there is ""no place for any kind of thinking based on spheres of influence in Europe"".Finland Prepared to Support Sanctions Despite Economic BlowbackMarin additionally said that Finland is ready to support US-backed EU sanctions against Russia, calling them ""well-coordinated"" measures. Without going into detail, the prime minister said that the sanctions will be both economic and personal.Marin stressed that the West now stands better prepared than in 2014, when it hit Russia with sanctions following Crimea's reunification with Russia.Nevertheless, Marin said that possible sanctions on Russia would have a significant impact on the Finnish economy as well, because it was ""clear"" that Moscow would respond to such measures with counter-sanctions. According to the prime minister, Finland's trade relations with Russia and the effect of likely counter-sanctions have been discussed with the EU, which has acknowledged the nation's special position as Russia's neighbour. Marin even ventured that the responsibility for avoiding sanctions lies with Russia, which can still resolve the situation around Ukraine peacefully.NATO Application 'Unlikely'Asked about Finland joining NATO sometime in the future, Marin replied that there are currently no discussions on applying for membership.Marin stressed that while it is not fully out of the question that Finland could apply during her legislative term, she said it was ""unlikely"".The centre-left coalition led by Marin's Social Democrats is poised to be in power until 2023. The opposition liberal-conservative National Coalition Party, which has been leading opinion polls and won recent municipal and regional elections, has traditionally been more pro-NATO.Nevertheless, Marin emphasised that the decision cannot be influenced by external forces.Fears of Provocation in NATO-Russia Standoff Over UkraineWestern and NATO officials and the media began ratcheting up the narrative about Russia's alleged ""invasion"" plans last autumn, regularly citing the ""massing"" of Russian troops near the border. Russia has dismissed that it has any plans to invade its neighbour, calling on Kiev to implement the Minsk agreements on Ukrainian peace. Moscow even suggested that the West's allegations may be aimed at justifying the further buildup of NATO troops near Russia's borders.Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov dismissed the West's ""invasion"" claims and fired back at Washington over ""artificially inflating hysteria"", while Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned that the US may be looking for a provocation to spark a conflict in the region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved in principle the 10-page written draft response by the Foreign Ministry on security guarantees with the US and NATO. Discussing the West's responses to Moscow's security proposals with Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia prepared its written response to the US and NATO and suggested that Moscow continue talks with the West on security guarantees.Lavrov noted that both the US and NATO are ready to start serious talks on some of the security guarantees mentioned in the Russian proposals.The foreign minister further said that despite the US and NATO's negative response to Russia's key security proposals, their reaction to the secondary issues mentioned in them was more ""constructive in its nature"". He suggested to the president that this section of the response contained proposals for certain measures that might allow the countries to achieve greater military transparency, reduce the risks of war and increase mutual trust.Kremlin Dissatisfied With US, NATO Response to Key Issues in Moscow's Security ProposalsLavrov also stated that Moscow is ""unsatisfied"" with the response that it received to its security proposals from the US. The foreign minister assured Putin that Russia will try to obtain responses to the questions from the security proposals that remained unanswered. Lavrov specifically mentioned a special message that he had sent to colleagues in the West, in which he pointed at the need to uphold the principle of indivisible security.The minister summed up the received response as showing NATO and the EU's attempts to determine the development vector of the entire continent in accordance with their own desires. Lavrov pointed out that the agreement signed by the members of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) strictly forbids any country or groups of states from ""dominating"" the OSCE.Lavrov also said that the Russian Foreign Ministry and colleagues from other ministries have studied the received responses and drew certain conclusions based on them.Tensions Around UkraineMoscow sent its security proposals to the US and NATO amid growing tensions sparked by the West's allegations that Russia is planning an ""invasion"" of Ukraine. The West cited alleged movements by Russian troops towards the border with Ukraine as a source for their concerns.The Kremlin rejected their allegations and stressed that it has the right to move the nation's troops within its own territory as it deems fit. Moscow also pointed at the growing number of NATO troops moving ever closer to the country's borders, including via the inclusion of new Eastern European nations in the alliance.The security proposals, designed by Moscow as a framework to reduce tensions and ensure security and stability in the region, included two key proposals: for NATO not to permit Ukraine to join and to withdraw its forces to the bloc's 1997 borders. The proposals also included a number of secondary issues â€“ such as signing new arms control accords and limiting the scale of military drills on each others' borders.Both the US and NATO strongly rejected Moscow's key proposals insisting on Ukraine's right to choose its alliances, including the North Atlantic bloc. They, however, supported some of the secondary ideas proposing that the Kremlin start a dialogue on arms control and issues concerning the scale of war games.

A British junior defence minister has warned that granting NATO protection to Ukraine would justify Russian fears of Western aggression and could ""fracture"" the military alliance.Writing in The Sunday Times, Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the West should not ""play to the narrative"" Russian President Vladimir Putin ""peddles to the Russian public that NATO is expansionist and set on threatening Russia"".The alliance was founded just after the Second World War by Britain, France, the US, and other Western countries to oppose the Soviet Union, their wartime ally against Nazism. But since the nominal end of the Cold War it has expanded steadily eastwards to include ex-Warsaw Pact members â€” even the former Soviet republics of the Baltic States â€” on Russia's borders.""Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO has deployed beyond its borders to Afghanistan in response to an attack on the United States; played a role in counterinsurgency and counterpiracy missions in sub-Saharan Africa, Iraq, and the Indian Ocean; and played an important part in stabilising the Balkans after the break up of the former Yugoslavia"", Heappey wrote â€” somewhat undermining his claim that ""NATO does not attack others"".Heappey's article came as Ukraine's Ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko suggested that Kiev might drop its application for NATO membership â€” comments which he promptly backtracked on.Ukraine has built up troop deployments near the self-proclaimed people's republics of Donetsk and Lugansk in the east, launching aggressive drone incursions into what the breakaway governments fear is preparation for a new offensive in breach of the Minsk accords. Heappey also acknowledged that the risk of war between the nuclear powers made Western military intervention in Ukraine unthinkable.""We must be crystal clear how volatile the Euro-Atlantic security situation is right now"", he stressed. ""Clarity in our message is essential so that we minimise the risk of miscalculation and escalation"".Heappey's comments stand in contrast to the sabre-rattling by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on her trip to Moscow last Thursday to meet her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.Truss repeated US claims â€” which Moscow has dismissed as propaganda â€” that the Russian Army has amassed ""over 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border"". Meanwhile, Downing Street has insisted that Ukraine has a ""right"" to join NATO.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, Heappey's boss, sounded fewer bellicose notes than Truss' war-trumpet when he met Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on Saturday. Wallace paid his respects at a monument to fallen Soviet soldiers of the Second World War and said that as a former serving officer himself, he did not wish to see more troops sent to their deaths.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has called the events taking place in the Donbass region of Ukraine ""genocide"", as he made comments after meeting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He added that Kiev systematically violates human rights, including by legalising the discrimination of the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine.Putin also commented on the Russian State Duma's passing a motion requesting him to recognise the two self-proclaimed people's republics located in Donbass. He expressed the hope that the Minsk accords are still possible and that it is not too late to implement them.The Russian president went on to criticise Kiev's repeated refusal to implement the Minsk accords or follow the resolutions reached as part of the Normandy format with Germany and France.Commenting further on the Duma's request, Putin said that he will act in the interests of resolving the Donbass issues and keep in mind the unrealised potential of the Minsk agreements' implementation.The Ukrainian government, which came to power as the result of a West-backed coup, has been waging a war against the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics since 2014. The Donbass region rebelled because of fears its Russian-speaking population's right to use whatever language they choose would be infringed by the new nationalist-minded authorities. Their fears proved to be correct several years later.Despite the truce being negotiated via international mediation back in 2015, little progress has been achieved so far. The authorities of the two republics regularly complain that Kiev has broken the ceasefire and is trying to resolve the conflict using military means.Moscow, in turn, repeatedly condemned Kiev's resistance to implementing the Minsk agreements for various reasons. In one of the latest examples, Kiev decided to introduce a bill in parliament that would deny amnesty to those who had fought for the self-proclaimed peopleâ€™s republics once the conflict is over. The Minsk agreements state clearly that such an amnesty must be provided for all people living in the rebellious areas once peace is achieved.

The harsh reality of a stock trader in early 2022 includes being unaware of when and where new panic can hit markets. One day, they might remain stable amid negative COVID-19 news, but the next they could grow on a low-key US Federal Reserve meeting. However, what no trader expected this year was to be tricked by a sarcastic statement made by the Ukrainian president on 14 February.Addressing the ever-increasing hysteria in the media about an ""imminent"" Russian invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky attempted to calm down his compatriots by mocking unsubstantiated media reports of 16 February being the day Moscow would go through with its ""invasion plans"". What he probably did not expect was that his words would be wrongly (and too seriously) understood by investors.Because of how the presidentâ€™s remarks were translated, investors apparently understood them as a sign that Kiev had received intelligence from its Western allies that an invasion would start on 16 February, Bloomberg reported, citing analysts.Soon after Zelensky's statement, the S&P 500 index took a dive at around 2pm (New York time), dropping by 1.2% and likely triggering a lot of stop-loss orders for traders. Oil, in turn, jumped, breaching the $95 per barrel ceiling over fears of fuel shipment disruptions and shortages.Zelensky's adviser Mykhailo Podolyak later clarified his remarks, stressing that the president had spoken ironically and remained sceptical about reports of ""concrete dates"" for a Russian invasion. Following his explanation, the S&P 500 bounced back, still closing in the red, but only by 0.4% compared to the previous day. Oil, in turn, fell back below $95 per barrel.Russia has repeatedly denied having plans to invade Ukraine, either now or in the future. Moscow defended its right to redeploy troops within its territory as it sees fit, as Western countries condemned the deployment of troops near Ukraine's border. According to the Kremlin, the troops were brought in for scheduled drills, and some of them will later return to their home bases.

US Vice President Kamala Harris during her trip to the Munich Conference later this week will ensure the United States is aligned with its allies and partners in Europe on the Ukraine situation, a senior US administration official told reporters.The official also accused Russia of allegedly deploying an additional 7,000 troops near its border with Ukraine over the last several days, adding that Washington and its allies would be ready if there is an invasion.Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov earlier announced that Moscow was withdrawing some of its forces from the border with Ukraine. On the same day, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian President Vladimir Putin that some drills with Belarus had ended while others were continuing as planned. The joint Russia-Belarus drills are expected to finish up on Sunday.Also on Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters that American concerns over an ""incursion into Ukraine"" have not diminished, claiming, ""we are in a window where [Russian President Vladimir] Putin could order an invasion or an attack on Ukraine at a moment's notice"".The West and Kiev have accused Russia of a troop buildup near the Ukrainian border in alleged preparation for an ""invasion"". In response to such claims, Moscow has repeatedly stated it has the right to move its troops within its own territory, while pointing to the increased NATO presence near Russia's borders, which Russia perceives as a clear threat to national security.

The first military units of the Russian Western and Southern military districts have arrived at their permanent bases after drills, Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told reporters on Thursday.Konashenkov added that on Thursday, ""military echelons with heavy military equipment of the units of the Southern Military District, who drilled tasks at training grounds in the Crimea, were transferred by rail over a distance of more than 1,500 kilometres to permanent deployment bases in the Chechen Republic and the Republic of Dagestan"".The remarks come a few days after Konashenkov told reporters that Russia's southern and western military units had started the process of returning troops to their places of permanent deployment after the drills.He spoke as the Russian Defence Ministry published a video of the military vehicles being loaded for return to their permanent bases. The vehicles included includes tanks, AMPVs, as well as self-propelled howitzers. The ministry also posted a clip showing Ð¢-72Bz tanks leaving the site of the drills.On Monday, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin that the Russian military is conducting a number of exercises, and that some of them have already wrapped up, while other drills are close to completion.The developments come amid ongoing Western media reports that Russia is amassing troops at the border, planning an ""imminent invasion"" of Ukraine. Moscow has rejected the allegations as absurd, stressing that the whole ""invasion"" narrative is a pretext for NATO to deploy more troops close to the Russian border.

""A fractured Ukraine is useful for the West, because it gives it greater control over Ukraine, grants it pressure points that enhance its relentless eastward expansion"", says Joseph Oliver Boyd-Barrett, professor emeritus at Bowling Green State University, Ohio. ""Humanitarian goals are merely the West's pretexts for interventions in the sovereign affairs of other nations, rarely the main or even any kind of real motivation"".Russian President Vladimir Putin called the situation in eastern Ukraine's breakaway republics ""genocide"" after his meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on 15 February. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has been going on for over seven years, claiming the lives of more than 13,000 people, according to the UN.Between August and October 2021, in the village of Slavyanoserbsk, in the area of the residential area Sokogorovka Pervomaisk, the village of Vidnoye-1 near Lugansk and on the outskirts of the village of Verkhneshevyrevka, Krasnodonsky district, five mass graves were discovered, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia. The remains of at least 295 civilians, including women, who were killed by indiscriminate shelling by Ukrainian armed forces in 2014, were exhumed.The Donbass civilians are being demonised as ""Russian separatists"" in order to justify the arming of Ukrainian government forces and notorious neo-Nazi battalions by the US and its NATO allies, according to the scholar.Meanwhile, it is Ukraine's ultra-nationalist militias, some of whom joined Ukraine's National Guard, who pose the real security threat to the country, warns Stephen Ebert, US author and political analyst:There's No Alternative to Minsk AgreementsOlaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, who along with Russia are the Normandy Four guarantors, confirmed during their meetings with Vladimir Putin earlier this month that the Minsk accords approved by the UN Security Council in 2015 have no alternative. Despite saying that it backs the Minsk deal, Kiev is refusing to hold a direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk, seeking to refurbish the agreement according to its own vision. It appears that major Western European states and the US have made little if any efforts to pressure Ukraine to adhere to the deal over the last seven years, according to Gagnon.For its part, the Western corporate press has fallen short of reporting the truth about the 2014 coup in Ukraine, atrocities by neo-Nazi battalions, the Minsk agreements as well as the fact that Kiev has recently amassed 150,000 troops up along the line of contact with Donbass in clear defiance of the deal, according to Gagnon.""The media is covering the Minsk agreement, but not any Ukraine violations of it"", echoes John Tures, political science professor at LaGrange College in Georgia. ""If Ukraine is actually preparing to attack the Donbass region now that would be a serious error in judgment on their part"".In December 2021, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that thousands of foreign military instructors and mercenaries had been deployed in Ukraine. The US and its NATO allies have also stepped up their weapons supplies to the Eastern European country. Moscow has repeatedly warned that by boosting military aid to Kiev, the West could encourage the Ukrainian leadership to further snub the Minsk deal and launch a new offensive against Donbass.Why is NATO, US Claiming That Russia is Not Pulling Back?The Russian Defence Ministry reported on 15 February that the southern and western military units had begun returning to their bases of permanent deployment following scheduled drills on the southern border near Ukraine. However, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg refused to call Russia's withdrawal of troops a de-escalation.The Biden administration has cast doubt on Russia's military drawdown, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken claiming that critical Russian units were moving ""toward the border, not away from the border"". Earlier, the US and the UK insisted that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen ""at any time"", citing 15 and 16 February as deadlines for a potential offensive which never materialised. Moscow has repeatedly shredded the ""invasion"" claims as groundless.NATO will sustain the pressure even if Russia withdraws its forces from its southern-western regions, according to Joseph Oliver Boyd-Barrett.The Western media has ""resolutely failed"" to report that Russian military exercises came as a response to highly provocative drills by NATO and Ukraine near Russian borders and in the Black Sea, according to the academic. In November 2021, 10 US strategic bombers rehearsed the option of using nuclear weapons against Russia almost simultaneously from the western and eastern directions during the Global Thunder exercises. The US planes came within 20 km (12.4 miles) of the Russian border, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence.In mid-December 2021, Moscow submitted its draft security agreements to US and NATO officials to ensure European stability. On 26 January 2022, Russia received written responses to its proposals from Washington and the alliance. Both the US and NATO disregarded Moscow's core demands of the legally binding guarantees of the alliance's non-expansion, non-deployment of offensive weapon systems near the Russian border, and the return of the blocâ€™s European capabilities and infrastructure to the 1997 level.

The Russian Foreign Ministry accused NATO on Friday of ""escalation for the sake of escalation"" in the ongoing crisis in Eastern Europe, where the alliance has accused Moscow of planning an invasion of Ukraine.""We hope that negotiations on them will continue. We will insist on NATO stopping its provocative expansion policy, refusing to deploy strike weapons that threaten us near our borders, and returning the configuration of the alliance's forces to the positions of 1997,"" she added.Moscow has denied any intent to invade Ukraine, and the Ukrainian government has likewise said that Russian troops near its borders are insufficient to constitute an invasion threat. Nonetheless, the US government and Western media have continued to claim that such an attack could happen ""at any time,"" and even that Moscow might try and use a ""false flag"" incident to create a casus belli.The US State Department levied just such an accusation on Friday, telling Sputnik that it regards news from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) of explosions and artillery shelling by Ukrainian forces as a ""false flag operation.""""It is also cynical and cruel to use human beings as pawns to distract the world from the fact that Russia is building up its forces in preparation for an attack. Russia is the sole instigator of these tensions and is threatening the people of Ukraine. It has put its troops on Ukraine's borders, and routinely abuses and violates the rights of the people of Donbas and Crimea,"" they added.The DPR and its sister republic, the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR), are breakaway states in the Russophone Donbass region, which declared independence from Kiev in 2014 after a nationalist government came to power and attempted to reduce the status the Russian language as a national language in Ukraine. The eight-year war between them and Kiev has killed at least 14,000 people.Earlier this week, the Russian State Duma passed a resolution calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to recognize the two Donbass republics as independent states, but he has so far declined to do so. Ukraine and NATO have accused Moscow of secretly supporting the rebels, but they have denied any interference in Ukrainian affairs. However, Moscow helped to negotiate the Minsk Protocol peace settlement process with Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

Ukrainian forces have fired 18 120-mm mortar rounds at the village of Zaitsevo, a Donetsk People's Republic-controlled settlement situated on the outskirts of the town of Gorlovka, a DPR representative at the Joint Center on Control and Coordination has told journalists.The deployment of 120-mm mortar systems in the Donbass conflict zone is prohibited under the Minsk Agreements - the peace deal hammered out in early 2015 aimed at enforcing a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and ultimately bringing the civil conflict to a close.The mortar fire comes amid a major escalation of mortar, artillery and small-arms fire along the line of contact between Kiev forces and Donbass militia in the past two days, with both sides reporting dozens of violations of the ceasefire and blaming the other for the violence.Lugansk People's Republic the Trilateral Contact Group representative Rodion Miroshnik warned Friday that the Ukrainian army's deployment of a large amount of tubed artillery on the line of contact would lead to massive casualties if a major military conflagration was started.Miroshnik warned that the Donbass was being pushed toward renewed fighting, since Kiev has shown its lack of readiness to negotiate with the breakaway republics.The leaders of Donetsk and Lugansk ordered an evacuation of their civilian population on Friday, citing the danger of an all-out Ukrainian assault.Speaking to reporters after meeting with his Belarusian counterpart on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated that Kiev must sit down for talks with the Donbass breakaways, and do so as soon as possible. Putin also stressed that the Minsk Agreements were the only way to restore peace and relieve tension in the region.The war in the Donbass began in the spring of 2014, when Kiev sent the military to crush fledgling independence movements created by local residents refusing to accept the authority of new political leaders who came to power on the back of a Western-backed coup d'etat. Between May 2014 and early 2015, up to 13,000 Ukrainian troops, Donbass militiamen and civilians were killed in bloody fighting in the cities, towns, villages and plains of eastern Ukraine. In February 2015, the leaders of Ukraine and three nations acting as guarantors - Russia, Germany and France met in Minsk, Belarus to sign the Minsk peace deal. The comprehensive agreement called for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line, plus local elections in the Donbass and constitutional reform in Kiev granting the self-proclaimed republics broad autonomy. Until now, the ceasefire has generally held, albeit with regularly reported violations, but the Ukrainian government has refused to honour the political portion of the Minsk Agreements, turning the conflict into a frozen civil war.

A formerly classified 1991 document retrieved from the British national archive shows Western states did commit to the non-expansion of NATO eastward, Germanyâ€™s Spiegel reports.The document depicts the talks between high-ranking officials from the United States, the UK, France, and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in Bonne on March 6, 1991. According to the newspaper, it provides evidence that the Western states agreed that membership of Eastern European states in the alliance is unacceptable, meaning that Russiaâ€™s current grievances with NATOâ€™s expansion eastwards are totally justified.The USâ€™ Raymond Seitz reportedly agreed with Chrobog, saying, â€œWe made it clear to the Soviet Union that we will not [capitalize on] the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from Eastern Europe...NATO must not expand eastwards neither officially, nor inofficially.â€For years, Russia has insisted that NATO states broke their vow not to move the military alliance toward the Russian borders. Whatâ€™s more, at the NATO summit in 2016, Russia was â€” for the first time officially â€” declared a direct threat to the allianceâ€™s security.The document has surfaced just as Russia and NATO states are in a row over what constitutes European security. In late December, Moscow shared its own security guarantee proposals with NATO and the United States, which specifically prioritize non-expansion of NATO eastwards and non-deployment of offensive weapons near the Russian borders, as well as shifting alliance forces in Eastern Europe to the positions of 1997.In 1997, Russia and NATO signed the Founding Act, under which the alliance pledged to â€œcarry out its collective defense and other missions by ensuring the necessary interoperability, integration, and capability for reinforcement rather than by additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces.â€ However, three former Warsaw pact members â€“ Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic â€“ joined NATO right away in 1999, followed by Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia, as well as Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Slovenia in 2004.Since the 1990s, that is after the end of the Cold War, NATOâ€™s expansion has been the largest to date, both in terms of the number of newly admitted members and in terms of the alliance's influence. Now, NATO is using the Ukrainian government's provocations and accusations of an allegedly looming â€œinvasionâ€ as a pretext to further boost its presence around Russia.

Authorities in the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic have discovered an explosive device under a bridge being used by buses evacuating civilians from the region to Russia, a source affiliated with the security services has told Sputnik.The device was said to be found outside the town of Malogvardeysk, on the route toward the Izvarino border post. This information is being verified.Earlier Saturday, authorities in Donetsk reported receiving anonymous warnings about the placement of explosives in buildings in the northern part of the city, including two hotels and four residential neighbourhoods.On Friday evening, a UAZ jeep belonging to Donetsk People's Militia chief Denis Sinenkov was blown up in a parking lot outside the building housing the self-proclaimed republic's government. Investigators believe it to have been a deliberate car bombing, with the explosion powerful enough to have been heard across the city.Lugansk and Donetsk security forces have repeatedly accused the Ukrainian intelligence services of the use of explosive devices and car bombs to target republican leaders and civilians. On Friday, several hours after the car bombing in Donetsk, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence accused Russian security forces of mining social infrastructure in the city of Donetsk to give Moscow ""grounds for accusing Ukraine of terrorist attacks."" The same day, Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council chief Oleksiy Danilov claimed that the Donetsk and Lugansk militias could blow up buses evacuating civilians to Russia. Ukrainian officials provided no evidence to back up these allegations.Also Friday, Joint Forces Ukraine commander Oleksandr Pavlyuk announced that ""not a single Ukrainian round fell on civilian infrastructure"" in the Donbass, and insisted that the Ukrainian army ""does not shoot at civilians.""Pavlyuk made the claim following reports by the Donetsk and Lugansk militias that Kiev forces had engaged in massive shelling of the breakaway territories, including using 120-mm mortars prohibited by the Minsk Agreements.Authorities in the Donbass breakaways declared a general military mobilization on Saturday amid the sharp increase in Ukrainian shelling, fearing that the attacks may be followed up by a full-scale invasion. A day earlier, the republics began a mass evacuation of civilians to Russia. Russian authorities have promised to provide evacuees with food, shelter and medical assistance.On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on Ukraine to sit down to the negotiating table with Donbass leaders as soon as possible to implement the Minsk Agreements. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile, expressed ""alarm"" over Kiev's escalation in the Donbass, and the use of arms banned by Minsk in the region.The European Union has already swallowed hundreds of billions of euros in losses in successive rounds of Western sanctions against Russia and Russian agricultural countersanctions over the crisis in Ukraine, which began in 2014. The EU's US allies, who encouraged Brussels to implement the anti-Russian restrictions, suffered much smaller losses, owing to the negligible scale of trade between the US and Russia to begin with.

""Ideally, an independent non-aligned Ukraine would provide stability and a buffer against war for both sides,"" Black said.Russia has been facing a wave of Western criticism in recent months over the build-up of troops along Ukrainian borders in alleged preparation of invasion. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed these allegations, pointing out NATO's increased activities near its own borders.Black underscored that Russia has legitimate concerns with the eastward expansion of NATO.Black went on to say that Europe is ""not enthusiastic about hostilities with Russia.""""Germany enjoys excellent relations with Russia and looks forward to opening the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would shield vital gas supplies from outside political interference,"" he explained.Black also noted that before the current tensions Germany saw no threat from Russia and practically eliminated its inventory of tanks.""Starting in 1965, Germany built 4,744 Leopard main battle tanks. But by 2020, Germany slashed its inventory to just 236 tanks,"" he said. ""That demilitarization wasnâ€™t because they relied on U.S. protection; it was because they assessed the probability of Russian invasion as zero.""Germany is not the only NATO member that is lukewarm about the war in Ukraine, Black continued to say.""French President Emmanuel Macron has tried to bridge differences between Russia and Ukraine,"" he said. ""Hungary values its good relations with Russia and is unlikely to support Ukraine in the event of hostilities, and Croatia announced it would recall its troops from NATO if war broke out. Europe seems less sanguine about war than either the US or UK.""""Russia would undoubtedly prefer to avoid military conflict,"" he said. ""Since Russia is torn between the desire for peace and the need for security, it is impossible to assess whether war will break out with Ukraine.""Black also stressed that it is most unfortunate that the United States and Western nations have poured advanced weapons into Ukraine.""These are offensive weapons like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles,"" he said. ""At some point, Russia may be forced to take military action against the dangerous military buildup on their border with Ukraine. Peace cannot be achieved by dumping arms and ammunition at Russiaâ€™s front door.""The former state senator said he found odd recent media reports - that cited US intelligence - suggesting that Russia would invade Ukraine on 16 February.""The specificity of that assertion was strange,"" Black said. ""Apparently, that date was specified by Ukrainian President Zelensky, a former comedian.""Black said after President Joe Biden alerted the entire leadership of the Western world about the date, Ukraine indicated that the claim was simply a joke and that Zelensky was just being ""ironic.""Nonetheless, the genuine risk of war is substantial and Russian concerns must be addressed sooner or later.Black pointed as the source of the problem, the 2014 Western-backed coup that ousted the legitimately-elected Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The revolutionaries installed a new government in Kiev at gunpoint, he said.Black went on to say they Russia did not initiate the hostile conditions in 2014, but the Russian Federation responded to dangerous events unleashed by the revolution in Kiev.However, Black went on to say, NATO needlessly advanced military forces eastward, ""provocatively encircling Russia in a manner that rendered it vulnerable to a surprise attack by NATO.""""The posting of NATO military advisers within Ukraine itself may now force Russia to advance militarily and divide Ukraine at the Dnieper River,"" he said.

""The FDFA recommends that people of Swiss nationality in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions leave these regions temporarily by their own means. Some airlines have reduced or suspended their flights to Ukraine,"" the foreign ministry said in a Saturday travel update.According to the FDFA, Switzerland is ready to support dialogue aimed at resolving the Ukraine conflict peacefully. The Donetsk and Lugansk self-proclaimed people's republics (DPR and LPR) have been reporting continued shelling of Donbass settlements by Kiev forces for the past several days. LPR and DPR announced the evacuation of their citizens to Russiaâ€™s Rostov Region on Friday.""Switzerland is concerned about the increase in armed hostilities observed by the OSCE [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe] Special Monitoring Mission in eastern Ukraine. We call on all sides to recommit to the ceasefire and actively contribute to de-escalation,"" the Swiss foreign ministry said on Twitter, adding that Switzerland is ready to support ""constructive dialogue.""Pierre-Alain Eltschinger, a spokesman for the Swiss foreign ministry, told Sputnik on Friday that Switzerland is ready to host a meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Earlier this week, Blinken proposed to Lavrov to hold another meeting next week.Western countries and Kiev have been accusing Russia of preparing for an alleged ""invasion"" of Ukraine. Moscow has denied these accusations, repeatedly stating that it is not threatening anyone and at the same time expressing strong concerns over NATO's military activity near the Russian borders, which it deems a threat to its national security. Russia has pointed out that rising fears of an ""invasion"" in Ukraine appear to be used as a pretext for advancing NATO's military presence further eastward in Europe.According to Lavrov, the ongoing turmoil is being deliberately promoted by the West to cover up Kievâ€™s sabotage of the Minsk agreements.

""At the end of the Cold War we disbanded our information unit, but the Russians didn't disband theirs, so we faced years and years of Russian disinformation,"" Truss claimed in an interview with The Mail on Sunday.She alleged that since the start of February, there have been ""40 pieces of Russian false information that have been put out"" and that she plans to establish a new Russia-Ukraine Government Information Cell (GIC) that will focus on exposing ""fake narratives.""In the past few months, Western countries and Kiev have been accusing Russia of preparing for an alleged ""invasion"" of Ukraine.

DPR and LPR have been reporting continuing shelling of Donbas settlements by Kiev forces, in violation of the Minsk peace deal.

Russia and Belarus will continue military drills due to the deterioration of the security situation in the Donbass, Belarusian Defence Minister Viktor Khrenin has announced.The defence minister specified that the drills will involve operational training issues not covered in the large-scale Russian-Belarusian Allied Resolve 2022 exercises being wrapped up, with their focus remaining unchanged - ensuring the capability to react adequately and deescalate any aggression by ill-wishers.Khrenin warned that the two countries' neighbours have been ""pumped up"" with modern weapons, and that a priority had been set for offensive arms, as well as the modernisation of military and transport infrastructure.""Numerous groupings of troops and forces have been created on the territory of neighbouring states, including in third countries. The level of readiness of joint force group NATO emergency response units has improved from seven to five days readiness time in case of a so-called 'escalation of the situation in Ukraine',"" he said.NATO, Khrenin indicated, has ""multiplied"" the number of exercises near the Union State several times over. ""Their orientation against Russia and the Republic of Belarus is also obvious,"" he said.""The idea of the inevitability of war with the 'eastern neighbour' has been firmly embedded in the consciousness of the Western man in the street. At the same time, Russia and Belarus are accused of militaristic aspirations. The West refuses to accept the 'red lines' outlined by Russia in the security architecture of Europe, with these red lines also relevant to Belarusians. We can see how the fundamental principle of the indivisibility of security is being rejected,"" the minister said.Instead, Khrenin suggested, the West is seeking to ""bypass"" these red lines, including with concepts about new formats for the military absorption of Ukrainian territory into the Western bloc.Russia and Belarus launched the large-scale Allied Resolve-2022 drills last week, with the exercises wrapping up on Sunday. The defensive drills included exercises simulating efforts to repel aggression against the Union State. The exercises involved tank manoeuvres, artillery and air defence drilling, training involving the redeployment of Russian aircraft to Belarus, and naval exercises involving Russian fleets. The exercises also included the simulated defence of Crimea.Donbass DeteriorationWestern officials and media have spent months accusing Russia of planning to ""invade Ukraine,"" even citing a firm 16 February deadline for the incursion to begin. 16 February came and went without incident, prompting the West to update the ""Russian invasion"" schedule to some time after 20 February.Instead of a Russian invasion, the past three days have witnessed a dramatic deterioration of the security situation in Donetsk and Lugansk - the self-proclaimed republics which broke off from Ukraine after a coup in Kiev in 2014. On Friday, amid escalating Ukrainian artillery and mortar shelling and sniper attacks, Donbass officials began an evacuation of the civilian population, and called up reserve forces amid fears that Kiev may begin an all-out offensive.As of Sunday, over 40,000 refugees have arrived in Rostov, the Russian region bordering the Donbass breakaways. Multiple civilian and military casualties have been reported to date amid back-and-forth fire across the line of contact, and Donetsk and Lugansk People's Militia units have reported repulsing Ukrainian offensive and sabotage operations.Ukraine has accused Russia of escalating Donbass tensions, while Kiev's Western backers have largely ignored the conflict in Donetsk and Lugansk. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on Ukrainian authorities to sit down to the negotiating table with Donetsk and Lugansk representatives as soon as possible to resolve the crisis.

""Russia does not pose a threat to the United States, does not threaten Ukraine. We do not seek to destabilise Washington or Kiev. Americans and Ukrainians are not our opponents,"" Antonov said, as quoted by the Russian embassy in the US on Facebook.Antonov said that US media ""replicate disinformation"" on Russia's alleged ""invasion"" of Ukraine.The ambassador stressed that the fact that Russia deploys its troops on its territory does not affect the interests of the US.""The deployment of the Russian Armed Forces on its national territory does not and cannot affect fundamental interests of the United States. I remind you that our forces are not present on the territory of Ukraine,"" Antonov said.The diplomat also said that Russia and the US have equal rights in terms of security, but NATO has come right to Russian borders.""It is impossible to invite Russia to cooperation on arms control and, at the same time, unlimitedly step up NATO's military potential at our borders,"" Antonov concluded.

US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed on the principle of a proposed summit to lay out issues related to strategic stability and security in Europe, according to a Sunday release by Ã‰lysÃ©e. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are slated to meet on Thursday, February 24, to begin the diplomatic effort. Biden has committed to work with all relevant stakeholders in preparation for the summit. The move came following French President Emmanuel Macron's brief chat with Biden, and a significantly longer call in which Macron spoke with Putin. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz were also phoned by their French counterpart. Commenting on the diplomatic pursuit, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki repeatedly stressed that the summit, as well as the Thursday Blinken-Lavrov meeting, will only proceed if no invasion occurs. As Blinken meets with Lavrov later this week, Biden will conduct a same-day, virtual meeting with G7 leaders in preparation for the summit, according to the Whtie House. This diplomatic development follows a CBS broadcast in which Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov pointed out that Russian troops are on sovereign territory and ""are not threatening anyone."" He also highlighted that the Kremlin ""publicly expressed readiness to continue diplomatic efforts"" regarding the situation.

""If Kiev and Donbass [Ukraineâ€™s southeast] agree to convene a meeting of the CG [contact group], Russia, of course, will also participate in it,"" the source said, adding that ""the functions of a mediator oblige this.""On Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron held telephone talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, at the French side's initiative. The presidents agreed on trilateral contact group (Russia, Ukraine, OSCE - Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) talks on Ukraine to be held on Monday, according to media reports.The Elysee Palace said that Macron has proposed that Putin and US President Joe Biden hold a joint summit, and both sides have accepted the idea in principle. According to the French presidency, the agenda of the summit is to be prepared by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during their upcoming meeting on 24 February. The White House said that Biden had agreed to the idea of meeting with Putin, provided that there is no ""invasion"" of Ukraine.Moscow has repeatedly denied Western claims of Russiaâ€™s alleged preparations for an ""invasion"" of Ukraine, emphasizing that it is not threatening anyone and at the same time expressing strong concerns over NATO's military activity near the Russian borders. The LPR and DPR announced the evacuation of their citizens to Russiaâ€™s Rostov Region on Friday amid fears of an attack by Ukrainian forces. DPR head Denis Pushilin said on Friday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would soon order an offensive against Donbass.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is hoping Russia will recognise the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, since this would enable him to avoid implementing the political portion of the Minsk Agreements, Strana.ua reports, citing sources close to the Ukrainian presidential administration.Kiev has no plans for direct negotiations with the Donbass breakaway regions, and seeks to avoid making changes to Ukraine's Constitution to provide them with a special autonomous status, as required by the Minsk deal, sources say.According to the outlet, Kiev is looking to take advantage of the dramatic escalation in the Donbass area seen in recent days to avoid fulfilling promises recently made to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to move forward with Minsk II.The outlet's sources also confirmed that neither Zelensky nor those close to him seriously believe in the threat of a Russian ""invasion"" of Ukraine, despite months of claims by Western officials and media citing an ""imminent"" Russian incursion.In an interview with RBK Ukraina last week, Zelensky confirmed that the German chancellor and French President Emmanuel Macron had insisted on the Minsk Agreements' implementation. Zelensky characterised the peace deal as ""botched"" and complained that ""it is designed in such a way as to make us weaker from the start, to be in a losing position"".Publicly, however, Zelensky appeared to have assured Scholz and Macron of Kiev's preparedness to continue working on the Minsk Agreements, something mentioned publicly by Macron and recently by Scholz in his talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Moscow.""President Zelensky said firmly yesterday that the Trilateral Contact Group, within which the Minsk process is taking placeâ€¦will soon be presented with all three texts of the envisaged bills â€“ on the status of Ukraine, amendments to the constitution, and preparations for elections. This is good progress to build on"", Scholz told reporters last Tuesday following his talks with the Russian president.Two days later, the self-proclaimed Donbass republics reported a dramatic escalation of shelling, mortar attacks, and sniper fire by Ukrainian forces, culminating in the decision by republican leaders Friday to announce a general mobilisation and to begin the evacuation of their civilian populations to Russia.President Putin reiterated Russia's position on the conflict in eastern Ukraine on Friday. ""The guarantee to restoring peace in Ukraine and relieving tension around this country lies in the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. All Kiev needs to do is sit down at the negotiating table with representatives of the Donbass and agree on political, military, economic and humanitarian measures to end this conflict. The sooner this happens, the better"", Putin said.Also last week, the Russian Duma approved an appeal to the president asking him to grant Russian recognition to the self-proclaimed Donbass republics. DPR and LPR heads Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik welcomed the move. In his talks with Scholz, Putin stressed that the potential of the Minsk Agreements has not yet been exhausted.Minsk II was signed in the Belarusian capital on 12 February 2015, after months of heavy fighting between Ukrainian troops and separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. The civil conflict in Ukraine began in the spring of 2014, when the Ukrainian government sent troops to crush nascent independence movements which sprang up in the aftermath of a US and EU-backed coup d'Ã©tat in Kiev in February of that year. The subsequent Ukrainian crisis resulted in the most serious deterioration of relations between the West and Russia since the Cold War.

""The fact of all facts is that whenever a war starts, the first victim is the truth,"" says Professor Stevan Gajic, a research associate at the Institute of European Studies in Belgrade. ""I believe that this is exactly the case this time as well. We had these announcements that the invasion will start on 16 February or before, and none of the claims were backed by solid evidence. We have not seen anything so far. I only see these claims as a part of a propaganda war that we're witnessing now.""The claims were made by Ambassador Bathsheba Nell Crocker, the US representative to the Office of the United Nations, in her letter to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet. Her letter, obtained by NBC News, says that the US has ""credible information that indicates Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation."" Crocker went on to claim that ""Russian forces will likely use lethal measures to disperse peaceful protests or otherwise counter peaceful exercises of perceived resistance from civilian populations."" The Kremlin dismissed Crocker's allegations as ""fiction.""According to Gajic, the main motivation behind Washington's new narrative is to create a state of panic among Ukrainians. The question is whether the Americans and other nations believe the US State Department after it repeatedly discredited itself, says the professor.The White House's manipulation of facts including the whitewashing of atrocities committed by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and hysteria over the alleged weapons of mass distraction (WMD) in Iraq, led to ""unmeasurable suffering of millions of people and the onslaught of the situation until the present day,"" warns Gajic.Time and time again, the West has resorted to a ""selective worldview,"" the academic stresses. This time it's accusing Russia of ""would-be"" violations of human rights in Ukraine while neglecting Kiev's violations of the ceasefire and safety of the citizens of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, according to Gajic. Prior to that, the US and the EU turned a blind eye to the violations of the Russian speaking population in the Baltic states, Serbia's legitimate claim to Kosovo, and the fact that NATO bombed Yugoslavia in 1999 without the UN resolution or Security Council's decision, he notes.According to the academic, the Donbass issue has been overlooked and neglected by the West since the 2014 Ukrainian coup, while the Kiev regime's opponents have been suppressed and silenced.Meanwhile, between August and October 2021, in the village of Slavyanoserbsk, in the area of the residential area Sokogorovka Pervomaisk, the village of Vidnoye-1 near Lugansk and on the outskirts of the village of Verkhneshevyrevka, Krasnodonsky district, five mass graves were discovered, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia. The remains of at least 295 civilians, including women, who were killed by indiscriminate shelling by Ukrainian armed forces in 2014, were exhumed. The conflict in Eastern Ukraine has claimed the lives of over 13,000 people since 2014, according to the UN. The attacks on the peaceful civilians of Donbass by the Kiev and neo-Nazi militias were called nothing short of genocide by Russian President Vladimir Putin.However, White House Spokeswoman Jens Psaki rushed to cast doubt on the mass graves disclosure. For his part, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz claimed at the annual Munich Security Conference on 19 February that it is ""really ridiculous"" to say that ""there is something like genocide"" in Donbass.On 18 February, the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics announced the evacuation of their citizens to Russia amid an escalation on the contact line between Ukraine and the DPR and LPR, as Kiev forces intensified shelling of the Donbass region. According to the DPR, Kiev forces fired 12 122-mm calibre mortars at Zaichenko, Donetsk region, on Monday.

New sanctions against Russia could backfire and impact Germanyâ€™s own economy, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck has warned.The vice chancellor indicated that German companies have been made to understand the risks. He warned that Germany may be on the verge of a war the likes of which has not been seen for decades, and the consequences of which could be unpredictable.Russia and Germany are among one anotherâ€™s largest trade partners, with Russia gas accounting for up to 40 percent of German consumption, and Germany providing the Russian side with a broad range of industrial goods and automobiles.Committee chairman Oliver Hermes said that everyone benefits from â€œclose business and export ties with our eastern European Union neighbours as well as important partner nations such as Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.â€ He warned that it was â€œtotally irresponsibleâ€ for â€œthe fruits of this workâ€ to be â€œagain endangered by unresolved political conflicts.â€Germany has joined with allies in threatening to impose crushing new sanctions against Russia in the event of an escalation in Ukraine. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned that Germany would be willing to â€œpay a high economic priceâ€ to â€œpunishâ€ Russia if it attacked its neighbour.â€œThatâ€™s why all options are on the table for me, also Nord Stream 2,â€ Baerbock said.The foreign minister warned that the West was united and ready to use â€œunprecedented sanctionsâ€ pressure against Moscow. â€œWe show solidarity because we are committed to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, and Iâ€™m being very clear here,â€ she said.Baerbock when on to suggest that Berlin â€œdoesnâ€™t wantâ€ to threaten Russia with crushing financial, political and economic penalties, but would to prefer â€œto have a serious security dialogue on security and peace together in Europeâ€ with Moscow.Habeck and Baerbock are members of the Green Party â€“ which joined the German Social Democratic Party and the Free Democrats in a coalition government following elections last year. While in opposition, the Greens consistently attacked Nord Stream 2, and called on the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel to import more gas supplies from the US and other countries instead. The Greens are also supportive of NATOâ€™s eastward push, and opposed to closer economic cooperation between Europe and China.The US and its European allies have spent months accusing Russia of preparing to â€œinvade Ukraineâ€ and threatening to impose apocalyptic sanctions ranging from restrictions on doing business with Russian banks to personal sanctions on individuals connected to the Russian government or state industries, to threats to cut Russia off from the SWIFT interbank transfer system and starve Moscow of technology and industrial imports. Russian officials have expressed readiness to address any potential sanctions pressure and the economic consequences restrictions cause.

The order also places economic penalties on individuals who breach Section 1 of the order, stating that they will be ""blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in"". It also bars immigration and non-immigration entry into the United States of anyone found to have violated the order. The order is predominantly an expansion of a series of four executive orders (Executive Order 13660, Executive Order 13661, Executive order 13662, Executive Order 13685) signed by then-US President Barrack Obama in 2014, following the start of the conflict in Donbass in eastern Ukraine, and an executive order from 2018 (Executive Order 13849) signed by then-President Donald Trump. The Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic were recognised by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday after declaring their independence from Ukraine in 2014. The two regions are predominantly Russian-speaking, and ethnic Russians are a sizeable minority throughout the region. Russia is the first member of the United Nations to recognise the sovereignty of the two regions. The Biden administration's executive order casts doubt that other nations will follow Russia's lead. Analysts believe that Russia's formal recognition of the two regions could see tensions between the United States, Ukraine, and Russia increase. The US and its NATO allies and Ukraine have for weeks been accusing Russia of preparing an invasion of Ukraine. Russia has sent troops into the regions to help maintain peace in the regions, an order by the Russian president that was part of the earlier signed agreement with regional leadership.

Global oil prices have continued to grow due to the escalation of tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, with the price of Brent crude topping $99 per barrel for the first time since September 2014.As of 08:36 GMT, the price of April futures for Brent crude was up 4.05 percent, while April futures for West Texas Intermediate were trading up 4.66 percent at $94.44 per barrel.The development comes amid growing tensions between Russian and the West over Ukraine. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of of the Donetsk People's Republic (LPR) and the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR), a move that caused condemnation from the United States and Ukrainian authorities.Russia's decision to recognise DPR and LPR followed requests by the leaders of the breakaway republics, who accused Ukraine of attacking their territories, thereby forcing DPR and LPR to begin the evacuation of civilians (women and children) to Russia. Kiev, for its part, has claimed that it was not responsible for the attacks.President Putin said that Moscow would send Russian troops on a peacekeeping mission to the two republics. The US envoy to the United Nations described the statement as ""nonsense"", while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kiev was not afraid of the move. ""We are on our own land. We owe nothing to anyone. And we will not give anything to anyone"", he said.Oil prices have been growing for several months amid statements by the US and its allies about Russia planning an ""invasion"" of Ukraine, a claim the Kremlin has rejected as absurd and false.Maike Currie, an investment director at Fidelity International, said oil could go above $100 per barrel due to a combination of factors â€“ the ongoing standoff over Ukraine, cold winter in the United States, as well as a lack of investment in oil and gas supplies around the world.Market experts fear that the ongoing standoff may trigger disruptions to oil supply. Potential sanctions imposed on Russia is another factor leading to increased prices. The United Kingdom pledged to introduce a ""significant package of sanctions"" in response to Russia's decision to recognise LPR and DPR. The United States too has announced such a move.The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc will discuss punitive measures against Russia during a meeting of foreign ministers on Tuesday.

This was made necessary because of the mounting offensive coming from the NATO-backed Kiev regime. Since last week, thousands of mortars and shells have hit the self-declared Donbass republics, fired by the US and NATO-backed Ukrainian forces. Many of these forces are open supporters of Neo-Nazi beliefs that view the ethnic Russian people in Donbass as â€œUntermenschenâ€. If you donâ€™t know that already, you have been reading too much Western media disinformation.Moscow had stuck with a political process for nearly seven years to give peace in Ukraine a chance. The so-called Minsk agreement was never implemented by the Kiev regime despite it being a signatory to an international, legally binding accord. The Donetsk and Lugansk breakaway regions were not given the autonomy that the 2015 Minsk deal mandated. Instead, the populations in those regions have been under relentless siege for all these years from the Kiev regime.The denial of political and human rights to Donbass, such as the entitled use of the Russian language, by Kiev and its ongoing military hostility, amounted to a campaign of genocide. Emboldened by US and NATO weaponry flooding in as well as by European blindness to violations of the Minsk agreements, the Kiev regime had openly repudiated any peace process.It was evident that the escalating violence against the people of the Donbass was leading to a blood bath. Up to 50,000 civilians have fled the region across the Russian border in the last week. A state of emergency was declared in both the Donetsk and Lugansk Peopleâ€™s Republics owing to the extreme hostility and duress from power being cut off by acts of terrorism. Acts of terrorism that were being sponsored by US and NATO support no less. The Western media silence on these crimes is a source of shame if not complicity.Itâ€™s easy to be cynical on the basis of misinformation and ignorance. Western governments and media are now condemning Russiaâ€™s President Vladimir Putin for recognizing the independence of the Donbass republics. New rounds of Western sanctions on Russia are forthcoming. The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany is now suspended.Moscow is accused of using â€œrecognitionâ€ and sending in â€œpeacekeeping Russian troopsâ€ as a backdoor for invasion. For months, the United States and its allies have been alleging Russia was planning to â€œimminently invadeâ€ Ukraine. Moscow had always refuted the claims as hysterical nonsense.Now it seems the West can make out that their claims about Russian invasion plans are being proven â€“ albeit under the guise of Moscow recognizing what was formerly Ukrainian territory as â€œindependent republicsâ€.That view is made possible by being in a state of ignorance about the reality of conflict in Ukraine and the dire humanitarian conditions in Donbass. Western media never reported on the situation with any objectivity or fair concern. It had continually maintained the distorted propaganda narrative that Russia was â€œsupporting a bloody rebellionâ€ in Donbass as a proxy war against Ukraine.The truth is the Kiev regime came to power through an illegal coup dâ€™Ã©tat in 2014 covertly supported by the CIA and NATO powers. The new regime was (and still is) dominated by Neo-Nazi factions who immediately turned to aggression against the Russian populations of Crimea and Donbass. Fortunately, Crimea was able to escape through a referendum in 2014 and join the Russian Federation which affords national security. In Western media that is portrayed as 'Russiaâ€™s illegal annexation of Crimea'.The Donbass had to endure nearly eight years of aggression and siege tantamount to genocide. With mounting offensiveness by the Kiev regime in recent days and outright repudiation of the Minsk peace accord, Russia had no choice but to move to defend the Russian people of Donbass.This will be twisted and vilified by Western media as a â€œRussian invasionâ€ and undermining Ukraineâ€™s sovereignty and territorial integrity. But such distortion is only superficially tenable due to the ignorance or indifference of Western media about the reality of what has been happening in Ukraine over the past eight years and in particular in the Donbass.Supposedly righteous Western governments and media have been supporting a regime whose forces are armed and trained by the United States and NATO to carry out a genocidal war against the Russian people of Donbass. That outrage had to be stopped. Moscowâ€™s brave decision this week to recognize the Donbass republics was a necessity to stop the violence.With the Donetsk and Lugansk Peopleâ€™s Republics now having the support of Russia and its military, the Kiev regime and its NATO sponsors will have been given serious pause in their nefarious scheme. It didnâ€™t have to be this way if the US and its European allies had not interfered in Ukraine and emboldened a Russophobic regime to wage a civil war. But since that had happened, and a peace accord was being trashed, the next best thing to do was to move to protect Russian people. Bravo Russia. The howls of condemnation we hear in the West is the cacophony of fools who are impotent anyway.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration believes Russia may engage in a full invasion in Ukraine before the night is over.



""I do, unfortunately Russia has positioned its forces at the final point of readiness across Ukraine's borders, to the North, to the East, to the South, everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken told NBC News on Wednesday when asked if he believes Russian forces will be engaged in something akin to a full invasion of Ukraine.

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said that ""transposing"" the tensions between Russia and Ukraine in the Donbass region to a potential escalation of hostilities over Taiwan ""makes me uncomfortable"".""As a country in the Indo-Pacific, for us, the problems in the Indo-Pacific are quite unique"", added Jaishankar, formerly an Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer.India's chief diplomat was on an official three-day visit to France between 20 and 23 February. He arrived in Paris from Germany, where he attended the Munich Security Conference. During both legs of his two-nation visit, Jaishankar has been asked about New Delhi's position on the current situation in Ukraine.""I completely get it that the world is globalised and that there are common patterns"", he further remarked.The Indian foreign minister, however, added that those involved in ""policy formulations"" needed to be specific about issues.Jaishankar remarked that history over the last 75 years had ""taken a very different turn"" in Europe than in the Asia-Pacific region.He underlined that the reunification of Germany in 1990 and the end of the Cold War heralded the beginning of the ""expansion"" of the European project (the European Union was formed in 1993).""In the case of Ukraine, a lot of it derives from post-Soviet politics, the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the dynamics between Russia and Europe and Russia and the West"", stated the Indian delegate.Jaishankar added that in the case of Asia, the emergence of the region was largely a ""product of the autonomous"" economic growth of Japan and other East Asian countries, as well as China and India later.China has also rejected any ""parallels"" whatsoever between Ukraine and Taiwan, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin reiterating at a press briefing on Tuesday that ""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory"".India Calls For 'Utmost Restraint'The remarks by the Indian foreign minister come two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin moved to recognise the primarily Russian-speaking Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics as independent states. Both of the former Ukrainian regions had declared independence from Kiev in 2014.Putin argued in a televised address that the Minsk Protocol, which sought to end the hostilities in the area, among the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine (comprised of Russia, Ukraine, and the OSCE) had been ""killed"" by Kiev. The Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics had earlier started evacuating civilians, reporting constant shelling by Ukrainian forces.Meanwhile, the US has claimed that Putin's decision to recognise the two states is tantamount to an ""invasion"", as Washington and its NATO allies such as Great Britain mount sanctions against Russian financial institutions, individuals, as well as ""prohibiting"" investments in the Donbass republics. Germany, for its part, has put on hold the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would bring gas from Russia to Europe.India has said that escalating tensions along the Ukraine-Russia border ""undermine"" peace and security in the region, urging a diplomatic path ending the crisis.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated on Wednesday that UN chief Antonio Guterres ""turned out to be subject to pressure from the West and recently made several statements about what is happening in eastern Ukraine that are at odds with his status and his powers under the UN Charter"".The diplomat told UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen during their meeting in Moscow that the secretary general has never spoken up in support of the Minsk agreements. The Russian minister highlighted that the UN secretariat should advocate impartiality in any crisis, including the Ukrainian issue.Lavrov noted that Russia has already briefed Guterres on Moscow's assessment of his statements through the Russian permanent representative to the United Nations in New York, Vasily Nebenzya. The Russian minister also asked Pedersen to convey the Russian assessment to the secretary general personally.The statement came as Guterres claimed that the Russian troops deployed to Donbass would not be ""peacekeepers"" and said that Ukraine's attacks against people in the republics are not considered to be genocide.The situation in Donbass has been deteriorating over the past few days, with attacks by Ukrainian forces causing mass evacuations in the DPR and LPR. In a bid to stop the conflict, Russia recognised both republics in the Donbass region as independent states and urged Ukraine to stop the escalation there.Addressing the situation in the region, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the events taking place in the Donbass are genocide, noting that Kiev violates human rights, including by legalising the discrimination of the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine. He stressed that the civilian population of Donbass is a target of everyday shelling by the Ukrainian military and a vicious blockade by Kiev.Russia has also repeatedly slammed Kiev's for not implementing the Minsk agreements. In one of the latest instances, Ukrainian authorities decided to introduce a bill in parliament that would deny amnesty to those who had fought for the Donbass republics once the conflict is over. This is clearly at odds with the Minsk agreements, which clearly state that such amnesty must be provided for all people living in the areas once peace is achieved.

To a large extent, this is due to Russia's sense of insecurity triggered by the aftermath of the 2014 Colour Revolution in Ukraine instigated by the US. NATO's eastward expansion has intensified internal conflicts in Ukraine and between the country and Russia, leading to a complicated situation.The US Democratic administration has been deeply involved in the situation in Ukraine.President Joe Biden, acting as Vice President in 2014, also played a role in the colour revolution along with almost all of the current US diplomats and security officials. The situation in 2022 is a natural extension of the 2014 Color Revolution, the consequences of which can't be quelled in a matter of months.The US is actually playing a ""Europe card,"" taking the EU ""hostage"" and forcing it to stay in the transatlantic alliance. The leaders of the European major powers have to come forward to reach an understanding with Russia. Otherwise, Russia and Europe will suffer the loss.China is an outsider. It respects the complex history of the region and hopes the situation does not develop into an intense US-led geopolitical conflict and catastrophe.China will support Russia's economic fundamentals from the impact of potential Western sanctions. In addition, China will keep calling for a resolution of the crisis through diplomatic channels as China has always done. This has nothing to do with the Wall Street Journal's allegation that China aims to ""protect ties with the US"".Europe has been in constant strife over territorial and ethnic issues for centuries, a situation that is unique and has not ceased even after the Cold War. First, the former Yugoslavia was dismembered by the US-led NATO, and now the US is using the Ukraine crisis to undermine Russia's security. Those are all problems they need to solve themselves.US politicians and media have recently been sowing discord between China and Russia. A Foreign Affairs article claimed China is a player which ""stands awkwardly"". China, on one hand, ""has taken Russia's side, blaming NATO expansion for causing the crisis"", and on the other hand, has called for diplomacy over war in order to ""prevent relations with the US from significantly deteriorating"". The US always desires an alienated partnership between China and Russia. In fact, Chinese and Russian leaders are clearly aware of the two countries' own problems. China has never and will never get involved in Russia's historical problems including its relations with the countries that became independent after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The Ukraine crisis is extremely complex, and this issue needs to be solved on the basis of understanding history and reality simultaneously. If the history of the region is ignored, there can be no correct path to a solution. The US is playing a big game at minimal cost, trying to keep Europe in trepidation to maintain the transatlantic alliance and its arms sales. Lockheed Martin, one of the largest American companies in military support, became the world's largest defence contractor by revenue for the fiscal year 2014, thanks to the tense situations in Ukraine. The US has complained for years about the levels of Europe's defence spending because of the huge influence of US defence contractors on the government.Arguably, the US needs to take the greatest responsibility for the current tensions, and it will not be restrained unless it suffers losses to its own economy.This article was originally published by the Global Times.

In a radio interview on Tuesday, former US President Donald Trump predicted that following Russiaâ€™s Monday recognition of the Donetsk and Lugansk Peopleâ€™s Republics, which the US has characterized as a land grab, Chinese President Xi Jinping will attempt to make a move on Taiwan.He made the comments Tuesday on â€œThe Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show,â€ where he told the hosts â€œthis would never have happened if we were there.â€â€œYou think theyâ€™re gonna go after Taiwan?â€ Clay asked him.â€œBut you think with Biden theyâ€™ll try him?â€ Clay then asked.Speaking on Tuesday, Biden claimed Putinâ€™s recognition of the Donbass republics and sending of peacekeepers to the region was â€œthe beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.â€ He used the development to claim that months of vague warnings about an invasion were true, and to justify issuing economic sanctions targeting Russian financial institutions.By contrast, Taiwan is a territory controlled by the former Chinese government that Beijing has always maintained is an integral part of China. In 1949, the communist Red Army triumphed in the civil war, conquering the entire mainland and establishing the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in Beijing; but the old Republic of China government survived on Taiwan, where the Red Army could not invade, and has persisted ever since. All but a handful of small nations have switched their recognition of the Chinese government from Taipei to Beijing, including the US in 1979, but Washington has continued to funnel weapons and other support to Taiwan in an open but informal fashion.China has condemned US support for Taiwan, calling it a violation of the three joint communiques underpinning the US-China diplomatic relationship and an intervention in internal Chinese affairs.Xi went on to say that he anticipates such a reunion would happen under the framework of â€œone country, two systems,â€ used to incorporate the former British colony of Hong Kong into China as a special autonomous region.Similar to Russia vis-a-vis Ukraine, the US has accused China of threatening an invasion of Taiwan because of regular flights of Chinese aircraft through Taiwanâ€™s expansive and self-declared air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and Chinese naval drills in the seas surrounding Taiwan.On Tuesday, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar objected to similar comparisons between Ukraine and Taiwan, saying that problems in the Indo-Pacific region are â€œquite unique.â€""Both are products of very complex histories of that particular region. In the case of Ukraine, a lot of it derives from post-Soviet politics, the expansion of NATO, the dynamics between Russia and Europe, and Russia and the West broadly,"" the Indian minister said.New Delhi is locked in its own territorial dispute with Islamabad over the Kashmir region, which the two sides have roughly split in half but all of which is claimed by both sides. There are regular ceasefire violations along the fortified Line of Control that several times have flared up into full-blown wars between the two nuclear powers.

Forty-one Ukrainian military vehicles, 18 tanks and armoured fighting vehicles, 7 multiple rocket systems, and 5 combat boats have been destroyed by Russian forces, the country's Ministry of Defence said on FridayEarlier on Friday, a spokesman for the Russian military, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said Russian paratroopers had taken control of the area of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which is located around 100 kilometres from the Ukrainian capital Kiev.The Ministry of Defence also reported that the 36th brigade of Ukrainian forces has surrendered as well as 82 servicemen on Snake Island, in the Black Sea.The news comes amid a special operation conducted by Russia in Ukraine. It was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. The Russian head of state said he made the decision after the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, two breakaway regions that announced their independence from Ukraine in 2014, asked Moscow for help. Earlier this month, the LPR and DPR said that Kiev had shelled their territories, prompting the republics to order the evacuation of the civilian population to Russia.On 21 February, President Putin recognised the independence of the LPR and DPR, and in a televised address to the Russian population on Thursday, he announced a special operation aimed at protecting the residents of the two republics from the genocide being waged on them by the Ukrainian authorities.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described Russia's special operation as a ""full-scale invasion"" of Ukraine. In a televised address to the nation, he said 137 servicemen had been killed, while 316 were injured. Thirteen border guards were killed on Snake Island (also known as Serpent Island), the Ukrainian head of state said.He also stated that Russian forces had conducted strikes on civilian objects, including in residential areas of the capital Kiev. The Russian Defence Ministry stated that it is only conducting strikes on military infrastructure and that there is no threat to civilians. The ministry has not released any information on casualties or injured servicemen.Moscow's actions have been condemned by several countries, including Australia, Britain Canada, the Czech Republic, Japan, members of the European Union, and the United States. Western nations have since imposed harsh sanctions on Moscow targeting its banks, businesses, government officials, as well as individuals close to President Vladimir Putin. Reports say the European Union may introduce punitive measures against the president himself.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called Russia's actions wrong and called on President Putin to stop the special operation. Protests against the military operation in Ukraine were held in 44 Russian cities, including the capital Moscow.

""The escalation of the Ukraine crisis into an armed conflict has created an upheaval in crude oil and gas prices"", says Dr Mamdouh G. Salameh, an international oil economist and visiting professor of energy economics at the ESCP Europe Business School in London. ""However, if US and EU sanctions include sanctioning Russian gas and oil exports, this could cause gas and crude oil prices to rise much further"".The European Council on 24 February stated it had agreed on a new batch of sanctions targeting key Russian economic sectors in response to Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine. According to the EU body, ""these sanctions cover the financial sector, the energy and transport sectors, dual-use goods, as well as export control and export financing, visa policy, additional listings of Russian individuals, and new listing criteria"".In particular, the export ban imposed on Moscow by the EU will hamper Russia's oil refining and sales, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They will ""hit the oil sector by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries"", von der Leyen announced on Thursday.On 24 February, the price of March futures for gas in Europe skyrocketed to over $1,636 per 1,000 cubic metres, up 60% from Wednesday's indices. Brent crude spiked to over $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014.Earlier this week, Berlin froze the certification of Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline running under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, over recognition of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics by Moscow on 21 February. According to Salameh, it was nothing but a cosmetic move ""since the Russian pipeline has been sitting idle waiting for certification since its completion in September 2021"". Moreover, Scholz's decision doesn't mean stopping Nord Stream 2 altogether, the energy expert stresses. On the one hand, by killing the pipe Scholz would sink European energy giants who invested a lot in the project, on the other hand, Germany is dependent on Russian oil and gas for 65% of its needs, according to Salameh.Nord Stream 2 is designed to deliver 55 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas per year to Europe, thus doubling the original Nord Stream capacity to a total of 110 bcm. The pipeline cost â‚¬9.5 billion ($10.6 billion) to build, with roughly half of this sum being financed by a European consortium of companies, including OMV (Austria), Wintershall Dea (Germany), Engie (France), Uniper (Germany), and Shell (UK).For its part, Washington on 23 February introduced sanctions against Nord Stream AG, the company in charge of building the pipeline. Starting with Barack Obama, successive US administrations have sought to axe the project and expel Russia from the European energy market. The US urged the EU to switch to American liquefied natural gas (LNG).Yet, the combined LNG exports of the United States, Qatar, and Australia cannot replace Russian piped gas supplies (200 billion cubic metres [bcm] and 15-16 million tonnes [mt]) stresses Salameh, adding that the EU doesn't have enough LNG import capacity infrastructure to replace Russia's gas market share - which makes up more than 40 percent of the European gas market.'Suicide by Cop'If Europe moves to abandon Russia's energy imports it would be nothing short of what Americans call ""suicide by cop"", notes Tom Luongo, a geopolitical analyst and publisher of the Gold Goats 'n Guns Newsletter: ""That's where someone wants to die and picks a fight with a policeman in order to get the cop to shoot him"".In mid-December, Russia handed over its draft security proposals to the US and NATO to ensure European security and stability. On 26 January 2022, Russia received written responses to its proposals from Washington and the alliance. Both the US and NATO disregarded Moscow's core demands about the alliance's non-expansion, Ukraine's non admission to the bloc, non-deployment of offensive weapons systems near Russia's borders, and the return of the bloc's European capabilities and infrastructure to 1997 levels.In addition, Moscow asked individual European nations for views on the continent's security. The EU foreign security chief, Josep Borrell, responded on behalf of the 27 EU member states. According to Bloomberg, Borrell's response was coordinated with NATO and repeated major points outlined by the North Atlantic Alliance's letter to Moscow.Russia's repeated pleas to the EU to persuade the Ukrainian leadership to adhere to the Minsk Protocol approved by the UN Security Council in 2015 had also borne no fruit, as Kiev refused to hold direct talks with the DPR and LPR, which was a crucial provision of the Minsk deal. Instead, NATO, the US, the UK, and some EU members provided considerable amounts of weapons and sent military advisers to Kiev amid the Ukrainian government's military buildup along the contact line with Donbass and intensification of shelling against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics in further defiance of the Minsk agreements.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Friday that Canada would impose sanctions on Putin and other senior officials, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.Stepanov stressed that â€œthe decision of Trudeau's Cabinet is totally unacceptableâ€ as â€œIt contradicts all principles of interstate relations and diplomatic ethics.â€He noted that â€œall this suggests that the collective West essentially follows the policy of Hitler's Germany, for which the Russians and the people of Ukraine, who did not recognize the Nazi oppression during the World War II, were sub-humans.â€â€œThe current period will later be written in the black book of Canadian history,â€ the Ambassador added. â€œThis is a complete disrespect for the history of their country and the generation of Canadians who contributed to the victory over Nazism. But now their grandchildren are turning themselves into agents of the evil against which their grandfathers fought.â€â€œIf you look at it from a practical point of view, this unprecedented step indicates that Canada and its Western allies are deliberately bringing themselves to the threshold of breaking off all relations with Russia crossing which is difficult to imagine a civilized return to normality,â€ he said.Stepanov also said that there will be retaliatory measures, but they will be taken in Moscow.â€œIn the complex of what happened today, in the complex of all things,â€ the Ambassador added. â€œThe Foreign Ministry has already said that we've reached the point of no return. It looks like it. This is unprecedented.â€On Thursday, Russia began a special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only and the civilian population is not in danger. Moscow says it has no plans to occupy Ukraine.

Dr. Zorawar Daulet Singh, a Delhi-based historian, strategist, and author of a recently released book 'Powershift: Indiaâ€“China Relations in a multi-polar World' has deliberated about NATO's future and the ripple effect of the Russia-NATO row over the Indo-Pacific while talking to Sputnik during an interview.Sputnik: In a broader context, how do you assess the developments in Ukraine, which Russia says is an attempt to prevent a global war?Dr. Zorawar Daulet Singh: This point has been raised by President [Vladimir] Putin on several occasions recently, when he said the possibility of a major confrontation between Russia and US-NATO would have taken on a very different meaning had Ukraine already been a member state of NATO. Putin even raised the spectre of a nuclear crisis in the hypothetical scenario of Ukraine inside NATO's tent.Therefore, Russia is seeking to neutralise Ukraine's geopolitical status to solve the dangerous security crisis in Europe. This worrying development since 2014 led to a counter-reaction by Russia. Firstly, that counter-reaction led to the integration of Crimea after the referendum of its predominantly ethnic Russian population to join mainland Russia. What Russia has now done through its ongoing military operations is it has preempted the very possibility of Ukraine ever becoming a member state of NATO - by not only carving out territories that will now become independent states but also by positioning formidable military capabilities on Ukraineâ€™s frontiers that can impose extraordinary pressure on the US-NATO should they choose to subsequently respond to this particular military operation in a way that attempts to resuscitate the rump state in Kiev. In the next few weeks, if not days, the ball will eventually go back into the US court, and Washington will need to make a call on what to do. Are they going to negotiate with Russia for a new security order, or will they continue the old game of Russian containment? The latter has proven to be a self-defeating policy because it only produced insecurity in the European continent and also led to an erosion of US hegemony in the international system. The past decade makes it clear.If the US cuts its losses and stabilises the great power competition with Russia, I think everyone will be better-off: in Europe, Washington, Moscow and elsewhere in the world.Sputnik: The US and its allies like Japan and Australia have imposed sanctions targeting the military and economic sectors. Do you think sanctions are the correct way to deal with the crisis, as Russia has faced multiple sanctions in the past too?Dr. Zorawar Daulet Singh: Unilateral sanctions are not seen as legitimate by most non-Western states. We often hear the argument that imposing economic costs on Russia will persuade it to take a different course. Yet, what we have seen is that the containment of Russia, including economic containment, has actually been going on for a lot longer and far before this crisis in Eastern Europe had started playing out.From Russian perspective, the Western policy is not actually aimed at changing Russian behaviour in a particular case but it's part of a more radical containment geo-strategy to keep Russia weak, isolated, and separate from its traditional economic partners in Western Europe like Germany and France. For example, in the case of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia with Germany, there have been recurring attempts much before the Ukraine crisis to try and block out Russian gas to Germany and replace that with US LNG exports to Europe. On the whole, since 2014-2015, Russian policymakers have come to accept that economic sanctions are an acceptable cost to bear when it comes to core security and geopolitical interests. I think they are going to ride it out and they have ridden it out.Indeed, sections of the Russian elite see sanctions as an opportunity to reorient the Russian economy towards more domestic innovation and rebuilding parts of the industrial economy that has enormous potential given Russia's human capital in science and technology. Over time, sanctions could actually have the opposite effect. It leads to a stronger Russia that is more self-reliant, and we hear that specific sectors have already acquired that level.Even Germany and other economies in Western Europe will not sever all their connections with the Russian economy.Sputnik: How do you view the responses of China and India? Will western countries buy into the arguments made by the two countries?Dr. Zorawar Daulet Singh: Ironically, China and India do have similar opinions on the Ukraine crisis. These Asian powers have their own reasons for cultivating and maintaining a deep partnership with Moscow. Both India and China value the strategic partnership with Russia. For China, it provides strategic depth and stability to counterbalance the US in the Western Pacific and, more broadly, in the international system. For India, Russia has always played a critical role as a reliable great power friend in an uncertain world - whether to manage China's rise, offset the old US-Pakistan alliance, insurance against US-China duopoly, and developing India's military strength. So it is natural that India and China are going to respond to the Ukraine conflict in a measured and restrained way. Of course, both Delhi and Beijing strongly believe in the concept of sovereignty and territorial integrity but both also see the lead up to this crisis as very much part of a complex history where it was a relentless encroachment by NATO after the end of the Cold War deeper and deeper into Eastern Europe and up to a point where it was poised to acquire a member state literally at Russiaâ€™s doorstep.There does seem to be a degree of empathy and geopolitical understanding that Russia has legitimate security interests, with both Delhi and Beijing recognising the deeper causes and provocations that preceded Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.India has a different level of relationship with the US and the West than China does. I do not see the US succeeding in using the Ukrainian crisis to diminish Indo-Russian relations or alter them in any significant way. That simply won't happen.More broadly, India's strategic establishment - driven today largely by pragmatic and realistic precepts - understands that great powers will intervene in their peripheries. Indians have also seen interventions by the US in far-flung regions of the globe that went beyond any normal definition of security and threats. This idea of getting India to bind by certain principles and adopting an anti-Russia stance will not have much of an impact in New Delhi.Sputnik: How will this crisis impact the Indo-Pacific region as we see the US forming new alliances such as Quad and AUKUS in this region?Dr. Zorawar Daulet Singh: What will be the ripple effects and repercussions of the Ukraine crisis in the rest of Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific? This is a significant question and should occupy policymakers in Washington today. The notion that the US could pursue a policy of containment towards Russia at the same time pivot towards Asia and the Indo-Pacific to manage a rising China and to ensure that Asia does not fall under the sway of a new rising power has been the great delusion. Such a level of ambition was becoming simply unsustainable because the power gap between the US and the rest has been narrowing over the past decade.The US should now ask itself whether further confrontation with Russia undermines its broader strategic goals in Asia - the managing of China's rise. Given the ideological proclivities of policymakers in Washington, in London, in Brussels, it does appear there is a deeper reluctance to change course. In recent years, the US has been trying to strengthen old alliances and develop new partnerships in the Indo-Pacific that are very much centred on managing China's rise. That strategy will certainly face an uphill task if the US-Russia crisis leads Moscow to deepen ties with China further and take positions in the Indo-Pacific that are far more antagonistic to the US. Russia, so far, has not extended the level of military strategic activities to truly impact US security or the security of US allies in the Indo-Pacific. They have been far more measured, including in their military exercises with China. But should that become an important part of Russian security policies, it would obviously undermine the US' grand strategy in the Indo-pacific.

Three Turkish-sourced Ukrainian Bayraktar TB-2 strike drones were shot down in the suburbs of Chernigov, and an S-300 air defence complex was rendered inoperable in the area of the city of Kramatorsk during Russia's ongoing military operation in Ukraine, Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Sunday.Six other air defence systems, including Buk M1 and Osa missile systems, as well as 56 radar stations, were also destroyed during Sunday's operations, Konashenkov said.Some 1,067 objects of Ukrainian military infrastructure have been destroyed during the operation to date, including 254 tanks and other armoured vehicles, 31 grounded aircraft, 46 heavy multiple launch rocket artillery systems, and 103 artillery guns and mortars, the MoD spokesman said.Russian troops have suffered casualties, including dead and wounded, Konashenkov said. These are ""many times"" below those of among Ukrainian nationalist formations, and those of the regular Ukrainian army, he said. The spokesman did not elaborate on specific casualty figures, however.According to the MoD, Donetsk People's Republic forces have advanced six kilometers, freeing the settlements of Nizhneye, Granitnoe and Gnutovo, while Lugansk People's Republic forces pushed forward four kilometers with Russian fire support.The Ukrainian military inherited 6,500 tanks, 7,000 armoured vehicles, over 1,500 combat aircraft and more 350 ships after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, becoming one of the largest and most powerful armies in Europe overnight. In the decades since, many of these systems have been scrapped or sold to other countries, with the remainder upgraded. Following the 2014 western-backed coup d'etat in Kiev, Ukraine began receiving military equipment and training from NATO. US deliveries were initially limited to ""non-lethal"" supplies, including hundreds of Humvees, during the Obama administration, but under Donald Trump and Joe Biden grew to include lethal weapons including Javelin anti-tank systems and man-portable air defence equipment. President Biden signed off on an additional $350 million in military aid to Ukraine on Saturday, bringing the NATO total to nearly $3 billion.The Kiev government has been at war with breakaway forces in the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk since the spring of 2014, when the new authorities in the Ukrainian capital sent troops to try to crush the Donbass uprisings by force. At least 13,000 people were killed in the conflict and over 33,000 people were wounded, with 2.5 million civilians forced to flee their homes, one million of them to neighbouring Russia. In February 2015, Ukraine's president met with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France in Minsk, Belarus to hammer out the Minsk Agreements - aimed at ending the civil war by reintegrating the Donbass into Ukraine in exchange for constitutionally-guaranteed autonomy. In the years that followed, Kiev refused to implement the Minsk peace deal, with an attempt to do so by President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019 scuttled after tens of thousands of ultranationalists and veterans of the war in the Donbass took to the streets of Kiev and threatened to overthrow him. Since then, the conflict continued, with the shaky ceasefire punctuated by artillery and mortar fire or sniper attacks on almost a daily basis.On 21 February, amid a Ukrainian military buildup near Donbass and reports of hundreds of violations of the ceasefire by OSCE observers, Russia took the unprecedented step of recognising the Donbass breakaways as independent republics. Days later, on the night of 23 February, amid continued Ukrainian attacks, the states formally asked Russia for military assistance. On the morning of 24 February, Moscow launched what President Putin referred to as a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine to ""demilitarise and denazify"" the country.

Russia and Ukraine Engage in Negotiations; Investors Brace for Volatile Markets Ukrainian and Russian diplomats met today near the Belarus border to work on a resolution to hostilities.

Mark Sleboda, Moscow-based international relations security analyst, joins us to discuss the Ukrainian military operation. Ukrainian and Russian diplomats met today near the Belarus border to work on a resolution to hostilities. The Russians have made clear demands that the Eastern European nation must pledge to remain neutral and free from US/NATO and Nazi influence.Jack Rasmus, professor in economics and politics at St. Mary's College in California, joins us to discuss the economy. Investors are bracing for a hostile and volatile world market as draconian sanctions against Russia threaten to destabilize the world economy. Russia has taken internal actions to dampen the effects, and the EU is considering additional actions.Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst and co-founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, joins us to discuss the implications of the Ukraine conflict on great world powers. The Russian operation to rid its border of a major NATO military base of operations will have major implications on changing the power dynamics of the three great world powers. The unipolar hegemony of the US empire is being challenged by Russia as Iran, Venezuela, and China watch and wait.Steve Poikonen, national organizer for Action4Assange, joins us to discuss Julian Assange. Julian Assange's unwillingness to trade his integrity for power and freedom set him apart from his tormentors.

Selective Swift Sanctions, Crypto and US Military Intervention Ahead of the State of the Union Calls for US Backed Insurgency in Ukraine

Mark Sleboda, foreign affairs and policy analyst joins at the top of the show to break down the strategy that is unfolding in Ukraine as attacks on infrastructure intensify near Kiev. They also talked about how much military aid is being supplied by NATO to the Ukrainian military. Weapons are going into west Ukraine to support an insurgency according to Sleboda.Dr. Jack Rasmus, economist, radio show host & author of 'The Scourge of Neoliberalism: US Economic Policy from Reagan to Trump, 2020 and Central Bankers at the End of Their Ropes: Monetary Policy and the Coming Depression joins the show to talk about how much sanctions slammed on Russia will impact its economy and economies beyond Russia's border. No one really knows if sanctions will turn around and take a bite out of the US and European economies, that remains to be seen, according to Dr, Rasmus. The real economy in Russia is connected to natural gas and oil sales, not the stock market. It will be difficult for the global economy to make up for the loss of Russiaâ€™s oil and natural gas. The Russian stock market remains closed since the beginning of the conflict and not slated to open until Monday. Russia is using Crypto to circumvent sanctions and using it in place of the banking systems that Russians do not have access to Dr. Rasmus said.Next, KJ Noh, a global justice activist, writer, teacher, and member of Veterans for Peace joins the conversation to talk about the misinformation media war while trying to navigate the fog of war. The Misfits talk about the role of censorship in media: the EU banned Sputnik News and RT what does this type of action portend for media that does not align with a Western ideology and bandwidth?The Misfits discuss Russiaâ€™s relationship with China. What is China anticipating following sanctions placed on one of their major trade partners? China wants peace and will lift all wheat- import restrictions on Russia. Then they talk about the kind of assistance China will offer to Russia. China declares a multipolar world and economy a drive toward centralized digital currencies. And, China supports Russiaâ€™s security interest. The root cause of this crisis is the US and the Western expansion of NATO just as China possesses similar security concerns in the Pacific according to Noh.For the last segment, John Kane, Mohawk activist and educator, producer and host of the Let's Talk Native Podcast, and co-host of Resistance Radio on WBAI Pacifica Radio NY joins the show to talk about the Supreme Court taking up a challenge to the Indian Child Welfare Act. The battleground is over child placement. Overturning the legislation could potentially remove large amounts of regulations protecting tribes and their members. Forceable moving children from native households to place them with a white family. Texas, Louisiana and Indiana are challenging the child protection law they claim the law is racist and violates the 14th Amendment. Kane says thatâ€™s why the law is failing because it does not recognize the sovereignty and distinct cultural identities of native tribes. If SCOTUS overturns the legislation Indian casinos are at risk of loosing regulated gaming privileges which is important to native economies because there is no state income tax base on tribal lands.The Misfits sign off till tomorrow.We'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.com

Prominent Indian Muslim parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi has criticised Ukraine's Ambassador to Delhi Igor Polikha after the diplomat compared the ongoing Russian ""special military operation"" in his country to the ""massacre arranged against Rajputs by Mughals"".""We are asking every time all influential world leaders, among them [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi Ji, to use every resource against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to stop the bombing and shelling"", Polikha said during an interview with the news agency ANI on 1 March, after his meeting with Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla.The appeal for Indian diplomatic support by the Ukrainian envoy has triggered outcry among many people in the South Asian country, with several social media users even accusing Polikha of ""demonising Muslims"".Several other prominent social media handles also criticised the Ukrainian diplomat for his ""polarising appeal"".The Mughal Legacy in IndiaThe Mughal Empire came into being in the 16th century (1526), after an Islamic-Turkic tribe from Central Asia invaded the Gangetic plains of northern India. By 1529, Babur, a descendant of Mongol chieftain Genghis Khan, declared himself the undisputed king of the subcontinent. Babur's descendants ruled India for more than 300 years.Some Indian historians credit the Mughals with bringing India together under a single rule for the first time in centuries as well as building world-renowned monuments such as the Taj Mahal and Red Fort. The legacy of the Mughal Empire in India has largely been seen as positive for most of the country's post-independence history, reflected in the naming of prominent Indian streets and thoroughfares after the Mughal emperors.Yet, many Hindu nationalists in India also consider the Mughals as ""invaders"" and accuse the Mughal kings of subverting Hinduism at the expense of promoting Islam on the subcontinent. The disputed legacy has been further accentuated since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014, with many prominent backers of the government castigating the Mughal emperors for decimating Hindu kingdoms.Many Hindu nationalist supporters of the BJP have also called upon the authorities to revise academic texts taught at Indian schools and universities, so as not to glorify the Mughal Empire.The Rajputs, on the other hand, comprised a series of Hindu warrior kingdoms in the state of Rajasthan. During the Mughal expansion, the Rajput kings are said to have valiantly resisted their expansionary onslaught.India's Official Position Based on 'Careful Considerations': Foreign SecretaryMeanwhile, Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said at a media briefing on Tuesday evening that New Delhi's official position in the ongoing events in Ukraine was based on ""very careful considerations"".The Indian diplomat remarked that India's stance on all the UN-linked resolutions will be taken in New Delhi's ""best interests"". The remarks were made in the wake of the killing of a stranded Indian student in shelling in Kharkov on Tuesday, as fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces intensifies.On Sunday, India abstained from a procedural vote on convening a special emergency session of the UN General Assembly over the security situation in Ukraine. The vote at the UN Security Council was backed by 11 member states, with the UAE and China also abstaining from casting their ballot. Russia voted against the proposal.At the time, New Delhi also backed the first round of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations at the Belarus border.Pursuant to the voting, the UN General Assembly will convene later on Wednesday to vote on a resolution on the Ukraine crisis. India's Permanent Representative to the UN T.S. Tirumurti called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and return to dialogue to solve the differences between Kiev and Moscow. India has also called for respecting the ""legitimate security concerns"" of all sides in the crisis.On 25 February, India, China, and the UAE abstained from voting on a US-backed resolution which deplored Russia's ""aggression"" in Ukraine.The Russian military operation in Ukraine entered its seventh day on Wednesday, with the Defence Ministry stating at a briefing that the city of Kherson has been taken. Russian forces have also launched strikes on critical enemy infrastructure in the capital Kiev, with a strike on Tuesday taking out a TV tower, which the Defence Ministry said was being employed by the Ukrainian regime for psychological operations. Moscow has maintained all through its campaign that its aim is to neutralise the military infrastructure of Kiev, without any intention of targeting civilians.On Wednesday, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace rejected Ukrainian calls to impose a ""no-fly zone"" over the country in order to check the rapidly advancing Russian forces, warning that any such action could pit the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) directly against Moscow.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said that the country's army has not and will not take part in Russia's special military operation in Ukraine. The latter has been underway since 24 February.Lukashenko stressed that Belarusian forces are currently employed in guarding the nation's border against external threats. He added that special attention is being paid to the western and northwestern portion of the border with the EU.The president underscored that the country's military will fight and die protecting their homeland, but expressed hope it won't come to that.Lukashenko thus once again rejected allegations by Ukraine that Belarus is aiding Russia in its special military operation, which Kiev calls an ""invasion"". The operation was ordered by President Vladimir Putin on 24 February. He said that Russia was left with no other choice after Kiev essentially gave up on fulfilling the Minsk agreements opting for a military option to resolve the conflict with the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR).The Russian president outlined the goals of the operation as demilitarisation â€“ the removal of weapons endangering Russia, including possibly nuclear devices that Kiev threatened to obtain, and to de-Nazify the country â€“ removing nationalists from its leadership and defeating nationalist battalions.Western nations slapped Russia with harsh economic sanctions in response to the start of the operation. They also imposed sanctions on Minsk, whom they accuse of aiding Moscow in the operation, despite Minsk denying it.

""On the eve of the start of the operation, the Western media pushed the narrative of the Russian Army's allegedly unreasonable concentration on the border [with Ukraine]. Meanwhile, in previous years, NATO, under the pretext of exercises, sent a large number of troops to the Russian borders from the Baltic to the Black Sea. These exercises posed a threat to Russia. Shortly before the start of the Russian special operation, the Ukrainian Army began massive artillery shelling of Donbass"", says Hasan Erel, political observer and former editor at the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT).The Western media campaign accusing Russia of planning to invade and occupy Ukraine started in spring 2021. In April 2021, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki claimed Russian troop numbers near Ukrainian borders were the ""highest"" since 2014.In November 2021, the narrative got its second breath with Bloomberg claiming that the US had intelligence of Russia's alleged offensive against Ukraine, admitting at the same time that it wasn't clear whether Moscow would really invade. Under the pretext of an apparent ""invasion"", the US and its NATO allies stepped up deliveries of lethal weapons to Ukraine while thousands of NATO troops were sent to Eastern European NATO member states to ""deter"" Russia.Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Army had amassed a large contingent along the line of contact with Donbass as well as heavy weaponry prohibited under the Minsk agreements. On 26 October 2021, the Ukrainian Army used a Turkish Bayraktar drone for the first time against the Donbass self-defence forces. By December 2021, Kiev had concentrated around 125,000 troops near the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, and gradually intensified shelling of the region.While Ukraine's military buildup was going on, Russia in mid-December 2021 sent draft security agreements to Washington and NATO which envisaged the alliance's non-expansion, Ukraine's non-admission into the military bloc, non-deployment of offensive weapons systems near Russia's borders, and the return of the bloc's European capabilities and infrastructure to 1997 levels. Moscow warned Western states that if its proposals were dismissed, a military-technical option was also on the table. However, Russia's key security proposals were dismissed by the US, NATO, and the EU in late January 2022. In early February, the Ukrainian government made it clear that it would not engage in direct negotiations with the leadership of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, thus upending the process which Kiev had already snubbed for almost eight years.Hotbed of Instability in UkraineDe facto, the US and its NATO allies have intentionally created a hotbed of instability in Ukraine and provoked a military conflict by encouraging Kiev not to implement the Minsk Agreements and providing training to the Ukrainian neo-Nazi battalion Azov and radical nationalist groups, according to Erel. Furthermore, under Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Dmitry Yarosh, Ukrainian ultra-nationalist and ex-Right Sector leader, was appointed chief adviser to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in November 2021. The Right Sector was established in 2013 as an umbrella organization for a whole set of nationalist and neo-Nazi groups, including the Patriots of Ukraine, Trizub, SNA, UNA-UNSO, and White Hammer.""President [Volodymyr] Zelensky demonstrates dependence on the United States in every step he takes. It was he who, in fact, threw his country under the bus"", says the Turkish political observer. ""[Still] the responsibility for this process lies entirely with the United States. They are trying to use this process to change the government in Russia. However, this time they face not Libya, Syria or Yugoslavia, but a powerful state with a nuclear potential"".Russia's ongoing special operation in Ukraine shouldn't be ripped out of the context of NATO's post-Cold War expansion, according to Turkish journalist Alptekin Dursunoglu.If one takes a look at the countries of Latin America, one would see that the US has openly tried to asphyxiate Cuba and Venezuela, according to the Turkish journalist. The US is not only financially supporting opponents of the sitting governments, it is carrying out regime change operations, resorting to outright invasions and assassination attempts, he notes.""In this situation, they are trying to create a front in Ukraine, bordering Russia, and at the same time they accuse Russia, which seeks to protect itself, of actions contrary to international law"", Dursunoglu concludes, denouncing Washington's double-standard approach. ""This is completely unacceptable"".

The Russian armed forces have destroyed a large warehouse hosting Javelin and NLAW anti-tank missile systems in Zhitomir with precision-guided weapons, spokesman for the Defence Ministry Major General Igor Konashenkov announced on Saturday.Konashenkov added that over 2,000 military facilities have been destroyed by the Russian forces in Ukraine since the beginning of Moscow's special military operation last week. These facilities include 71 command and communication centres, 98 S-300 anti-missile systems, Buk M-1 and Osa anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as 61 radars.""Sixty-six aircraft have been destroyed on the ground and sixteen in the air; 708 tanks and other armoured vehicles, 74 launch rocket systems, 261 mortars, 505 military vehicles, and 56 UAVs"", the major general said.He also commented on the continuing fight between the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) forces and the Ukrainian neo-Nazi battalions ""Azov"" and ""Aidar"" around the town of Mariupol. According to Konashenkov, Ukrainian militants were firing at DPR troops from combat positions previously set up at schools, kindergartens, and hospitals.In the past 24 hours, Russian forces took control of 10 more villages and towns, with troops of the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) having advanced further across the frontline, while the DPR forces advanced 27 km and liberated Novogrigorovka, Novonikolayevka, Vishnevatoye, Volnoye, Listvyanka, and Antonovka.On 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a special military operation in Ukraine aimed at protecting the population in Ukraine's breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk - that were recognised by Russia as sovereign nations on 21 February - and also in order to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Russian forces do not carry out strikes on Ukrainian cities and only target the country's military infrastructure with high-precision strikes. The Russian operation has provoked a backlash from NATO, the US, and its allies across the globe, with many countries imposing strict economic sanctions against Russia. Although NATO has repeatedly said that it is not a party to the conflict in Ukraine, its member countries have long been providing financial and technical support to Kiev, including weapons and military aircraft.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted to use a fire at the Zaporozhskaya nuclear power plant in order to make the West impose a no-fly zone over the country, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov has said.The ex-official described the incident at the NPP as a deliberate provocation that was carefully designed. Azarov then pointed to President Zelensky's reaction to the news â€“ a request to the West introduce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""The fire occurred at night and he immediately addressed the United States and Britain. This shows that it was a planned provocation"", he said.Azarov's statement echoes that of the Russian Defence Ministry. On Friday, Major General Igor Konashenkov said that a group of Russian National Guard officers came under attack from Ukrainian saboteurs while patrolling the territory of the Zaporozhskaya NPP. The Russian servicemen repelled the attack, but as the saboteurs were leaving they set the plant on fire, Konashenkov said.The Russian Defence Ministry emphasised that the plant's employees are working as normal and are monitoring the situation. Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi confirmed there was no radiation release as a result of the incident and said the safety systems of the six reactors were not affected by the fire.On Friday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the issue of introducing a no-fly zone was mentioned during the extraordinary meeting of the alliance's foreign ministers, but noted that NATO believes that its planes and forces should not be sent to Ukraine.On 24 February, Russia launched a special operation in Ukraine. It was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and according to the head of state its aim is to ""de-Nazify"" and demilitarise Kiev as well as protect the residents of two breakaway regions, the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR).President Putin said that Russia does not plan to occupy Ukraine and that there is no threat to the civilian population as Russian forces are only targeting the country's military infrastructure - military bases and air defence systems. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the Russian special operation as a ""full-scale invasion"" and rejected statements about Nazis being present in Ukraine. Western nations have thrown their support behind Kiev, condemning Moscow's actions, and introducing the harshest sanctions on Russia to date.Commenting on Russia's special operation, Nikolay Azarov praised Vladimir Putin's decision, saying the president has saved ""hundreds of thousands of lives of the [Donbass] republics"".

The US started to send millions of dollars' worth of lethal weapons and military equipment to Ukraine back in December 2021, The Washington Post has reported, citing obtained declassified accounting of transfers and sales.According to the documents seen by the newspaper, Washington was sending Ukraine weapons useful for urban combat, such as M141 single-shot shoulder-launched rocket launchers, M500 shotguns, Mk-19 grenade launchers, as well as M134 mini guns, which Kiev could install on military helicopters. In addition, the US reportedly sent protective suits for disposing undetonated explosive ordnances.The late December shipments cost around $200 million, the documents reportedly show.Additional shipments of equipment and weaponry for Ukraine worth $350 million were approved in late February 2022. Some $240 million of it has already been delivered, according to The Washington Post citing an anonymous senior defence official. This last shipment included Stinger man-portable air defence systems, the newspaper's source said.The latest shipments to Ukraine also included Javelin missile systems, which are being used by the Ukrainian military and nationalist battalions to target Russian armoured vehicles. Washington has been shipping and selling Javelins in the hundreds to Ukraine at least since 2018. It ignored calls from Russia to stop ""pumping"" Ukraine with weapons as Moscow argued it may exacerbate the conflict in Donbass and prompt Kiev to resolve it militarily.On 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia was left with no choice but to start a special military operation in Ukraine, after Kiev failed to implement the Minsk agreements and threatened to obtain nuclear weapons by withdrawing from the Budapest Memorandum. Putin said that the goal of the mission is to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine. Kiev and its western allies call Russia's mission an ""invasion"", with the Ukrainian government urging NATO to intervene.

Former national security advisor John Bolton has accused his former boss Donald Trump of planning to pull the US out of NATO if elected for a second term, and said that Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin was â€œwaitingâ€ for this eventuality.Commenting on his memoir, â€˜The Room Where It Happenedâ€™, in which Bolton claimed that the US had already come dangerously close to pullout out of NATO in 2018, the former national security advisor said that he had his â€œheart in [his] throatâ€ at a meeting where this possibility was raised.â€œI didnâ€™t know what the president would do. He called me up to his seat seconds before he gave his speech. And I said, â€˜Look, go right up to the line, but donâ€™t go over itâ€™. I sat back down, I had no idea what heâ€™d do. I thought heâ€™d put his foot over it, but at least he didnâ€™t withdraw then,â€ Bolton said.A Trump spokesperson dismissed Boltonâ€™s claims, suggesting that the foreign policy hawk was â€œonly happy when America is at war.â€Commenting on Boltonâ€™s remarks, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki suggested they were â€œanother reason whyâ€ the majority Americans were â€œgratefulâ€ â€œthat President Biden has not taken a page out of his predecessorsâ€™ playbook as it relates to global engagement and global leadership, because, certainly, we would be in a different place.â€Russia Sanctions Not Tough EnoughBolton blasted the Biden effort to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2021 as a â€œcatastrophic strategic mistake,â€ suggesting the US was not â€œtough enoughâ€ and that Putin had seen US threats as â€œnot credible.â€â€œI said at the time, others did as well that you had to begin imposing costs on Putin before he went in[to Ukraine],â€ the former official said. â€œI would have imposed costs on Russia in real time until they withdrew from the Donbass and frankly from Crimea. I would have cut Nord Stream off earlier, I would have begun the imposition of sanctions because of the threat that they were posing,â€ Bolton added.The neocon praised the sanctions imposed by the US and its allies against Russia, but suggested they were not tough enough.The former official suggested that President Bidenâ€™s comments on a no-fly zone being out of the question were a â€œbig mistake,â€ saying that â€œif Putinâ€™s mere threat gets us to do something that he wants, he is getting it for free. Itâ€™s a serious matter. It requires careful consideration. But youâ€™re saying thereâ€™s no difference between some use of force and all-out nuclear warfare is just wrong.â€ He added that one possibility would be to set up a no-fly zone only over Western Ukraine.US lawmakers have so far shied away from establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, fearing that it could escalate the risk of a direct military confrontation with Moscow.Bolton also rejected Russian-Ukraine peace negotiations, advising against â€œproviding off-ramps at this point.â€Bolton served as Donald Trumpâ€™s national security advisor between April 2018 and September 2019, when he was fired over numerous policy disagreements with his boss. Before that, he served in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, and acted as one of the key architects of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.Bolton and Trump had a very public falling out after the neocon was fired from his post as national security advisor. Bolton subsequently released a memoir accusing the then-president of a broad range of foolish and potentially incriminating behaviour. Trump dismissed the claims, calling Bolton a â€œtraitor,â€ a â€œdolt,â€ a â€œboring foolâ€ and â€œone of the dumbest people in Washington.â€ In one interview, Trump suggested that the United States â€œwould be in World War Six by nowâ€ if he had listened to Boltonâ€™s advice.Since leaving office, Bolton has provided Biden with a range of policy advice, urging him to take out â€œtwo-faced Pakistanâ€™sâ€ nuclear capabilities, claiming that the Taliban* could get access to nuclear weapons, calling on NATO to â€œstand up to Russiaâ€ amid the Ukraine escalation, calling on Washington to overthrow the Belarusian government, and slamming attempts to restore the Iran nuclear deal.* An organization under United Nations sanctions over terrorist activities.

US lawmakers from both the Republican and Democratic parties have shied away from Kievâ€™s request to establish a no-fly zone over the country, citing the danger of a direct military confrontation with Russia.â€œOne thing is certainly true: shooting down Russian planes would require a declaration of war from Congress â€“ which isnâ€™t happening,â€ Murphy later tweeted.â€œAnd I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s in the best interest of NATO, our partners and allies and friends. But what we can do is provide all the defensive mechanisms for President Zelensky and his armed services to provide their own protected airspace. And that starts, of course, with providing air platforms to President Zelensky, making sure that those pilots are able to protect their own airspace,â€ she said.The Biden White House has repeatedly eschewed the idea of a US or NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine.Senator Joe Manchin â€“ the West Virginia Democrat known for taking stances opposed to Bidenâ€™s, told Meet the Press he would â€œtake nothing off the tableâ€ when it comes to the crisis in Ukraine. â€œBut I would let â€“ be very clear that weâ€™re going to support the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian president and his government in every way humanely possible,â€ Manchin said.Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Saturday that Moscow would treat any aircraft or other military assets seeking to impose a no-fly zone as a military target.â€œWe are hearing voices that a no-fly zone should be imposed over Ukraine. It is impossible to do this in Ukraine. It can only be done from the territory of neighbouring states. However, we will consider any move in this direction as participation in the armed conflict of the country from whose territory a threat to our servicemen is created. We will consider them participants in hostilities that very second. Their membership in any organization will not matter. So I hope the understanding of this is there and it will not come to this,â€ Putin said.Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek indicated Monday that a decision by NATO to set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine would â€œmean a large-scale military operation beyond the North Atlantic Allianceâ€™s borders,â€ and be outside the bounds of legality.US and NATO-instituted no-fly zones were implemented against Iraq, Bosnia and Libya at various points between 1991 and 2019, with the Libya no-fly zone used as a justification for NATO forces to bomb Muammar Gaddafi loyalist forces in 2011. The operation ended with Gaddafiâ€™s overthrow, and Libya was turned into a failed state.The civil aviation organizations of the US and other countries prohibit or advise against flights in a number of other nations or regions, including eastern Ukraine and Crimea, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Egyptâ€™s northern Sinai, northern Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Is There a Chance for Peace and Diplomacy to End Conflict in Ukraine? John Kiriakou talks about a ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine, boycotts of Russian oil, women raped by prison staff and the spike in defense spending in the US and Europe.

At the top of the show, Dr. Jeremy Kuzmarov, managing editor of Covert Action Magazine and the author of four books, joins John to discuss the latest developments from Ukraine. They talk about whether a ceasefire can hold in the region and the potential for a diplomatic outcome that could end the conflict. Meanwhile, the United States and its allies have provided Ukraine with thousands of anti-tank rockets and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. The Russian government has been clear with what it wants from Ukraine, which consists of the reunification of Crimea being recognized; Donetsk and Luhansk being recognized as independent republics; and assurances that Ukraine will never join NATO. They then discuss the continuation of talks over the Iran nuclear deal and a delegation of US senatorsâ€™ visit to Venezuela over the weekend. The conversations were about Venezuelan oil and the potential release of six Citgo employees accused by the Venezuelans of money laundering.Next, Dr. Robert Hockett, Edward Cornell Professor of Law and of Public Policy at Cornell University, senior counsel at Westwood Capital and fellow at the Century Foundation, calls in to the program to talk about the recent spike in defense spending by the US and Europe. Things are always great for the Military Industrial Complex when a war breaks out. Congress is planning this week to appropriate another $10 billion in emergency aid to Ukraine. When something like this happens, the US doesnâ€™t just send cash. It doesnâ€™t just go to a warehouse, pull stuff out, and put it on a ship. It buys the equipment and materiel from defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing. As a result, their stock prices are skyrocketing and a lot of people are getting rich.During the second hour, Paul Wright, Executive Director of the Human Rights Defense Center and the editor-in-chief of Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News magazines, joins the show to talk about a situation at a womenâ€™s prison in California called FCI Dublin. It was in the news because of something called a â€œrape club,â€ where staff members were raping prisoners in exchange for things like extra commissary or phone calls home. They talk about how the Bureau of Prisons is the largest and best-funded bureau in the Department of Justice. Why is it that the BOP canâ€™t keep a director for more than a couple years? Is there anything that a prisoner can do to protect herself or himself? We have the Prison Rape Elimination Act, but what does a person do when the rapist is a guard or a warden? And is Congress doing anything at all to improve prison conditions? More than half of all rapes in prisons involve prison staff, according to Wright.For the last segment, Morgan Artyukhina, staff writer at Sputnik News, joins John in the studio to talk about President Biden planning a visit to Saudi Arabia. On November 21, 2019, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden said these words related to Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman Al Saud: â€œJamal Khashoggi was, in fact, murdered and dismembered, and I believe on the order of the crown prince. And, I would make it very clear we were not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them, we were going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are. Thereâ€™s very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia. And, I would also end the sale of material to the Saudis where theyâ€™re going in and murdering children, and theyâ€™re murdering innocent people. And, so they have to be held accountable.â€ Today, the White House confirmed that President Biden is planning a trip to Saudi Arabia to meet with the Crown Prince he called a murderer to ask that the Saudis raise production of oil to offset the loss of Russian oil in the marketplace.We'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.comThe views and opinions expressed in this program are those of the speakers and do not necessarily reflect the position of Sputnik.

Indiaâ€™s neutral stance on Ukraine and its abstentions on several United Nations (UN) resolutions labelling Russia the â€œaggressorâ€ has been praised by Moscow. But this has raised some concerns in the US and among some of its western partners about New Delhi's reliability as a strategic partner.Sputnik caught up with Air Marshal Muthumanikam Matheswaran, a former fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force (IAF) and a founder member of Indiaâ€™s Nuclear Command who has also served as the deputy chief at the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS).Matheswaran is now president of the Peninsula Foundation, an Indian policy research think-tank focused on foreign affairs and security matters.The Indian defence veteran explained how he interprets the ongoing developments in eastern Europe and the larger geopolitical implications of the present security crisis.Sputnik: Who's to blame, in your opinion, for the present security crisis in Ukraine?Muthumanikam Matheswaran: One of the most important points is that Russia has been pushed into this conflict. Russia is not only the successor to the former Soviet Union but also a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). So, it's only natural that it is sensitive about its security interests.It was a given at the end of the Cold War that many of the European nations would integrate culturally and economically with the European Union (EU). However, western security systems to deal with the Cold War remained intact. NATOâ€™s relevance or irrelevance should be looked at from two perspectives. It has been used, whether in Yugoslavia, Iraq or Afghanistan, to bypass the United Nations (UN). It is a tool to ensure America's power throughout the world. And obviously, NATOâ€™s expansion into former Soviet republics - for instance Hungary or Poland - is pushing Russia into a place where it would react.Sputnik: How do you assess Russiaâ€™s military capabilities in Ukraine?Muthumanikam Matheswaran: The view of certain western countries that Russian forces are struggling to achieve their military goals in Ukraine is deliberately misleading. I see it as western propaganda.President Vladimir Putin wants to send a message that Russians are not enemies of the Ukrainians and there seems to be a focus on building bridges with them. There are already several regions in Ukraine with a large Russian-speaking population and affinity with Russia.Sputnik: Do you believe New Delhiâ€™s neutral stance on Ukraine would affect its ties with the US?Muthumanikam Matheswaran: India is a rising power and it must keep in mind its relations with all the major powers, be it the US, Russia, China or the European Union (EU).At the same time, India has also been growing its ties with Ukraine, particularly in the science and technology sector.I would say that the most important thing for India is for it not to jump onto a US-led chorus to isolate Russia economically, culturally and politically. This would be bad not only for India but also for the rest of the world.So, India's policy of abstaining from partisan voting at the UN and encouraging a dialogue between Russia and the West is quite correct and a stance I fully support.Sputnik: How do you think China will be affected by this crisis? Does it gain from it or get adversely affected?Muthumanikam Matheswaran: Well, the point of expanding NATO into eastern Europe is essentially to enlarge the EUâ€™s economic and strategic power. This, in turn, is designed to hurt - either directly or indirectly - Russiaâ€™s influence in the Eurasian region.And all this is happening as the international order is being restructured because of the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between the US and China. So, all these factors are bound to bring China and Russia closer to each other, be it politically, economically or militarily.Sputnik: China has expressed concerns about the alignment of interests between India and the US in the Asia-Pacific region. India and China have also been embroiled in a tense military stand-off at their shared border since 2020. So, should India be worried by the fact that Russia and China are bound to get closer in the future?Muthumanikam Matheswaran: As far as Russian-Indian ties are concerned, Moscow has always played a positive role in New Delhiâ€™s foreign policy. Russia may even effect a dialogue between China and India to resolve their differences. But letâ€™s be clear about one thing: the border stand-off has to be solved bilaterally by India and China, both of which are rising powers. They have to find a middle ground.These factors are going to remain in play between the two countries for some time.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, referring to a recent report from The New York Times, condemned on Wednesday speculation that Chinese authorities knew in advance about the decision of President Vladimir Putin to start the special operation in Ukraine.The article from 2 March claimed, citing top US and European officials, whose conclusions were based on a secret Western intelligence report that Beijing allegedly had direct information about Russia's plans regarding the special operation.According to the report, China was not aiming to preserve peace and security, but to protect its Winter Olympics from being overshadowed by conflict. Chinese leader Xi Jinping reportedly asked President Putin to delay the launch of the operation until after the Olympics.Zhao noted that the US criticizes China's position on Ukraine in order to â€œseek space for the plot of simultaneously suppressing China and Russia.â€He claimed that the Ukraine issue has evolved to what it is today partly because of NATOâ€™s actions.â€œThe more it racks its brains to discredit China with lies and hype things up, the more it exposes its credibility deficit to the international community,â€ he concluded.Speculation was fueled, among other things, by the latest Putin-Xi summit in Beijing that took place ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games on 4 February. Both leaders pledged to stand together in a â€œnew eraâ€ of international relations and global strategic stability.After the special operation started at the end of February, China abstained from voting during the meeting of the UN Security Council on 27 February on the resolution to convene a special session of the General Assembly on Ukraine. Later, Permanent Representative of China to the UN Zhang Jun said that the resolution adopted later by the UN General Assembly to condemn Russia's special operation did not take into account the history and complexity of the crisis.On 8 March, he stressed the importance of equal dialogue between the US, NATO and the European Union with Russia, and attention to â€œMoscow's security concerns.â€ These concerns are related to the threats to Russia coming from â€œNATO's eastward enlargement for a long time,â€ according to Zhang Jun.On Wednesday, Xi Jinping said that both sides of the Ukrainian crisis should be encouraged to maintain the negotiation efforts, overcome difficulties and continue contacts. The main task for peaceful settlement at the moment, according to the Chinese president, is to prevent further escalation and not let it get out of control. He also expressed concern and regret over the current crisis in Europe.US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said in turn that Western leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, are putting pressure on China to abandon its neutral position on the conflict.Apart from that, the US has threatened to deprive Chinese companies of access to American equipment and software in case they ignore the sanctions against Russia.Let's stay in touch no matter what!

There is a real possibility that NATO will end up in a war against Russia, the alliance's former Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has claimed. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz previously outright refused to send fighter jets to assist Ukraine against Russia's special operation the West has proclaimed an â€œinvasionâ€. Nor did other European members of NATO, or the US voice any desire to escalate the conflict with Russia by sending their own troops or aircraft to Ukraine.In late February, Russia claimed complete control over Ukraine's airspace. President Vladimir Putin said any nation that imposes a no-fly zone would be considered an enemy combatant. Nevertheless, former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen wouldn't rule out NATO going to war.Per Rasmussen, Europeans must be ready for this, because the future of democracy on the continent is at stake.""I think that if it is to be a deterrent to Putin, then we shouldn't rule out anything. And I belong to those who say that we must keep Putin in maximum insecurity"", Rasmussen mused. According to Rasmussen, the West ""cannot afford"" to allow Russia to win.So far, the alliance has supported Ukraine and its defence in other ways â€“ with financial allotments and tens of thousands of arms, including anti-tank weapons and firearms. As per Rasmussen, should Russia interpret the West's assistance as a declaration of war, NATO would ultimately prevail, due to â€œdefence investments ten times larger than Russia'sâ€. To counter Russia's special operation in Ukraine launched to protect the People's Republics of Donbass and demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, the West has imposed a broad spectrum of sanctions ranging from consumer goods to banking operations. The EU, where some members are heavily reliant on Russian gas and oil, is currently discussing means of reaching energy independence.According to Rasmussen, energy from Russia must be boycotted completely â€“ and better today than tomorrow.Incidentally, it was during Rasmussen's tenure (2009-2014) that NATO invaded oil-rich Libya, plunging the country into chaos, with little to no government control and a plethora of warring factions fighting it out.

GoFundMeUkraine and Defund Russia Hysteria On this episode, selective funding by donors in conflict zones, JCPOA talks continue, and the Red Hill fuel plant closes.

At the top of the show, Nicolas J.S. Davies, independent journalist, a researcher with Code Pink and the author of ""Blood On Our Hands: The American Invasion and Destruction of Iraq,"" joins the show to talk about the latest news from Ukraine. They talk about how the press has reported today that there was a major disconnect between the US and Poland over the provision of MiG fighters to Ukraine. Then, they discuss the Friday deadline for the United States and Iran to agree on the US rejoining the JCPOA. Presumably, the US wants to be able to save face and to get Iranian oil onto the market.Next, Ariel Gold, co-executive director of Code Pink, joins the conversation to talk about the status of a new Iran nuclear deal. Over the last couple of weeks, most of the headlines have been very positive - the two sides are close, progress is being made. But yesterday, suddenly, the deal was in jeopardy again - and itâ€™s Russiaâ€™s fault? The Misfits talk about how close we are to a deal and what is Russia asking for that is so problematic?Then, they discuss that last month, Israeli human rights group Bâ€™Tselem has been documenting the establishment of a new settlement near the town of Beita in the West Bank. The back and forth of establishing and legalizing this settlement has been going on for months, and for months, Palestinians have been protesting the settlement and their separation from some of their farmland. Several people have been killed.Next on the program, Chris Garaffa, editor of TechForThePeople.org, joins the show to talk about Russia and the internet. Russia is being increasingly isolated by large internet providers including Cisco, Cogent and Lumen, who own the communication infrastructure that goes across the seas. They are cutting off their Russian clients, and thatâ€™s going to have a chilling effect on the internet from Russia. The internet is a global network and countries should not be cut off, according to Garaffa.Also in the news today, the White House announced a new executive order on ensuring responsible innovation in digital assets. This is being described as huge news, a watershed moment for cryptocurrency as Bitcoin surges on the news. Then, they talk about censorship after YouTube takes down ""Ukraine On Fire,"" a documentary by Oliver Stone.For the last segment, Steve Donziger, lawyer, writer, former journalist and environmental advocate currently known for leading an unrelenting (24 years and counting) legal battle against Chevron related to its contamination of the Ecuadorian rainforest, calls in to talk about the Pentagonâ€™s decision to permanently close the Red Hill fuel storage facility that had been leaking fuel into Pearl Harbor's drinking water for years. 6,000 people were sickened and 4,000 families had to be evacuated. The drinking water smelled of diesel fuel and had an oily sheen to it. This didnâ€™t just happen, itâ€™s been going on for years. Donziger explains the history and why it took so long to address the problem when lives were on the line.This Misfits sign off till Thursday.We'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.comThe views and opinions expressed in this program are those of the speakers and do not necessarily reflect the position of Sputnik.

""Today we are also announcing ... that we will give another $50 billion through the UN World Food Programme to assist with humanitarian aid,"" she said at a joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw.In a separate press release, the White House said that ""$53 million in new humanitarian assistance"" from the US government will support civilians in Ukraine as Russia conducts a military operation in the country. The assistance include support to the UN World Food Programme ""to provide lifesaving emergency food assistance to meet immediate needs of hundreds of thousands affected by the invasion, including people who are displaced from their homes and who are crossing the border out of Ukraine,"" it added.Harris told Duda that Washington understands the burden the current refugee crisis has put on Poland.Harris is currently in Poland and will later travel to Romania to participate in high-level talks about NATO posture adjustments and other steps being coordinated with allies in response to Russia's operation in Ukraine.The vice president will discuss with US diplomats the situation in Ukraine and efforts to help Ukrainian refugees heading to Poland. Before leaving Warsaw, Harris will meet with American and Polish troops to express support for their mission to enhance deterrence and protect collective defense, her office said.Russia began a special military operation in Ukraine on February 24 after the Donbas republics appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian forces. The Russian Defense Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only and the civilian population is not in danger. In response, Western nations have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow.Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Meta global affairs president Nick Clegg has claimed that the company ""does not tolerate Russophobia or any kind of discrimination, harassment or violence towards Russians"", and said that the new hate speech policy allowing calls for violence against Russians will be applied in Ukraine only.Talking to Sputnik, Taylor Hudak, journalist and editor with AcTVism Munich, has explained what Meta is trying to achieve with this policy, why it fits the Western narrative, and how this decision is affecting Russian citizens.Sputnik: Meta has always portrayed itself as an inclusive platform opposed to racism and xenophobia. What do you make of the media giant actually encouraging hate speech against a specific nationality?Taylor Hudak: This demonstrates how Meta and other Silicon Valley tech giants interfere in politics and foreign relations as Meta is a US government contractor. As a so-called private company, it is completely inappropriate for Meta to change its policies to support US interests and thus act as the right arm of the empire. Russian citizens are being targeted and are suffering now because of how the mainstream corporate media has spun the issue in Ukraine. Facebook and Instagram have ridiculous speech regulations and that is another issue, but to allow hate speech against one group of people while â€˜protectingâ€™ another group fosters xenophobia and racism against Russians.Sputnik: Are they going to get away with this? Are we looking at any public outcry at all?Taylor Hudak: Any serious person should be able to see that allowing for death threats against Russians is despicable. Unfortunately, this aids in the continuation of the tension and aggression between the west and Russia and it helps to serve the purpose of all out war in the region. Metaâ€™s decision to soften the hate speech regulations against Russians and Russian entities does not advance any peaceful solution but encourages more violence and aggression.Sputnik: The EU and the US have been claiming they would try to regulate Meta's activities, but it turns out that they're now neglecting clear violations. What do you make of such a double standard?Taylor Hudak: I am not surprised by the double standard here given that Meta is a US government contractor, and it is the parent company of Facebook, which openly admitted to collaborating with the FBI in the past. There is a strong propaganda effort taking place to ensure that people in the west support military aggression against Russia. After the mainstream corporate media lied about Iraq, Afghanistan, Russian interference in the 2016 election and COVID, I do not think we should ever trust them again.Sputnik: How exactly does it serve the Western narrative towards Russia?Taylor Hudak: It helps to foster anger and hatred toward Russian people and the Russian government so that people in the west will be more supportive of military aggression against Russia and not have sympathy for them.Sputnik: Where are all the human rights organisations in this?Taylor Hudak: Human rights organizations should acknowledge the censorship that happens on the traditional platforms like Twitter, for example. Twitter users who question the official western narrative regarding the conflict in Ukraine are being suspended and shadowbanned. This is never a good sign. People should have the ability to freely express themselves.Sputnik: Who gave Meta the right to decide who to hate? How is such a witch hunt against one particular nation even possible in the 21st century?Taylor Hudak: Meta/Facebook/Instagram and Twitter should not act in the interest of any government or intelligence agency. Social media and Big Tech giants serve the interests of Washington.Sputnik: Do you believe Meta's current actions should lead to enhanced regulation of social media platforms that overtly allow its users to call for violence?Taylor Hudak: I do not believe more regulation is the answer here, and I support free speech that is legal and does not call for violence in any way shape or form. The real problem is that these social media companies are tied to US intelligence and western interests. The major social media platforms do not serve the interest of their users.Let's stay in touch no matter what! Follow our Telegram channel to get all the latest news: https://t.me/sputniknewsus

Up to 180 foreign mercenaries were killed in precision strikes carried out by Russia against Ukrainian training centres located at the Yavorovsky military compound and near the settlement of Starichi, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov has stated. He elaborated that these centres were being used to train and organise foreign mercenaries to fight Russian troops in Eastern Ukraine, as well as to store weaponry sent to the country by foreign nations.In addition, the Russian Air Force and air defences destroyed several Ukrainian aircraft, including one Su-24 (NATO reporting name: Fencer) attack jet and 11 unmanned aerial aircraft. Two of them were Turkish-made Bayraktar TB-2 attack and reconnaissance drones.Russian drones also destroyed 46 military objects of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including three command centres, one air defence missile system, and two ammunition warehouses, as well as various military vehicles, the Defence Ministry's spokesman said.Moscow has repeatedly called on foreign countries to prevent their citizens from travelling to Ukraine in order to join the hostilities there as the Russian Armed Forces conduct a special military operation in the country. Moscow noted that anyone attacking Russian troops will be considered a valid target.President Vladimir Putin ordered the start of the operation on 24 February, following a request from the newly recognised Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR). He insisted that Moscow was left with no other choice after Kiev failed to implement the Minsk agreements and following continued attacks against the Donbass republics. Western countries condemned the operation, labelling it an ""invasion"" and expressed readiness to supply Ukraine with weapons, but stopped short of pledging other military assistance, citing fears of triggering a third world war.Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Aven was included in the EU sanctions list in February amid the situation in Ukraine. Last Saturday, the US Department of the Treasury also imposed new sanctions on Vekselberg, who had been previously included in Washington's sanctions list in 2018. The United States blocked a private plane and mega yacht from Vekselberg.""Any historic relationships with former donors associated with the Russian government have now ended,"" the Tate gallery said, as quoted by the news outlet.In particular, the Tate removed Vekselberg as an honorary member of Tate Foundation, despite his contribution to the development of art.""Mr Vekselberg donated to Tate seven years ago and no longer holds his honorary membership title,"" the gallery reportedly said.The Tate also severed ties with Aven, who participated in two donor programs at the gallery.""Mr Aven's support of Tate has now ended,"" the gallery added, as quoted by the newspaper.The Tate reportedly pledged to take further steps if sanctions are extended to its other partners and donors to support Ukrainians and ""join the international condemnation of Russia's invasion.""On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway Donbass republics appealed for help in defending themselves against the Ukrainian military. In response, Western nations have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Russia.

""I don't have evidence of that specifically,"" Kirby told a press briefing when asked whether Russian military in Ukraine are deliberately targeting journalists.On Sunday, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was shot and killed at a Ukrainian security checkpoint in the city of Irpin, where he had been working on a video project for American magazine Time. US photographer Juan Arredondo was traveling with Renaud and was injured in the same attack. The city is controlled by Ukrainian forces.On Monday, Fox News said its reporter was injured in Ukraine while covering the conflict outside Kiev.On February 24, Russia began a special operation to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine, responding to calls for help from the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics in countering the aggression of Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defense Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only. Several days into the operation, the Russian armed forces accused the Ukrainian military of using typical terrorist methods, such as hiding behind civilians and civilian quarters.Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Since 24 February when Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine aiming to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" the country, Israel has been trying to maintain neutrality.Although Tel Aviv did condemn Russia for its actions in Ukraine and voted against Moscow at the United Nations General Assembly, officials refused to back Western sanctions.Instead, they opted for manoeuvring, taking measures to please all sides of the conflict.Limited Restrictions:Israel has come under immense pressure from the US to join its anti-Kremlin sanctions. The Jewish state has managed to stand firm in the face of Washington's demands.It hasn't banned Russian planes from landing in Israel (even though all flights to Russia have been cancelled due to the hostilities). It hasn't forbidden Israelis from carrying out cash transactions with Russians, although monetary transfers are only possible in US dollars. It also hasn't agreed to block access to Russia's leading news channels and websites, although it has become extremely difficult to open them through the various internet browsers.Humanitarian Efforts:However, in order to please the Americans, Israel has exerted maximum efforts in helping out Ukrainian refugees and those who are still stranded in the country.Israel, which rarely accepts any refugees in order to maintain the country's Jewish identity, has allowed 5,000 Ukrainian refugees in. Reports suggest that many others are still on their way, with Israel bracing itself for up to half a million newcomers by the end of this year.Apart from making immense exceptions to its refugee policy, Israel has also started earmarking money to help the Ukrainians. Since the start of the hostilities, Israeli NGOs have come up with a number of initiatives aimed at helping the Ukrainian people. They have collected food and clothes, medicine and other necessary equipment. Some have travelled to Ukraine to treat the wounded. Others have donated money to help them out.Now, however, this assistance has been taken to yet another level. On Monday, Israel announced it would erect a make-shift hospital in the West of Ukraine, some 11 kilometres away from the Polish border. The medical facility would only operate for a month, would cost Israel some $6.5 million, and would be paid for with taxpayers' money.Mediation Efforts:Apart from cash, Israel has also stepped up its mediation efforts. Recently, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has made a brief visit to Moscow where he met Russia's President Vladimir Putin. The two have also spoken four times over the phone, and the Israeli premier suggested Jerusalem as a potential venue for a peace summit.Similar dealings have also been registered with the Ukrainians, and reports suggest that the PM maintains constant contact with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky.Not Enough:But how are these actions taken in Ukraine? For many, Israeli efforts are simply not enough. At the beginning of March, Zelensky said he was disappointed with Bennett, who was not ""wrapped"" in the Ukrainian flag.Ukrainian ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk has also slammed Tel Aviv for its â€œinactionâ€. He lamented the country had refused to provide Kiev with the Iron Dome defence system and other equipment. He criticised Israel for not sanctioning Russia, not blocking its TV channels and not taking enough refugees in.Harsh words have also been said about Israel's mediation efforts. Recently, a high-ranking official in the Ukrainian government told i24NEWS that the Jewish state was acting as a ""mailbox"" that aimed at relaying messages from one side to another. It hadn't taken an active role in resolving the conflict, he claimed.Will this criticism impact decision-makers in Israel? It's unlikely, partially because Israel and Russia have a number of common interests, including coordination in Syria and partially due to the fact that the majority of the Israeli public (67 percent) believes Israel should stay out of the raging conflict.Let's stay in touch no matter what!

""I think a lot of people, particularly in Washington, like to remind people of how serious this is - if the United States actually confronts the Russian Federation or if America's allies do,"" says Joe Siracusa, US politics expert and professor of history and diplomacy at Curtin University, Australia. ""President Biden went out of his way to say that we're not putting a boot on the ground in Ukraine because that would be World War IIIâ€¦ In the West, there is very little understanding of nuclear history since the end of the Cold War. Most media reporters and even universities in the US assume that the end of the Cold War also marked the end of interest in nuclear weapons.""The Russian special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine was launched on 24 February in accordance with Article 51, Chapter VII, of the UN Charter:""Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security,"" the Charter reads.Article 51 was invoked by Russia after the US, NATO and the EU unanimously rejected Moscow's request to provide legal-binding guarantees of NATO's eastward non-expansion, Ukraine's non-admission to the bloc, removal of striking systems from Russia's doorstep as well as the withdrawal of the forces in Eastern Europe to the positions of 1997.In the beginning of the Russian special operation some NATO member states' issued threats to ""hold Russia"" and Belarus ""accountable'' for the move and threatened that Moscow would ""pay a price."" In the wake of the inflammatory rhetoric, Russia's nuclear deterrence forces were put on high alert on 27 February. Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned NATO member states against militarily engaging in the Ukraine crisis.Nevertheless, some Western policy-makers came up with ideas of sending a NATO contingent to Ukraine and implementing a ""limited no-fly zone"" in the Eastern European state. The bold proposals as well as Poland's plan to transfer 28 MiG-29 jets to Ukraine via the United States have been scrapped by Washington.The White House quoted both the threat of a potential nuclear escalation and expressed doubts that additional warplanes would anyhow change the balance of forces on the ground in Ukraine. Meanwhile, some US politicians, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, went even so far as to call for assassinating the Russian president, prompting a storm of criticism in the US social media over unnecessary escalation.Mainstream Media 'Hype' Over Ukrainian NPPs & Putin's 'Nuclear Card'There was also ""hype"" about Russians allegedly attacking Ukraine's nuclear power stations thus inviting the danger of nuclear collapse and contamination, according to George Szamuely. However, it turned out that it was the Ukrainian sabotage units who provoked clashes at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) on 4 March and attacked the power grid facilities that provide electricity to the Chernobyl NPP last week. Both sabotage attempts were repelled by the Russian military forces with nuclear reactors and critical infrastructure sustaining no damage.There's yet another fake idea being peddled by the Western media which says that Russian President Putin is ""getting desperate"" and might therefore use ""weapons of mass destruction,"" Szamuely notes. In particular, The New York Times quoted ex-US National Security Council official Fiona Hill speculating of Putin using ""a nuclear card."" NYT also published Thomas L. Friedman's op-ed which claimed that Russia is facing imminent ""defeat"" in Ukraine and would resort to ""using nuclear weapons.""However, the scholar suspects that it's not just scaremongering but the way of some opportunistic politicians to get the US and NATO involved in the Ukraine conflict.Arms Supplies are Exacerbating the ConflictWhile Joe Biden appears to understand what nuclear mutually assured destruction is all about, American and European conventional weapons continue to arrive in Ukraine, notes Siracusa. The Western military-industrial complex ""doesn't really care"" who NATO member states are at war against as it is seeking profits in the first place, according to the professor.What is worse, the threat is amplified by the weakness of the current leadership in Washington, according to George Szamuely. He warns that the US leadership is not putting a restraint on Western arms supplies to Ukraine, thus further exacerbating the conflict.Meanwhile, Russia's 13 March attack on the Yavorov military training base near the Ukrainian city of Lviv has drawn a clear red line on both foreign arms supplies and inflow of foreign mercenaries to Ukraine, the scholar remarks. ""Russia was sending a signal that if you continue along this path, if you continue to supply weapons to Ukraine, we will attack those convoys,"" he stresses.The arms supplies to Ukraine are aimed at prolonging the conflict, as NATO is willing to fight to ""the last Ukrainian and the last Russian,"" says Marko Gasic, London-based international affairs commentator.

German energy giant E.ON will halt the purchase of natural gas from Russian companies, but has no plans to withdraw from Nord Stream 1, company CEO Leonhard Birnbaum has said.""We buy our gas in wholesale markets in Europe. E.ON does not have long-term supply contracts directly with producers. However, a small amount of natural gas in our portfolio was purchased from Gazprom's trading companies in Europe. Due to the conflict in Ukraine, we stopped purchasing new volumes of gas from these companies. The Russian market is not among our target regions,"" Birnbaum said in a statement Wednesday.The CEO indicated that a prolonged shortage of energy imports will cause problems for the company in the long-term. ""The current situation certainly does not make our business easier,"" he said. He added that Germany can build a new LNG terminal before the end of 2023, with independence from Russian gas possible in 2-3 years.Russia delivered over 50 billion cubic meters of gas to Germany in 2021. The central European industrial power imported some 142 billion bcm the same year.Nord Stream 1 became fully operational in 2012, and was built after numerous conflicts over pricing and threats to cut off supplies between Gazprom and countries containing Soviet-built gas transit infrastructure in Eastern Europe. The pipeline network is operated by Nord Stream AG, 51 percent of which is owned by a Gazprom subsidiary, and 15.5 percent apiece by Germany's Wintershall and E.ON. Another 9 percent each is owned by NV Nederlandse Gasunie and France's Engie.Nord Stream 2, a Russian-European gas pipeline project complementing Nord Stream 1, was completed and made ready for operation late last year, with German regulators deliberately drawing out its certification process. The project's certification was suspended on 22 February by Berlin in response to Russia's recognition of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics as independent nations. That pipeline network's Switzerland-based operator filed for bankruptcy on 1 March. The crisis in Ukraine and uncertainty over the supply of Russian oil and gas to Europe and other markets has caused an unprecedented spike in energy prices. Gazprom and other Russian companies have promised to continue providing supplies to clients according to previously agreed contracts, with gas continuing to flow through Ukraine's gas transit infrastructure to European customers notwithstanding the Russian military operation in the country.

The United States is in close contact with Ukrainian authorities and international partners who are engaged in diplomatic efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday.

""We are in close contact as I said with Ukraineâ€™s leaders, including in my case Foreign Minister [Dmytro] Kuleba. We are in close contact with other countries that have in one way or another been engaging in diplomacy,"" Blinken said.

The United States wants Russia to make meaningful efforts to deescalate and engage in good-faith talks on the Ukraine crisis, Blinken added.

A policewoman in Swedish has been placed under internal investigation for having a portrait of Putin as a screensaver on her computer at the police station.The policewoman's loyalty is also being questioned by colleagues, who consider her a security risk. According to the newspaper Expressen, they are refusing to work with her after she said that Russia was not waging a â€œwarâ€ in Ukraine, referring to the ongoing special operation to demilitarise the country, and ventured that what is being said about it in the Swedish media was â€œfakeâ€. When questioned by Expressen, she emphasised that she has friends and relatives on both sides of the Ukrainian conflict.The policewoman is of Russian origin and is said to make frequent trips to Russia together with her husband. Her alleged sympathy for Putin and her homeland have sparked growing uncertainty among colleagues.According to Expressen, the police station was â€œbubbling with angerâ€ as the scandal is seen as a â€œserious breach of trustâ€.The woman became a Swedish citizen in the nineties and has since trained to become an active police officer.In her role as a border police officer, she has access to a number of systems with sensitive information, and also comes into contact with people from the former Soviet states during the operations carried out by the border force in the region where she works. According to her colleagues, she has been conducting some of the interviews with suspected aliens from former Soviet republics who don't speak Swedish in Russian, which functions as a lingua franca, without using a formal interpreter, which has raised further questions amid the current spy scare.The regional head of the border police declined to comment on individual cases. The woman is currently on sick leave.Following Russia's operation in Ukraine, which the West portrays as an â€œinvasionâ€ despite Moscow emphasising that it harbours no occupation plans and aims to protect the inhabitants of the Donbass People's Republics, anti-Russian sentiment has seen a major global rise, especially in the West, reaching levels unseen since the Cold War â€“ to the point where schoolchildren and preschoolers are being bullied and exposed to verbal abuse.

""Most people here in the US donâ€™t know anything about either the NATO expansion or the coup. If they did, they might be able to understand why we are in the present crisis. Even so, itâ€™s clear there is no appetite here for direct US involvement in the war,"" Wilayto said.The activist believes it is very important to break through government propaganda which depicts alleged Russian expansionism as the reason for the conflict.American mainstream media, however, shaped public opinion by promoting the government position, he continued. Wilayto also expressed frustration that the antiwar movement in the US has weakened over the years.Still, a number of protests against US involvement in the Ukraine crisis have taken place around the country, he said. One of those protests, co-sponsored by several human rights groups, took place outside NATO Command in Norfolk, Virginia.Speaking of US policy in Eastern Europe, Wilayto underscored Washingtonâ€™s desire to dominate in the region after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Some countries in the region could have grown into economic competitors of the West, but as conditions for receiving Western loans, they had to agree to shut down much of their own industry, he added.Both the US and NATO have the same approach to Russia, according to the activist, who is sure that they want to dominate Russia as well.""The West wants to dominate either by breaking it up like it did [with] former Yugoslavia or imposing ever more draconian sanctions in the hope that the Russian people will turn against their own government in favour of a more pro-Western one. If that happens, Russia would be reduced to one more vassal state of the West,"" he said.Wilayto opposes the idea of imposing sanctions.The real purpose of sanctions is to promote domestic unrest and, ultimately, what Washington calls ""regime change,"" he added.On 2 May 2014, Ukrainian nationalists locked protesters in Odessa's House of Trade Unions and set the building on fire. Forty-six people died and over 200 protesters were injured in the blaze and clashes with the radicals.US human rights activists formed the Odessa Solidarity Campaign to call for an international investigation into the massacre.On 24 February, Russia began a special operation to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine, responding to calls for help from the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics in countering the aggression of Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defence Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only. Several days into the operation, the Russian military accused the Ukrainian military of using typical terrorist methods, such as hiding behind civilians and in civilian quarters.

India's abstention from the United Nations (UN) resolutions which labelled Moscow as the ""aggressor"" in Ukraine as well as its refusal to draw down its energy or commercial ties with Russia amid western economic sanctions have been attracting veiled warnings from Washington.While White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said that India's decision this week to take up Russia's offer of cheaper crude won't ""violate"" the western sanctions, she advised New Delhi against supporting Moscow.""But also think about where you want to stand when history books are written at this moment in time. Support for the Russian leadership is support for an invasion that obviously is having a devastating impact"", Psaki remarked.India, meanwhile, has ""expressed deep concern"" over the situation in Ukraine and demanded an ""immediate cessation of violence"" from both sides.""We have reiterated at the highest levels of our leadership to all parties concerned that there is no other choice but the path of diplomacy and dialogue"", India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said in a statement this week.At the same time, New Delhi has also rejected ""unilateral"" sanctions imposed by the US, EU, and other allies against Russia, and has been looking for ways to sustain its energy and defence ties with Moscow.""The Ukraine conflict has major economic implications. Its impact on energy and commodity prices is already visible. The disruption of the global supply chain is expected to be significant. India has substantial dealings with both Russia and Ukraine"", the Indian FM said.Sputnik caught up with Yashwant Sinha, who previously served as India's finance and foreign minister. Sinha is presently the vice chairman of the Indian opposition group Trinamool Congress.Sputnik: The US and its western allies have been encouraging countries across the globe to cut trade ties with Russia. Should India follow their lead and take a stand against Russia?Yashwant Sinha: No. India has to look after its interests. If India's interests are served by not joining the western powers against Russia, then the stand taken by the government of India can't be faulted.At the same time, it is India's duty to explain to its friends why it prefers being neutral in the current situation.Sputnik: What do you think about India's decision to buy cheaper crude from Russia?Yashwant Sinha: India is right in taking up these offers. We must do what serves our national interest in the best manner.Sputnik: And do you back the idea of a rupee-rouble trading mechanism be set up to settle payments between India and Russia, with China's yuan as a reference currency?Yashwant Sinha: Yes, I do believe that we can carry our trade in our own currencies. But I don't think that the yuan should be made a reference currency. Any such arrangement should be done based on just the rupee and rouble.Sputnik: The US and the West blame Russia for the security crisis in Ukraine. Russia, on the other hand, accuses the US-led NATO of disregarding its security concerns over a period of time. One of Russia's major concerns has been NATO's continuous eastward expansion in five waves since the end of the Cold War. So, how do you view the current events in Ukraine?Yashwant Sinha: Well, there have been issues between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) with regards to Ukraine. There were some issues between Moscow and NATO over Crimea as well. I would rather prefer that the issues between NATO and Russia be resolved through dialogue rather than military means.Sputnik: Russian President Vladimir Putin says that the West has been trying to weaken Russia and doesn't want a strong Russia. Is a strong Russia in India's interest?Yashwant Sinha: First and foremost, a strong Russia is in Russia's interest. And a friendly Russia is surely in India's interest.However, at the same time, the complex issue for India relates to navigating the emerging global order. While Russia, indeed, is India's friend, one can't really say the same about China.A major question posed by Russia's actions [military operation] is that if China ever indulges in similar actions against India, how would we want the world to look at those?Sputnik: What role could India play in helping resolve this security crisis?Yashwant Sinha: India has a role and responsibility in bringing the military crisis to an end and bringing back peace to that region. India is Russia's time-tested friend and it should advise Moscow on the situation. And as India's friend, it is Russia's duty to listen to New Delhi's advice.Let's stay in touch no matter what!

In a strong rebuke to the US, India has said that it will continue to import energy from whatever sources suit its interests best, even if that means Russia.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday warned that buying Russian oil implies ""support for an invasion that obviously is having a devastating impact,"" although she acknowledged the purchases would not violate US sanctions.Indian government sources added that the jump in oil prices since the Ukraine conflict has increased the need to take advantage of competitive sourcing.Citing large importers of Russian oil and gas such as Germany, Italy, France, Netherlands, Poland, Lithuania, the sources noted that recent western sanctions on Moscow have exemptions to avoid the impact on energy imports from Russia.""Russian banks that are the main channel for European Union payments for Russian energy imports have not been excluded from SWIFT,"" the sources emphasised, sidestepping concerns expressed by several analysts about how the oil purchase from Russia is paid for.India, the world's third-largest energy-consumer, has secured 3 million barrels of crude oil as Russia offered it a deep discount to prevailing Brent crude. According to commodities data and analytic firm Kpler, India's acquisition from Russia touched 360,000 barrels a day of oil in March so far, nearly four times the 2021 average.Sources added that India might buy 15 million barrels of crude oil from Russia soon.Earlier this week, Russia's deputy prime minister Alexander Novak spoke with India's oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri. Energy has become a strong symbol of the long-standing ""special and privileged strategic partnership"" with Indian and Russian firms that have completed several joint projects since 2016.Rosneft owns 49 percent of Nayara Energy, India's private firm, which runs the country's second-largest refinery.A sudden rise in crude oil and gas prices has disrupted the Indian government's budget forecasts for the present financial year. As 85 percent of India's crude oil requirement (5 million barrels a day) has to be imported, higher prices for these commodities may cost India 1.6 percent of its annual gross national product.Most imports are from the Middle East (Iraq 23 percent, Saudi Arabia 18 percent, UAE 11 percent). The US has also become an important crude oil source for India (7.3 percent).

GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney has condemned fellow Republican, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, over her decision to point out the fact that over the past eight years in Ukraine, ""both sides"" routinely violated peace agreements and not just the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR), whom the US calls pro-Russian militias.In her address earlier this week, Greene said that compassion towards Ukrainians should not ""blind"" the US to ""reason and common sense"" and warned against calls that would result in an armed conflict between the US and Russia. She also raised concerns over the alleged conflict of interests in the US government, suggesting that President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senator Mitt Romney have financial stakes in Ukraine.Cheney, however, was not convinced by the GOP lawmaker's appeal and accused her of spreading lies, even though Greene mostly upheld the US government's narrative about Russia conducting an ""invasion"" of Ukraine â€“ something that the Kremlin strongly denies.While several US Congresspeople repeatedly called on the administration to do more in terms of supporting Ukraine as Russia is carrying out a special military operation on its territory, up to the point of imposing a no-fly zone, President Joe Biden firmly stood against using American or NATO military forces in the conflict. POTUS repeatedly underscored that such actions could easily prompt a Third World War. He also warned that such an armed conflict will likely turn into a nuclear one.Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the launch of the operation on 24 February at the behest of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR), setting its goals as the ""demilitarisation"" and ""de-Nazification"" of Ukraine. He stressed that Russia was left with no other choice as Kiev had failed to fulfil Minsk agreements and instead of peacefully resolving the conflict in Donbass continued to shell its cities â€“ a behaviour that Putin said was akin to a ""genocide"" of his own people.Let's stay in touch no matter what!

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has found himself in hot water after a recent speech at the Conservative Spring Conference in Blackpool, where he happened to compare Ukraine's resistance to the special Russian military operation in the country to the Brexit vote in 2016.The ""recent example"" did not appear to resonate with many critics, among them former European Council President Donald Tusk, senior backbench Tory Tobias Ellwood, and even several French diplomats.Political director at the French Foreign Ministry Philippe Errera weighed in on Johnson's remarks, followed by French Ambassador to the UK Catherine Colonna. ""As the French Ambassador in the UK, I will not either"", Colonna said after Errera said he would not ""comment on Twitter"".Ex-chief of staff at Number 10 Lord Barwell, commenting on Johnson's comparison, said that ""voting in a free and fair referendum isn't in any way comparable with risking your life to defend your country against invasion"".Others, however, weighed in to defend the prime minister's remarks. Among them was Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who said he did not think ""the prime minister was saying that they [the Ukrainian crisis and the Brexit vote] were directly analogous"". He also said that people ""will draw their own conclusions"".Boris Johnson himself has not yet addressed the backlash that followed his comments.The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in 2016, with Brexit officially occurring on the night from 31 January to 1 February 2020. Britons voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48%, according to the BBC.The conflict in Ukraine, for its part, has been underway since 24 February, when Russia launched a special military operation to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine. The Kremlin said it does not plan to occupy the country, nor are Russian troops targeting civilians, focusing exclusively on Ukrainian military infrastructure, according to the Russian Defence Ministry. Nations in the West - among them the United Kingdom - have condemned the operation and imposed harsh anti-Russian sanctions.Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The sour milk product kefir will be removed from Swedish stores for a while, as local manufacturer Arla deemed its packaging featuring trademark onion domes reminiscent of the world-known Saint Basil's Cathedral unsuitable and inappropriate in the current circumstances, citing Russia's special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, which the West portrays as an â€œinvasionâ€.While Arla's kefir is produced in Sweden and consists entirely of Swedish raw materials, Arla nevertheless decided to withdraw the product due to â€œRussian associationsâ€.Kefir is a fermented milk drink similar to thin yogurt made using a specific type of mesophilic symbiotic culture originating in the North Caucasus.Remarkably, sales of smetana, a fellow sour cream product common in Russian cuisine, will continue unperturbed, as Arla deemed its packaging more neutral.The decision by the Danish-Swedish dairy giant sparked a wave of outrage on Twitter.â€œSwedish Arla has decided to stop producing Kefir, because it's â€œtoo much associated with Russiaâ€ and â€œpresently unsuitableâ€. This is one of the most idiotic things I've heard. Have people completely lost their f***ing minds??? It's fermented milkâ€, one user wrote.Others called it â€œstupidity at the highest levelâ€.â€œToday, a package of Kefir became a protest against the madness of groupthink. This is what happens when you answer 'very important' to the question whether companies should take more social responsibility?â€ another one mused.â€œGod damn what hypocritical nonsense. There was no talk of discontinuing working with American Starbucks when NATO/US destroyed Libya, in violation of international lawâ€¦â€ another one chipped in.â€œA Swedish product by a Swedish company â€“ this is downright ridiculous. And by extension dangerous. Anything that can in any way be associated with anything Russian is pariah. Should my students named Igor, Boris and Anton be forced to change their names as well?â€ yet another mused.Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, responding to calls for help from the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The US and its Western allies retaliated by imposing massive sanctions against Russia, while many Western companies have also left the country's market in protest. Manufacturers and business owners have started pulling Russian or Russian-associated products as a token of their condemnation. Anti-Russian sentiment has also soared in the West, reaching Cold War-era levels â€“ to the point where schoolchildren are getting bullied and exposed to verbal abuse and people are persecuted for having Russian sympathies.

NATO Sends More Weapons to Ukraine Plane crashes in China, neocons call for no-fly zone in Ukraine, and SCOTUS hears cases regarding power and impunity of police officers.

At the top of the show, Keith Mackey, is the founder of Mackey International: an aviation consulting firm specializing in aviation safety, risk management, accident investigation, air carrier certification and safety/compliance audits joins the show to talk about the plane crash in China on Monday. The crash itself, from what we know so far, also seems weird. We only have initial reports, but the local emergency management department said it lost contact with the plane at 2:15. Five minutes later, the plane went into a deep dive at its cruising speed, AP says, â€œThe data suggests the plane crashed within a minute and a half of whatever went wrong.â€Next, Nicolas Davies, independent journalist, a researcher with CODEPINK, and the author of Blood on Our Hands: The American Invasion and Destruction of Iraq joins the show to talk about how Saturday marked the 19th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq, a war that technically ended in 2017, but in reality is still ongoing. More than one million Iraqis were killed and there was barely a mention of it in the US media. Also, over the weekend, Yemenâ€™s Houthis launched missile attacks on Saudi oil installations in Yanbu and elsewhere, damaging facilities, but causing no injuries. And, the US announced that it would send Patriot surface-to-air missiles to Saudi Arabia to protect it against future Houthi attacks. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made a surprise trip to the United Arab Emirates. It was his first visit there since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2009 and Assadâ€™s third trip abroad in that period. He met with the Crown Prince and leader of Dubai. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky remotely addressed the Israeli Knesset to ask for Israeli assistance and for the Israelis to impose sanctions on Russia. He received a polite response but no promises.Later in the show, Kimberly Dvorak, investigative journalist and political analyst covering foreign policy joins the show to talk about the split in the Republican Party between anti-war conservatives and neoconservatives. Senator Liz Cheney was on one of the Sunday morning talk shows calling for a No-Fly Zone. The Misfits talk about whether the rift is going to be a political problem for the Republicans campaigning in the 2022 midterms.Then, Daniel McDaniels, Executive Director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity. He has advised members of congress on foreign affairs, civil liberties and defense/intel policy calls in to talk about President Volodomyr Zelensky announced yesterday that 11 political parties would have to cease activity in the country. Most are small, but one is the countryâ€™s largest opposition party. The parties are accused of having links to Russia, though the new leader of the largest party, Opposition Party for Life, earlier this month called for an immediate ceasefire and for Russian troops to leave the country.For the last segment, Kim Keenan, adjunct Professor at George Washington University and Former General Counsel of the NAACP joins the show to talk about an interesting opinion piece in the Washington Post last week which presented two important cases before the Supreme Court that could affect the power and impunity of law enforcement. As it summed up, In one case the court will consider whether federal law enforcement agents who clearly, knowingly and willingly violate someoneâ€™s constitutional rights can even be held financially liable. In the other, it will decide whether two doctors should be held criminally culpable and imprisoned for 20 or more years based on law enforcement officialsâ€™ opinions about proper medical treatment â€” even if the doctors believed they were acting in their patientsâ€™ best interests. So we have a case about how law enforcement can be punished for brutality and how law enforcement should be involved in the opioid crisis.The Misfits sign off till tomorrowâ€¦We'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.comThe views and opinions expressed in this programme are those of the speakers and do not necessarily reflect the position of Sputnik.

A NATO official told the channel there is an increasing likelihood of Belarus entering the conflict in Ukraine to support Russian forces. Another intelligence official from the alliance stated the Belarusian government is preparing the environment to justify a ""Belarusian offensive against Ukraine.""A source in the Belarusian opposition claims that thousands of the countryâ€™s combat units are getting ready to head to Ukraine in the next few days, the report said.On Monday, Pentagon said that it has not seen any indications of Belarusian troops preparing to join the conflict.On February 24, Russia began its special military operation in Ukraine, responding to calls for help from the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk in defending themselves against the Ukrainian military. The Russian Defence Ministry said the operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only. The West has rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Russia and Belarus, accusing the latter of assisting Moscow.

Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the United States, said on Tuesday that supplying Kiev with weapons and foreign mercenaries is reckless and dangerous, as it could endanger not only Europe, but the entire world.Antonov additionally pondered whether the West realizes that ""thugs"" coming from all over the world to fight in Ukraine could use their effective military experience ""anywhere, including upon returning home.""The Russian diplomat suggested that NATO member states ""have forgotten how the United States spent decades searching for manpads [man-portable air-defense systems] handed over to the Afghan Mujahideen throughout the Middle East in the 1980s.""The Russian Embassy in the US has additionally accused Washington of deliberately delaying the destruction of chemical weapons, urging it to complete the process.On February 24, Russia announced the start of its special military operation in Ukraine, in response to Donbass republics' requests for assistance in repelling the increasing aggression of the Ukrainian troops. According to a Russian Defense Ministry statement, the special military operation is only aimed at Ukrainian military facilities. The Ukrainian military have been accused by the Kremlin of using terrorist tactics, including lurking behind civilians and frequenting residential quarters.In the first early days of the special military operation, Ukrainian authorities gave automatic weapons to an estimated tens of thousands of the nation's populace. After Kiev allowed the nation's civilian population to take up weapons, looting was reported in local media. Western countries continue to supply weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. Russia has consistently condemned these deliveries of fresh weapons to Ukrainian fighters as fueling the conflict.Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The US Embassy in Moscow has been handed a note with a list of diplomats to be deported from Russia in response to the expulsion of Russians from the diplomatic mission to the United Nations, the Russian Foreign Ministry has announced.""The American side was firmly told that any hostile actions of the United States against Russia would be met with a decisive and adequate response,"" the statement added.Russian UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya announced in late February that 12 employees of the Russian mission had been ordered to leave the United States by 7 March. Before that, the State Department moved to expel Sergei Trepelkov, Russia's second-ranking diplomat in Washington. Trepelkov was expelled after Russia kicked out US Embassy second-in-command Bart Gorman in response to the expulsion of yet another Russian diplomat from Washington. The US and Russian governments have engaged in tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats going back to the crisis in Ukraine in 2014. The practice was also common during the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union in the 20th century.Commenting on the Russian expulsion notice later Wednesday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said that the US Embassy serves as a ""locus of coordination and communication"" between the two countries, and that Washington does not want to see it ""closed down.""Russian-US relations hit a lowpoint unseen since the deepest depths of the Cold War last month after Moscow began a military operation in Ukraine aimed at ""demilitarizing"" the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead on the operation after weeks of escalating shelling, sniper and sabotage attacks by Ukrainian forces against the self-proclaimed Donbass republics, whose sovereignty Russia recognized on 21 February.The fighting in Ukraine is the culmination of a security crisis which began eight years ago, when US and EU-backed political forces overthrew Ukraine's unpopular but democratically elected government and proceeded to try to drag the heavily divided nation into the West's orbit. The coup in Kiev prompted Crimean authorities to organize a referendum on the peninsula's status, and sparked a civil conflict in the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk which effectively continues to this day.

On Thursday, the Russian Ministry of Defense revealed new information about US-funded biolabs it has discovered in eastern Ukraine amid the Kremlin's special â€œneutralizationâ€ operation in the nation. According to findings by Russiaâ€™s Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops, one company connected to these biolabs and their work was founded by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz, the latter the stepson of former US Secretary of State John Kerry.Rosemont Seneca Partners was founded in 2009 by Biden, Heinz and Heinzâ€™s college roommate and fellow financier, Devon Archer, according to the Financial Times. Biden and Heinz were described as company co-owners and Archer as a â€œmanaging partnerâ€ in a report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.The private equity firm was anchored by the Heinz family alternative investment fund, Rosemont Capital, and was formed to â€œbe populated by political loyalists and positioned to strike profitable deals overseas with foreign governments and officials with whom the US government was negotiating,â€ according to the 2018 book â€œSecret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,â€ by Peter Schweizer.This became a problem the following year, when BHR joined the Chinese state-owned defense firm Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) to buy anti-vibration automotive parts from American precision-parts manufacturer Henniges - a deal agreed to during the Obama administration. A US Senate investigation in 2019 found a significant conflict of interest in the deal, as anti-vibration technology is considered â€œdual use,â€ having both civilian and military applications.In one notable incident that Joe Biden boasted about years later but which Western media has tried to spin as conspiracy theory, Biden successfully pressured then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire Viktor Shokin, Ukraineâ€™s top prosecutor, who was heading an investigation of Zlochevsky and Burisma. Zlochevsky, meanwhile, was funneling millions to Hunter Biden and Archer for sitting on Burismaâ€™s board and for Rosemont Senecaâ€™s â€œconsulting services,â€ documents obtained by the Senate probe show.Rosemont Seneca sought to disguise its investments in Burisma, as did top Obama administration officials, including then-Secretary of State John Kerry - Heinzâ€™s stepfather. Heinz attempted to distance himself from Archerâ€™s and Hunterâ€™s decision to join the Burisma board, writing to Kerryâ€™s chief of staff, David Wade, that â€œbased only on Heinzâ€™s assurances, that â€˜Rosemont Seneca was not involvedâ€™ with Burisma,â€ Heinz told the Senate probe.According to the paper, Heinz pulled out of Rosemont as a result of his partnersâ€™ decision.â€œThe lack of judgment in this matter was a major catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his business relationships with Mr. Archer and Mr. Biden,â€ Bastardi suggested.

Sputnik: Speaking to Maverick Multimedia on 19 March, you said that Russiaâ€™s special operation in Ukraine is ""close to being over"" in Russia's favour and that Moscow's military op will later be studied by specialists. What's so special about Russia's operation, in your opinion?Scott Ritter: I think the thing that separates the Russian special operation in Ukraine, apart from other military operations of this nature, is the fact that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine. This is something that the Russian leadership has said from the very start. A military operation that is designed to occupy is a much more complicated operation requiring significantly more troops. It is about holding cities, holding roads, holding specific geographical areas. This kind of focus allows Russia to avoid the trap of being compelled to carry out operations to conquer territory, instead, to focus on a more specific task of eliminating military formations with the goal of eventually leaving Ukraine.Sputnik: Why are the Western mainstream media continuing to claim that Russia's Ukraine operation has stalled? Does it mean that they do not understand Russia's strategy and objectives? Or does this narrative serve some other purposes?Scott Ritter: I think there are two reasons why the West is mischaracterising the Russian military operation in Ukraine. First is that the West is evaluating this as if it were Russia's intent to occupy Ukraine. From the very start, the fact that Russia is coming in with only 200,000 troops makes no military sense when we are speaking of a nation of 40 million people with a combined military capability of around 600,000 troops. The other aspect of the mischaracterisation is that there is an information warfare aspect to this war. The West is hopeful that they will be able to use the Russian operation in Ukraine as a vehicle to motivate domestic political unrest in Russia that will at a minimum compel the Russian leadership to withdraw from Ukraine with its mission unfinished, and at a maximum lead to the overthrow, the removal of the Russian president and the Russian government, sort of a colour revolution, if you'd like to say so. In order to do this, they are creating a picture of a military disaster in Ukraine on the part of the Russian military, and they're trying to project this narrative of a military disaster back into Russia in an effort to demoralise the Russian population and provide the impetus for massive popular demonstrations against the Russian government.Sputnik: Western pundits, politicians and experts are speculating about Russia's ""possible chemical attack"" in Ukraine. They have not presented evidence that Russia possesses such weapons, nor provided any proof that such plans exist. What could be the primary purpose of this narrative?Scott Ritter: The current narrative being put out by Western leaders and the Western media about the Russians preparing a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine is born of the standard reaction when one side is caught doing something that they shouldn't have been doing and they seek to project blame onto the other side. There is no doubt in my mind that the Russians are not preparing a chemical weapons attack. This makes no sense from both a military and political standpoint. Plus, it presumes the existence of a military-scale chemical warfare capability in Russia that Russia simply doesn't possess.But what has happened is that Russia has discovered biological research facilities inside Ukraine, operated by the United States Department of Defense, and they've discovered certain research activities which are difficult to explain by the United States that could have offensive biological warfare capacity. And the United States is embarrassed by this. So, it's deflecting the narrative back on to Russia. And in doing so, they expand the narrative based upon past allegations that Russia supported chemical weapons used by the Syrian government in Syria, that Russia used chemical agents against the Skripal family in the United Kingdom. That Russia used chemical agents against the political dissident Navalny in Russia. And therefore, because Russia is ""guilty"" of all three of these things, Russia is preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. It's an absurdity. It's ridiculous, but it's part and parcel of the ongoing information warfare campaign being waged by the West against Russia.Sputnik: NATO has been increasing its military presence along its eastern borders since the beginning of the Russian special operation in Ukraine. What's behind this military build-up, in your opinion?Scott Ritter: The ongoing NATO build-up on its eastern flank, I believe, is an exercise in confidence-building on the part of NATO. We are talking about an organisation that has just gone through, in this past summer, a terribly demoralising withdrawal from Afghanistan. One that made it question its relationship with the premiere power in NATO, the United States. And question the ongoing viability of NATO as a military alliance. I mean what is the purpose of NATO? The Russian incursion into Ukraine has breathed new life into those who believe that there is an ongoing purpose to NATO. But it is one thing to say NATO is relevant, it is another thing to make NATO relevant. And one of the things we know about NATO in the past decade or so is that it is militarily impotent. It doesn't have viable military capacity.There are ongoing discussions in Brussels right now in the emergency summit that NATO has convened about the possibility of putting NATO's peacekeeping forces into western Ukraine. You know, this is insanity. Under any circumstances, NATO does not have the ability to do this and prevail. But again, they've assembled these forces, they're looking in the mirror, they think they like what they see and they think that there's real muscle there. And, who knows, they may be compelled to believe that they have more capability than they really do and try to project these forces in the west of Ukraine, in which case there will be, unfortunately, a military clash between NATO and Russia.Sputnik: What are the odds of NATO troops getting involved in the Ukraine conflict?Scott Ritter: If someone had asked me at the beginning of the Russian incursion into Ukraine what are the odds of NATO getting involved? I would say zero because NATO had made it clear that it was not going to get involved in any fight between Ukraine and Russia on Ukrainian territory. But as this conflict goes on, as millions and millions of Ukrainians seek refuge in NATO countries, we're now looking at an economic and humanitarian catastrophe for NATO. And there are now people talking about not just imposing a no-fly zone, but actually putting NATO peacekeepers on the ground in western Ukraine.I don't think NATO is going to make the decision today to send peacekeepers in, but I do think this issue is being discussed and will be tabled for consideration at a later date. And that later date could come sooner rather than later if more and more refugees appear at the border between Ukraine and NATO nations like Romania, Hungary, and Poland.

Western efforts to isolate Russia on the international stage were dealt another blow as Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saturday that Russians will be free to carry out commercial activities in Turkey.â€œIf Russian oligarchs or any Russian citizens want to visit Turkey, of course they can,â€ Cavusoglu declared in response to a question given at Doha Forum international conference.Cavusoglu has given the indication that Russian nationals will not face additional impediments to commercial ventures in Turkey.Turkey, a member of NATO, has declined to sanction Russian citizens or close its airspace to Russian aircraft.Referring to the â€œRussia-Ukraine crisisâ€ after this weekâ€™s NATO leaders' summit in Brussels, Turkish President Recep Erdogan said, â€œTurkey's main aim is to reconcile the parties.â€The country has taken a considerably less antagonistic position to the ongoing Russian special military operation aimed at denazifying and demilitarizing Ukraine than most of its European neighbors and is publicly considering implementing a Ruble-Lira exchange for the countriesâ€™ tourism sectors.The Turkish government previously announced it was closing off access to the Black Sea to warships in response to petitions by western nations to invoke a 1936 international agreement that lets â€œAnkara manage war traffic entering the two sea lanes during times of conflict,â€ but it only did so after a lengthy delay.Itâ€™s unclear whether the action has had any significant impact on the balance of forces in Ukraine. Turkey has also sold a number of Bayraktar TB2 drones to the Ukrainian regime.Turkey is just one of a number of increasingly independent countries drawing the ire of the US and leading European powers for their apparent failure to express sufficient animosity towards Russia.Hungary, another NATO nation and a member of the European Union, has also declined to participate in the Western campaign to alienate Russia. They have been similarly straightforward about the need to prioritize the development of their own economy over getting involved in foreign conflicts.The comments seemed to come in a response to a surprisingly disrespectful video address Friday in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky openly demanded the Prime Minister â€œdecide for yourself who you are with,â€ and addressed Orban by his first name: â€œListen, Viktor, do you know whatâ€™s going on in Mariupol?â€The coastal city of Mariupol has been under the control of the Ukrainian National Guardâ€™s neo nazi Azov Batalion, but reports indicate Russian forces have made serious advances recently.Survivors whoâ€™ve managed to escape have accused the Azov soldiersâ€”many of whom are open admirers of Adolf Hitlerâ€”of numerous potential war crimes, including refusing to allow the civilian population to evacuate via humanitarian corridors organized by Russia. And according to a widely-shared article in independent outlet The Grayzone, â€œtestimony by evacuated Mariupol residents and warnings of a false flag attack undermine the Ukrainian governmentâ€™s claims about a Russian bombing of a local theater sheltering civilians.â€

US President Joe Biden's emotional exclamation ""for Godâ€™s sake, this man cannot remain in power"" in reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin might severely escalate tensions between Washington and Moscow, which is now more confident than ever that the West is bent on staging a coup in the country, several foreign policy experts, analysts, columnists, and Western media outlets have warned.The Financial Times (FT) called Biden's line about Putin a ""turning point"" in America's approach to the conflict in Ukraine. Prior, Washington had tried to balance its rhetoric, while now it's transitioned to a ""fierce strategic rivalry"" with Russia.The head of the US Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haass, criticised Biden's closing line about Putin, noting that ousting the Russian president is not something Washington has the tools to accomplish. At the same time, the president's speech created risks that Putin will ""reject compromise, escalate, or both"", Haass warned.Michael Goodwin, a contributor for the New York Post, condemned the entire Biden speech and specifically targeted his line about Putin. Goodwin argued that it would ""dramatically raise the stakes with Russia"" as the US administration was seeking to lower them.Joe Biden's entire speech, which was dedicated to the topic of a ""long war"" and rarely touched upon peace, suggests that a ""new Cold War [is] on our hands"" with POTUS as its Western leader, David Gergen, a former White House adviser, told the Financial Times. Gergen cautioned that such a speech heavily suggests that the current conflict won't be ""settled at the negotiating table"".Not Going to WashEven before Biden could depart Poland, where he delivered his speech, the White House was quick to rescind its last line â€“ about Vladimir Putin â€“ and assured that POTUS was not calling for regime change in Russia. Furthermore, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried to interpret Biden's words differently the next day, claiming that POTUS meant that ""Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression"".Western commentators, however, remained unconvinced, warning that the same is likely to be true for the Kremlin, and harshly criticised â€“ either Biden for making reckless comments off the cuff or his team for allowing such a line in the text of the speech. FT suggested that even a single hint that Washington is contemplating regime change in Moscow might prompt the Kremlin to believe that the US is ""losing control of its message about the war"".Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, insisted that Biden's message will be strongly believed in Moscow.Haass stated that the line being off-script (something that has not yet been officially confirmed), will only reinforce the Kremlin's fears as it will consider Biden's words ""this man cannot remain in power"" as his genuine belief.Putin heard a call for regime change ""loud and clear"" in Biden's speech, former Defence Intelligence Agency officer, Rebekah Koffler, told Fox News. She claimed that Putin has long suspected the US of trying to stage a ""colour revolution"" or a civil uprising in Russia, and now he's got his confirmation. Koffler lashed out at the controversial line in Biden's script and called the people who prepared it ""incompetent"", since this phrase failed to ""minimise security threats"" for the American people.New York Post contributor Michael Goodwin stressed that in the context of Biden's speech in Poland, his phrase about Putin not being allowed to ""remain in power"" is impossible to be comprehended as anything but a call for regime change. The White House might explain itself in the future, but it will never be ""good enough"", Goodwin warned.The Biden administration, for example, the national security adviser or the secretary of state, must reach out to Moscow and elaborate on Joe Biden's comment, Richard Haass said. They must explain to the Kremlin that the comment was made in the heat of the moment and that it in no way reflects US foreign policy, the president of the think tank suggested.Let's stay in touch no matter what!
